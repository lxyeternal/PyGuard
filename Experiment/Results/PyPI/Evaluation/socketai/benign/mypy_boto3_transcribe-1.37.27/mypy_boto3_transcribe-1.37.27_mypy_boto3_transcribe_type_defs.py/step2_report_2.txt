  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security implications, and consistency with typical SDK type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code provides type definitions for the AWS Transcribe SDK, including TypedDict classes, constants, and conditional imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of data leaks or malicious data flow; primarily static type annotations.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a standard set of type definitions, with no executable logic or external network calls.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, auto-generated SDK type definitions. No malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Confidence:** 1, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** This report is accurate. The code is purely static type definitions with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines detailed type annotations for the SDK, including imports and class definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks or external calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No dynamic code execution, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Strictly static type annotations; no runtime logic or data handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, well-structured type definitions, no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is standard type annotation code, with no malicious features.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on type definitions for AWS Transcribe components.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Analysis:** Pure type definitions, conditional imports for compatibility, no executable logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Non-malicious, safe SDK type definitions.\n- **Confidence:** 1, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious or obfuscated code present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines types for AWS Transcribe SDK, mainly for static analysis.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data flow or external calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Static type annotations only, no executable logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK type definitions.\n- **Confidence:** 1, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is purely declarative.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type definitions for AWS Transcribe SDK, with mention of potential data leak points.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Attributes like Uri and RoleArn are potential data leak points if untrusted data is supplied externally, but no direct malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No dynamic code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a set of TypedDicts and type annotations, serving as data schemas.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, well-structured type definitions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The mention of potential data leak points is standard for attributes like URIs and ARNs but does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a comprehensive set of static type definitions for the AWS Transcribe SDK.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior in any report.\n- **Security Risks:** No active security risks are present; the code is purely declarative.\n- **Consistency of Scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a risk score of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — purely static type definitions, no runtime or external risks.\n\nThis code is a standard, auto-generated type definition module intended for static type checking, with no malicious or security-compromising features.\n\n---\n\n**Summary conclusion:**  \n**The code is benign, well-structured, and contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.**",
