{
  "purpose": "Define detailed type annotations for the AWS Transcribe service SDK using TypedDict, Union, and type aliases.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, and local literals module; class definitions with type annotations and constants.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sinks or external network calls present.",
  "flows": "None; code primarily static type definitions without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious hardcoded data. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of Python type annotations, TypedDict definitions, constants, and conditional imports based on sys.version_info. No executable logic, data handling, or external calls are present. The code appears to serve as type definitions for SDKs, and does not process or manipulate runtime data. The import statements and conditional typing imports are standard and well-structured. No anomalies, malicious patterns, or obfuscated code are identified. The overall structure is consistent with auto-generated SDK type definitions. No potential security issues or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for the AWS Transcribe SDK, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely as static type annotations, posing no threat or malicious behavior.",
