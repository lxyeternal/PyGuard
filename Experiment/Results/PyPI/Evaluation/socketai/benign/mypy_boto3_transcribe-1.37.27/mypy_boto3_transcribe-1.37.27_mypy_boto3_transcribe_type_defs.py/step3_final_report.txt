{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type definitions, data schemas, and constants for the AWS Transcribe SDK, primarily for type safety, documentation, and static analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Type annotations within TypedDict classes, constants, and conditional imports for compatibility; no runtime data sources or external input handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; attributes like URIs and ARNs are data schema fields, not active data flows.",
  "flows": "The code defines data structures without executable logic; no data flow or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations, TypedDict classes, union types, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It contains no executable code, dynamic code execution, or network operations. The structure is straightforward, serving as data schemas for SDK usage, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, auto-generated set of type definitions for the AWS Transcribe SDK. It contains no executable logic, no malicious patterns, and no security vulnerabilities. It is intended solely for static type checking and documentation.",
