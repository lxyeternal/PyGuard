  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code provides type definitions for AWS Transcribe SDK, mainly static data structures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of data leaks or malicious data flow; data flows are within type annotations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code is purely data schema definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes the code is benign with high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** This is accurate. The code is a set of type definitions, with no executable logic or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as defining detailed type annotations for the SDK.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network calls are present.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or dynamic code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Properly states the code is static type annotations with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is purely for type safety and documentation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as defining types for AWS Transcribe SDK.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data processing or external communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Properly states the code is declarative, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is standard SDK type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as static type definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No executable or dynamic code, only data schemas.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly concludes the code is benign and purely declarative.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. The code contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code defines type annotations for AWS Transcribe.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious data flows are evident.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Properly concludes the code is a legitimate type definition module.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type definitions with no executable logic, network calls, or secrets.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Zero across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** None detected.\n- **Scores:** The original reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which are appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a collection of TypedDict classes, constants, and union types for static type checking.\n- It uses conditional imports for compatibility but no dynamic or executable code.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are present.\n- The purpose is to facilitate type safety and documentation for SDK consumers.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, auto-generated set of type definitions for AWS SDK, with no security concerns.",
