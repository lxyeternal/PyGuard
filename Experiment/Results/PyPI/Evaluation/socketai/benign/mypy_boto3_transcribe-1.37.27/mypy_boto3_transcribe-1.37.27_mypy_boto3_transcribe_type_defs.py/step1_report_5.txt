  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS Transcribe service, enabling type checking and clarity in SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Constant imports, type annotations, and data structure definitions from standard libraries and imported type literals.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points include string attributes like Uri and RoleArn, but only if untrusted data is supplied externally; no direct sinks for malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to structured data passing through typed dictionaries; no executable code or data manipulation present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The code strictly defines types and data schemas.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of TypedDict definitions and type annotations for a Python SDK related to AWS Transcribe. It conditionally imports typing modules based on Python version, and defines data schemas for requests, responses, and service-specific entities. No executable logic, no dynamic code, and no indication of malicious behavior are present. The code appears to be standard type declaration code designed for type safety and documentation. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, well-structured set of type definitions for an AWS SDK module. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is purely declarative, serving as type hints and data schemas, with no executable or suspicious code.",
