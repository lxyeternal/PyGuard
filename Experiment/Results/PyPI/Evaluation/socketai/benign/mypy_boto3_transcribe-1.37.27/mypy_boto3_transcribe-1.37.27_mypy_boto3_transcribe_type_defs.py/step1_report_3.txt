{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structures for various AWS Transcribe services and related components, intended for type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (__future__, sys, datetime, typing), local module literals, and built-in types (dict, list, etc.). No input sources from external data or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily defines types and data structures, with no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows; the code only sets up type annotations and TypedDict schemas.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, such as dynamic code execution, backdoors, or hidden operations. Usage of conditional imports for type annotations is standard practice for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely focused on defining TypedDict classes and type aliases for AWS Transcribe SDK, with no executable logic or data processing. It uses standard Python typing practices, including conditional imports for compatibility. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or other malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-malicious, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS SDK usage. It poses no security risk, does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.",
