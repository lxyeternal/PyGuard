{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations for various AWS Transcribe-related data structures and API request/response formats, primarily for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads only static type definitions, constants, and imported type literals; no input or external data sources are read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no data writes, network operations, or external command executions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or control flows involving untrusted input; the code solely declares type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious logic. It is a straightforward collection of type definitions with conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and type extension modules conditionally, then defines numerous TypedDict classes and Unions representing AWS Transcribe data models. No functions, data processing, or runtime logic are present. The code is purely declarative, serving as type hints for static analysis tools. There are no embedded or dynamic code executions, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious constructs. The structure and content align with typical SDK type definitions, with version-dependent imports handled properly. The code is well-structured, consistent, and devoid of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static type definitions for AWS Transcribe SDKs, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It is purely declarative and serves for type safety and documentation.",
