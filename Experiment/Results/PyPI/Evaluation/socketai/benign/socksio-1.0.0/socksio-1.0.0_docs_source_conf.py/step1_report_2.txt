  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder, primarily for project documentation and theme customization.",
  "sources": "Import of the 'socksio' module and use of 'datetime.date.today()'.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data is written or transmitted to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'datetime.date.today()' into the 'copyright' string; 'socksio.__version__' is read for 'release' variable.",
  "anomalies": "Import of 'socksio' without any apparent usage beyond reading its version. No actual code execution or network activity. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with typical settings. It imports 'datetime' and 'socksio', uses the date for a copyright string, and retrieves the package version. No data is sent externally, no user inputs processed, and no suspicious code constructs are present. The 'socksio' library is imported solely to access its version attribute, which is a common practice in package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration script for documentation generation. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The import of 'socksio' is standard and limited to version retrieval. No security concerns are evident.",
