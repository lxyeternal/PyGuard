  "purpose": "Configuration for the Sphinx documentation builder, setting project info, extensions, and themes.",
  "sources": "Import of 'socksio' module, usage of 'datetime.date.today()'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "The code reads data from 'datetime' and 'socksio' modules; the data is used for configuration purposes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'socksio' module, but no indication of malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file. It imports 'datetime' and 'socksio', then uses 'datetime.date.today().year' to set the copyright year and 'socksio.__version__' for version info. There are no input validation, no network calls, and no suspicious code patterns. The 'socksio' import is benign if the package is legitimate; there's no evidence of malicious activity or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical configuration file for documentation, with no malicious code or security risks detected. Usage of 'socksio' appears legitimate, and no anomalies or malware signals are present.",
