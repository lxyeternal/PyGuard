  "anomalies": "Use of 'socksio' package's version for release info; no suspicious or malicious code behavior. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code features present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with typical imports and settings. The 'socksio' module is imported to access its version info, which is a common practice. No data input or output is observed that could be exploited. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign Sphinx configuration file utilizing a third-party package only for retrieving version info. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
