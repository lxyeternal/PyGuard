  "purpose": "Define a type alias for variables that can be either string or bytes.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data output or external sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or data processing occurring in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports the 'typing' module and creates a type alias 'StrOrBytes' for a union of 'str' and 'bytes'. It serves as a type hinting convenience for other parts of a larger program. There are no sources or sinks, no data processing, and no complex logic. It appears to be a standard, harmless utility definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign type alias definition with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any data operations or include any suspicious constructs.",
