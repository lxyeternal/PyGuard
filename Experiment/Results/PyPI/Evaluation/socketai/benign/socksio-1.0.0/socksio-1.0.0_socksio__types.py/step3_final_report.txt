{
  "purpose": "Define a type alias 'StrOrBytes' as a Union of str and bytes for type hinting purposes.",
  "sources": "Import of 'typing' module; no data input or output operations.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; the code only defines a type alias without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, minimal code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'typing' and creates a type alias 'StrOrBytes' for Union[str, bytes]. It contains no data sources, sinks, or flows, and performs no operations that could be malicious. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements justify these assessments. No anomalies or obfuscation are present, and the code does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard type alias definition used solely for type hinting. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No security concerns, malware, or obfuscation are present.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
