  "purpose": "Define a type alias for variables that can be either a string or bytes.",
  "sources": "No data input or reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data output or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are established in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple type alias definition with no unusual or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'typing' module and creates a type alias 'StrOrBytes' for a union of 'str' and 'bytes'. This is a straightforward type annotation pattern used in Python for type hinting. There are no inputs, outputs, or operations that could be malicious. The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modification. It appears to serve as a utility for type hinting within a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type alias definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard pattern used for type annotations.",
