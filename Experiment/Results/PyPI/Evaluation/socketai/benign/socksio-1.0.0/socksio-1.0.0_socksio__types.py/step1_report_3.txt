  "purpose": "Define a type alias for variables that can be either a string or bytes.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, only defining a type alias without any unusual or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the typing module, defines a type alias 'StrOrBytes' as a Union of str and bytes. There are no data inputs, outputs, or any dynamic or malicious operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is simple and serves as a type hint for other code components.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign type alias definition with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, harmless utility snippet.",
