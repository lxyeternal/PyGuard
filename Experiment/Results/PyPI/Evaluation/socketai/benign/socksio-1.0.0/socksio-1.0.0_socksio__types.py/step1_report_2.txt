  "purpose": "Define a type alias for a variable that can be either a string or bytes.",
  "sources": "None; the code only declares a type alias without reading input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow as there are no operations or data handling statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the typing module and creates a type alias 'StrOrBytes' for a union of str and bytes. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows, nor any operations that could introduce security issues. The code serves a simple type annotation purpose without executing any logic or handling data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic type alias definition with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is benign and does not pose any security risk.",
