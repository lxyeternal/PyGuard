  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - The code is a straightforward import of the `typing` module and a type alias `StrOrBytes = Union[str, bytes]`.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, or operations.\n   - No network activity, no data processing, no system modifications.\n   - The code is purely for type hinting within a larger codebase.\n\n2. **Assessment of Each Report:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, minimal, and standard.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are noted.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - Since the code is a simple type alias definition, there are no reasons to assign any risk or malware scores above 0.\n   - The reports seem consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n5. **Final Justification:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified.\n   - The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\nThe code is a benign utility snippet with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. It is a standard, harmless type alias definition used for type hinting in Python.",
