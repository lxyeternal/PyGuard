{
  "purpose": "Defines a type alias for a variable that can be either a string or bytes, typically used for type hinting in Python functions or classes.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leakage points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as the code only defines a type alias.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the typing module and defines a type alias 'StrOrBytes' as a Union of str and bytes. This is a common practice in Python for type hints. There are no data sources, sinks, or data flows, and no suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign type alias definition for type hinting, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
