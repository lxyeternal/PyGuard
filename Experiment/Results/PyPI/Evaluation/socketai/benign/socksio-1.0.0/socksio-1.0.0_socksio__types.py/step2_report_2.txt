  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: importing `typing` and defining a type alias `StrOrBytes = Union[str, bytes]`.\n- No data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- The code is straightforward and serves as a utility for type hinting.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Confirms benign intent; no malicious behavior.  \n- Score: malware=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- The reasoning is sound; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Same conclusions as Report 1.  \n- Score: malware=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- Reasoning is consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Reiterates benign nature; no suspicious activity.  \n- Score: malware=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- Justification is appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Also finds no issues; straightforward utility code.  \n- Scores align with the analysis.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same conclusion: benign, standard pattern.  \n- Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious intent or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is justified because the code does not introduce any security risks.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- The scores seem appropriate and consistent across all reports.\n- Given the code's simplicity and the absence of any suspicious elements, no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final expert assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard type alias definition with no security concerns. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores reflect the actual risk level accurately.\n\n**Summary:**  \nI agree with the current assessments. The code is harmless, and the scores are justified. No further action or adjustment needed.",
