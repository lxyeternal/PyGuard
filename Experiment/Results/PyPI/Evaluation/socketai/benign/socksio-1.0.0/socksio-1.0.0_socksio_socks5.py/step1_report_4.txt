{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS5 protocol request and response handling, including authentication, command requests, and connection state management.",
  "sources": "Code reads from class instances (e.g., dumps() and loads() methods), input parameters (e.g., addresses, data), and the receive_data method processing incoming data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the dumps() methods generating binary data to send, and the receive_data() method processing incoming network responses.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (addresses, request objects, raw network data) into dumps() or loads() methods, then into internal buffers, and is processed to update connection state or generate output data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code straightforwardly implements SOCKS5 protocol steps. There are no suspicious network operations, external data leaks, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly adheres to the SOCKS5 protocol specifications, with methods for encoding/decoding request and reply messages, managing connection states, and handling authentication workflows. It performs no network operations beyond preparing data for transmission or parsing received data. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. It does not contain any malicious payloads, code injection, or privacy-invasive actions. The code appears clean, well-structured, and typical of a SOCKS5 protocol implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS5 protocol handling, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It focuses on protocol compliance and connection state management without performing any suspicious or harmful operations.",
