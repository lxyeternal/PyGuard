  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for socket errors and protocol errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading in this code snippet",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow as there are only class definitions with no runtime execution",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, SOCKSError and ProtocolError, for error handling related to socket operations. These classes are straightforward, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class and from each other, with no embedded logic or data. There are no input sources, data sinks, or flow control. The code is minimal and standard in structure, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains standard exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is purely structural and designed for error handling in socket-related modules.",
