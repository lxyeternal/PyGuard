  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for SOCKS errors and protocol errors.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual or suspicious code behavior is absent; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two custom exception classes inheriting from built-in Exception classes. It contains no dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or data handling. No potential security vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The code appears standard for custom exception definition and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign definition of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concern. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
