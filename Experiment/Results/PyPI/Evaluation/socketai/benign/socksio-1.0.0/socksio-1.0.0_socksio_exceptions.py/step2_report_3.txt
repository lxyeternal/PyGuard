  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n```python\nclass SOCKSError(Exception):\n    \"\"\"Generic exception for when something goes wrong\"\"\"\n\nclass ProtocolError(SOCKSError):\n    pass\n```\n\n**Presence of Issues:**\n- The code is a straightforward definition of two custom exception classes.\n- No data input/output, no dynamic execution, no embedded secrets, no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- No obfuscation or complex logic.\n- The classes serve as error categorization, typical in error handling modules.\n\n**Evaluation of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as benign, with no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks.\n- They correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes, with no data flow, no input/output, and no malicious intent.\n- The reasoning is sound and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malware or malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear class definitions.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no changes are necessary.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, given the code's simplicity.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is accurate.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, harmless pattern for defining custom exceptions.\n- The reports are accurate, and their scores are justified.\n- No additional risks or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Based on the code and reports, I would assign the following scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n\nThese match the reports' assessments and are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores are justified. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
