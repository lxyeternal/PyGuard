  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for SOCKS-related errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present",
  "sinks": "No data output or sensitive data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow paths within the code",
  "anomalies": "Use of exception class inheritance, which is standard; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two custom exception classes inheriting from built-in Exception. There are no data processing, input/output, or potentially malicious operations. The structure is typical for defining specific exception types in Python. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
