  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only defines two custom exception classes: `SOCKSError` and `ProtocolError`.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No code in the snippets reads from or writes to untrusted sources, nor does it perform any operations beyond class inheritance.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions.\n   - They correctly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard for defining exception classes.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are identified or implied in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (high confidence, which is appropriate)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (correct, as code is clear)\n     - `malware`: 0 (correct, no malicious code)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (appropriate, no security risk)\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no runtime behavior, no security risk exists.\n   - The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent or activity.\n   - Therefore, risk scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - They avoid speculative claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nGiven the simplicity and clarity of the code, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative in their scoring.\n\n**In conclusion, I agree with the provided scores and assessments.**",
