  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for socket and protocol errors",
  "sources": "None; code contains only class definitions with no input or data reading",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output operations",
  "flows": "No data flow, as there are no source-to-sink interactions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class inheritance for exceptions",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior. The classes serve to categorize specific socket and protocol errors. The implementation is minimal and standard, with no indication of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining exception classes with no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears safe, with no security risks or malware indicators.",
