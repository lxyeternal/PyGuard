  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the overall security implications.\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**:\n   - All reports describe the code as defining two custom exception classes (`SOCKSError` and `ProtocolError`) inheriting from Python's `Exception`. \n   - The original code snippet confirms this: it's straightforward class definitions with no additional logic, data handling, or dynamic execution.\n   - No evidence of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation is present.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**:\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, standard, and contains no suspicious behavior.\n   - Given the simplicity of the code, this assessment is accurate.\n   - No flawed reasoning or overestimations are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - Since the code is purely structural, defining exception classes without runtime logic or data processing, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n\n4. **Malware and Obfuscation**:\n   - The malware score is correctly zero across all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - Obfuscation is correctly marked as zero; the code is straightforward.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No false positives or unwarranted security concerns are suggested.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency and Recommendations**:\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment.\n   - The scores align with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a minimal, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns. The reports' evaluations are accurate and well-founded. No further action or scoring adjustments are needed.",
