{
  "purpose": "Defines two custom exception classes, SOCKSError and ProtocolError, for error handling in network protocols.",
  "sources": "Class definitions do not read input or data; no external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; code does not process or leak data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are static definitions with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; straightforward class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions inheriting from Exception, with no dynamic behavior, data handling, or embedded secrets. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1—are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present, and the code does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
