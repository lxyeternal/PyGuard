{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for socket errors and protocol errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or security-sensitive operations",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing present",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of exception class definitions with no suspicious or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code declares two custom exception classes inheriting from built-in Exception and SOCKSError respectively. There are no input/output operations, no data handling, no dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns. The classes serve as custom error types and do not contain any executable or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward class inheritance for exception handling with no malicious intent or security risks.",
