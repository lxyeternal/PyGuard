{
  "purpose": "Provide a backport implementation of functools.singledispatchmethod for Python versions earlier than 3.7, enabling single-dispatch method functionality.",
  "sources": "Standard library modules (functools, typing)",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external system interactions",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; code mainly defines classes and functions for dispatching",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed; standard implementation of a dispatch class",
  "analysis": "The code defines a fallback implementation of singledispatchmethod for older Python versions, encapsulating functools.singledispatch within a class. It performs type checks on the input functions, uses functools for dispatching, and sets up method registration and descriptor behavior. There are no indications of malicious logic or external data leakage. The code appears to be a benign compatibility utility that extends functionality without harmful side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation of a compatibility feature for Python's method dispatching. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
