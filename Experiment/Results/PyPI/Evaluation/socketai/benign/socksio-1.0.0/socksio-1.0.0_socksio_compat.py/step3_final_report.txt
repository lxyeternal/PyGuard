  "purpose": "Compatibility shim for Python versions earlier than 3.7, implementing a backport of functools.singledispatchmethod.",
  "sources": "Function definitions, attribute checks, method registration, dispatching mechanisms within the class.",
  "sinks": "Dispatch function calls, method registration, attribute updates; all standard for dispatching, not malicious.",
  "flows": "Function registration via register method, dispatching based on argument types, method invocation through __get__.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious code, no external data handling, no network activity, standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility utility that conditionally defines a class to emulate 'singledispatchmethod' for older Python versions. It uses standard library functions, attribute checks, and method dispatching patterns. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The implementation aligns with typical polyfill patterns and does not perform any external communication or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for backward compatibility with no security risks or malicious intent. All signals indicate a safe, well-understood pattern with no obfuscation or malicious activity.",
