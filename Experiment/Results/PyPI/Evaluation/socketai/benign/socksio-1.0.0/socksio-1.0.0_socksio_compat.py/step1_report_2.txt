{
  "purpose": "Provide a backport implementation of functools.singledispatchmethod for Python versions earlier than 3.7, enabling single-dispatch method functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports from functools and typing modules; attribute checks for 'singledispatchmethod' in functools.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically defines a class for backporting functionality; no unusual code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behavior observed. The code carefully checks for existing implementations and provides fallback.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing standard modules and checking if 'singledispatchmethod' exists in functools. If it does, it assigns it directly; otherwise, it defines a class to mimic the behavior. The class constructor wraps a function with functools.singledispatch and provides a register method to associate types with functions. The __get__ method implements descriptor behavior to dispatch method calls based on the class of the first argument. No user input, external data, or network communication is present. The implementation relies solely on Python's standard library and standard language features, with proper type checks and method wrapping. Overall, the code appears to be a well-structured compatibility shim for older Python versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for backporting a Python feature, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs no external data handling, network activity, or system manipulation. The implementation is straightforward and adheres to typical Python idioms.",
