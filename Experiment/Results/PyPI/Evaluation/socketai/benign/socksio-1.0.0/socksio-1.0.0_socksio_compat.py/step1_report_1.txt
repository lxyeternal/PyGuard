{
  "purpose": "This code provides a backport implementation of functools.singledispatchmethod for Python versions earlier than 3.7, allowing method overloading based on argument types.",
  "sources": "The code reads input primarily from function definitions, attribute checks (hasattr), and method calls such as dispatch, register, and update_wrapper.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the dispatch method (which determines method execution), the register method (which adds new type handlers), and the dynamic method wrapper (_method). These could lead to dynamic behavior modification if misused.",
  "flows": "Input (function or class) -> __init__ or register method -> dispatcher.dispatch -> _method calls specific registered implementations -> method execution",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard implementation with no unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. The class implementation closely follows Python's functools patterns. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a fallback for singledispatchmethod, involving dynamic registration and method dispatch based on input argument types. It validates callables, wraps functions, and manages method dispatch via functools.singledispatch. No suspicious network operations, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. The use of update_wrapper and attribute checks are standard for decorator patterns. No signs of code injection, malicious data handling, or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a backport for singledispatchmethod, following standard patterns. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on its current structure.",
