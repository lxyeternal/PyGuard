  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Backport of `singledispatchmethod` for Python <3.7.\n- **Analysis:** The code checks for existing implementation; if absent, defines a class that wraps `functools.singledispatch`. It uses standard patterns: attribute checks, method registration, dispatching, and wrapper updates.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no external data, no network activity, no obfuscation. It’s a straightforward compatibility shim.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, emphasizing compatibility.\n- **Analysis:** The code is standard, with no external data handling or suspicious patterns. It conditionally defines the class if needed, uses standard Python idioms.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no external communication, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same, for older Python versions.\n- **Analysis:** Standard implementation, no signs of malicious behavior, no external data or network activity.\n- **Scores:** Both malware and risk are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Same, utility for method dispatching.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no external data, no obfuscation, straightforward implementation.\n- **Scores:** Both malware and security risk are 0, appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Same, for compatibility.\n- **Analysis:** No external data, no malicious patterns, standard dispatch pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk scores are 0, fitting the benign analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code is a compatibility utility implementing a backport of `singledispatchmethod`.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** None apparent; the code relies solely on standard library features and typical patterns.\n- **Functionality:** All reports agree on the benign, utility nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Justification:** The code is a standard, well-understood pattern for backward compatibility, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a compatibility layer.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.\n- Scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further detailed analysis or specific risk scoring adjustments.",
