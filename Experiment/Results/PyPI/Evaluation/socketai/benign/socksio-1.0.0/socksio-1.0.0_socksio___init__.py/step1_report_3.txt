{
  "purpose": "Define and export SOCKS protocol implementation classes and exceptions for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.exceptions, .socks4, .socks5). No external input data handling present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no processing or data transmission logic shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink flow present in the provided code; it is solely a module import and export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that imports specific classes and constants from internal submodules and then exposes them via __all__. It contains no data processing, no network operations, and no dynamic execution. It serves as a library interface definition. The code is minimal and standard for a Python package structure, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a clean, standard module interface setup for SOCKS protocol classes. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and appears to be designed for legitimate protocol implementation purposes.",
