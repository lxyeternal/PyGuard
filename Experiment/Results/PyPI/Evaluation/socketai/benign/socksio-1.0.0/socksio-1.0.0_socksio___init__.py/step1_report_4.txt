  "purpose": "Defines and exports classes and exceptions related to SOCKS4, SOCKS4A, and SOCKS5 protocols for a Sans-I/O implementation.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .exceptions, .socks4, and .socks5.",
  "sparks": "No explicit input reading; relies on imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is present in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "This code primarily imports classes and exceptions from local modules and then exports them via __all__. It serves as a public interface definition for a SOCKS protocol library. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network interactions are present in this snippet. The code structure appears standard and clean, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Since it depends on other modules for core logic, a full security assessment would require reviewing those modules. However, based on this file alone, there are no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module for exporting SOCKS protocol components with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears safe and standard for a Python package interface.",
