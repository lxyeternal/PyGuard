  "purpose": "Module initializer importing SOCKS protocol classes and exceptions, setting version and public API.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.exceptions, .socks4, .socks5).",
  "sinks": "No data input/output or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ definition; no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py pattern, importing classes and constants, defining __version__ and __all__. It contains no runtime logic, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It relies on internal modules which are not provided, but from this snippet alone, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a security risk score of 0, indicating no security concern.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
