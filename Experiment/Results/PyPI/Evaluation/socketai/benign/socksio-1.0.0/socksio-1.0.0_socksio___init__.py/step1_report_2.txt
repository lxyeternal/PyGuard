{
  "purpose": "This module provides implementations for SOCKS4, SOCKS4A, and SOCKS5 protocols, mainly for proxy server or client functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .exceptions, .socks4, and .socks5",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network operations, file writes, or command executions are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows are not explicitly shown; the code primarily imports and re-exports classes and constants, with no runtime data handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that imports specific classes and constants from internal submodules related to SOCKS protocol implementations. It sets up module exports via __all__, with no runtime logic, user input, or data processing present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The structure is typical for a Python package component focused on protocol implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign, standard module initializer for SOCKS protocol implementations, with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
