{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an import and export interface for SOCKS protocol implementations (SOCKS4, SOCKS4A, SOCKS5) for use in a larger application, providing versioning and module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.exceptions, .socks4, .socks5) and the assignment of version and __all__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing are present in this code snippet; it primarily imports and exposes classes and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling are present; this code only defines module structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are detected. The version string is standard. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and constants from internal modules related to SOCKS protocol implementations. It sets a version string and defines __all__ for module exports. There is no handling of user input, environment variables, or data that could introduce security risks. The structure is straightforward and standard for a Python module intended to organize and export functionality. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard organizational piece for a SOCKS protocol library, exporting classes and constants for external use. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks within this code. It appears safe and benign.",
