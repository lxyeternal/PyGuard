  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is a simple module initializer importing classes and setting exports. No runtime data handling, network operations, or obfuscation.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — accurate.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified, as there's no security concern here.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly notes that this is a straightforward import/export module with no active data processing or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** Sound analysis.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, a standard module initializer with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, noting no suspicious activity, with a slight mention of \"securityRisk\": 0.1.  \n- **Security Risk:** The small value (0.1) suggests minimal concern, but given the code's nature, this is acceptable.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is reasonable; the slight security risk score might reflect a generic caution but is not indicative of any actual threat.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as others, correctly describing the code as a benign module setup.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected. The code is purely structural, importing and exporting classes.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.  \n- **Risk scores:** All are appropriately low (0), with one report assigning a minimal security risk (0.1), which is acceptable given the context.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity is evident or implied.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — the code is a standard module initializer with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet and assign appropriate scores. No adjustments are necessary.",
