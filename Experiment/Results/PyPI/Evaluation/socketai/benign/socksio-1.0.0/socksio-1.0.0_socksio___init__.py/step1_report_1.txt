{
  "purpose": "To provide a Sans-I/O implementation of SOCKS4, SOCKS4A, and SOCKS5 protocols for proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.exceptions, .socks4, .socks5), version declaration, and __all__ list defining exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O within this fragment.",
  "flows": "No active data flow within this code snippet; it primarily imports classes and defines the module's public API.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The version string is static but harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer, importing necessary classes and exceptions from internal submodules, setting the version, and defining exports. There are no runtime data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard module setup for SOCKS protocol implementations, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this fragment.",
