{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for encoding, decoding, and parsing IP addresses and ports, mainly for SOCKS proxy communication.",
  "sources": "Reading input addresses as strings or bytes in functions encode_address, decode_address, and split_address_port_from_string; no external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write or transmit data; they perform encoding/decoding and parsing locally.",
  "flows": "Input addresses are processed and transformed into binary or string forms within encode_address and decode_address, with address parsing in split_address_port_from_string. No data flows to external systems or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. Regular expressions and address parsing follow standard practices. No suspicious imports or code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements address type determination, encoding, decoding, and parsing of address strings with ports. Uses regex for IPv6 parsing, standard socket functions for IP conversions, and caching for performance. No external data or network activity occurs. Functions operate solely on provided data with no side effects. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for handling network addresses in a SOCKS proxy context. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks within this code fragment.",
