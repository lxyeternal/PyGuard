  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a utility module for address parsing, encoding, and decoding, primarily for SOCKS proxy communication.\n- It uses standard Python modules (enum, functools, re, socket) and performs typical address handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The functions process data locally, with no external network activity or data exfiltration.\n- The regex and socket functions are standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes minimal security risk (0.2), malware score 0, obfuscated 0, confidence 0.9.\n- **Logic:** Correctly identifies that the code is standard, safe, and does not contain malicious patterns.\n- **Verdict:** The score aligns with the analysis; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, with a confidence of 1.0 and no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Logic:** Correctly notes that the code is standard, safe, and performs address parsing without malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, with a confidence of 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n- **Logic:** Again, no signs of malicious activity; the code is typical for address handling.\n- **Verdict:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern, confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.\n- **Logic:** No suspicious behavior or malicious patterns detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Similar, confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n- **Logic:** The functions are standard, safe, and well-understood.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk:** Slight variation, but all are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, well-implemented utility for address handling.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores across reports are consistent and justified.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to handling untrusted input, but the code itself is safe)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
