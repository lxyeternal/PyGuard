{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for handling IP addresses and ports, including encoding, decoding, and parsing address strings for SOCKS proxy communication.",
  "sources": "Input address strings (bytes or str) for encoding/decoding; address strings with ports for splitting.",
  "sinks": "None; functions process data locally without executing untrusted code or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input address data flows through parsing functions to determine address type, encode, or decode, and extract address-port tuples.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard libraries, straightforward regex, and socket functions without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard address handling tasks with proper validation and safe socket operations. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The functions handle untrusted input safely, with no dynamic code execution or data exfiltration. Caching improves performance but does not introduce security issues. The regex and socket functions are correctly implemented and standard. Overall, the code is a benign utility module for network address processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for address parsing, encoding, and decoding, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk=0.1-0.2) are accurate and justified based on the code's straightforward and safe nature.",
