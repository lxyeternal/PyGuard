{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for handling network addresses, including encoding/decoding and parsing address strings with ports, primarily for use with SOCKS proxies.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user-provided address strings or bytes, and possibly external modules such as socksio.socks5 for address type determination.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include socket functions (inet_pton, inet_ntop) and data encoding/decoding, which handle IP addresses and domain names.",
  "flows": "Input address or bytes → address parsing or type determination → encoding/decoding IP addresses or returning strings → parsing address with port → converting to tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. Use of regex and socket functions is standard. No obfuscated code present. No suspicious network activity or data leakage points are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly performs address parsing, encoding, and decoding, utilizing standard Python libraries. The regex matches IPv6 addresses with ports, and functions encode/decode addresses for SOCKS proxy compatibility. The use of functools.lru_cache optimizes repeated address encoding/decoding but does not introduce security issues. No external inputs are mishandled; data is processed securely. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or harmful side effects. The code is well-structured, with clear purpose, and uses safe socket functions. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard utility for handling network addresses with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely manages address parsing, encoding, and decoding with no suspicious features.",
