  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'socksio' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads package information, metadata, and package data from predefined variables and input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Calls the setup() function from distutils.core to initiate packaging; no untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded package metadata into setup() to generate package distributions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard setup script generated by a packaging tool.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup from distutils.core, defines package and package data variables, and calls setup() with static package metadata. It does not process external inputs or untrusted data. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. It is a typical package setup script, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious behaviors embedded.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging the 'socksio' library. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, benign build configuration.",
