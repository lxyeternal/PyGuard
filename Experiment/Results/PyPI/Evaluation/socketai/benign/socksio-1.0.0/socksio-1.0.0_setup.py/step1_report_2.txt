  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'socksio' Python library, used for distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata such as name, version, description, author info, URL, packages, and package data.",
  "sinks": "None; the script does not process untrusted input or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script merely supplies static package configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard setup configuration without obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py generated by 'flit' with minimal code, importing only distutils for package setup. It defines package metadata and data for distribution. No user input, network activity, or runtime code execution occurs. The structure and content are typical for package setup files, with no suspicious patterns or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py file is benign, standard packaging code with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It is a straightforward package configuration script.",
