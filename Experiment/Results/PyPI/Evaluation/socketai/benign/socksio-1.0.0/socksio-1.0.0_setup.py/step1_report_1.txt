  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'socksio' package, used to install the package and its metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads package list, package data, and metadata from hardcoded variables; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "Uses distutils.setup() to process installation; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; static configuration is used to invoke setup.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; standard setup script generated by 'flit', with no obfuscation, code injection, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration file, generated by a packaging tool (flit). It imports only standard modules (distutils) and defines package metadata explicitly. There are no dynamic code execution, user inputs, or network calls. The package data and configuration appear straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It merely provides package metadata and configuration for installation.",
