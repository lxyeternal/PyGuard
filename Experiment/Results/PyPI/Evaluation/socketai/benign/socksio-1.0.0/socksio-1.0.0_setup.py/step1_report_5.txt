  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'socksio' Python package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Constants and string literals defining package metadata (name, version, description, author, URL).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data processing or network operations are performed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script only calls setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file generated by 'flit' for packaging. It imports 'distutils.core.setup', defines package information statically, and calls setup() with fixed arguments. There are no inputs, no code execution based on external data, and no suspicious code behavior. The package description and metadata do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
