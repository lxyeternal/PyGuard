{
  "purpose": "Automates code quality checks, testing, and documentation tasks for the Python project using standard tools (nox, autoflake, black, flake8, isort, mypy, sphinx).",
  "sources": "Reads source files and configuration files; invokes external tools with fixed parameters; no untrusted input or dynamic data processing.",
  "sinks": "External command executions for code formatting, linting, testing, and documentation generation; no data leaks or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Source files are processed by formatting and linting tools; testing is run on local code; no untrusted data flows to external systems or over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors identified; standard use of well-known tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical automation setup for project maintenance, invoking standard tools with predefined parameters on local source files. No dynamic input, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. All external tools are used in a benign manner, and no obfuscation or malicious code patterns are detected. The structure and commands are consistent with common CI/CD practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard automation configuration for code quality, testing, and documentation. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
