  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS4A request and reply handling, including serialization, deserialization, and validation according to protocol standards.",
  "sources": "Address input in from_address methods, user_id in dumps methods, data received in receive_data method.",
  "sinks": "Data sent via data_to_send method, untrusted data processed in loads method, request dumps output.",
  "flows": "Address input -> encode_address -> request creation -> dumps -> data buffer; received data -> accumulate -> loads -> reply object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Address validation enforces IPv4 only for SOCKS4, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, protocol-compliant implementation of SOCKS4/SOCKS4A request and reply handling. It performs proper validation, error handling, and data packing/unpacking. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. External functions for address encoding are assumed secure and standard. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious logic. The validation ensures only IPv4 addresses are used for SOCKS4 requests, aligning with protocol specs. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and protocol-compliant implementation with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). The reports' assessments are consistent and justified.",
