{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures and methods for constructing, sending, and receiving SOCKS4/SOCKS4A proxy requests and responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function arguments, class attributes, and external modules (e.g., get_address_port_tuple_from_address, decode_address).",
  "sinks": "Data sent through the dumps() methods, network transmission of request and reply bytes, and the internal buffer concatenations.",
  "flows": "Input data (addresses, user IDs) -> encoding in request objects -> dumps() serialization -> sending over network -> receiving raw bytes -> loads() deserialization -> reply objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious commands, or obfuscated code. The code handles socket request/response encapsulation securely and straightforwardly.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages SOCKS4/SOCKS4A request and reply data serialization/deserialization with proper validation and exception handling. It uses standard enum and namedtuple for clarity. There is no evidence of malicious payloads or data leakage mechanisms. No external or hidden network activities are embedded within the code. It relies on external modules for address encoding/decoding, which appears standard. The buffers are managed appropriately, and data validation checks are present. Overall, the code functions as a proxy protocol implementation without suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This module implements SOCKS4/SOCKS4A protocol request and response handling in a clear and standard manner. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage within this code. It appears to be a legitimate, protocol-compliant component. Due to the straightforward nature and absence of suspicious code, the malware likelihood is very low.",
