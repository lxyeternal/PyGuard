  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS4A proxy request and response handling, including request creation, serialization, and reply parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily read from address parameters, user_id parameters, and raw bytes from network responses.",
  "sinks": "Data serialization (dumps methods), network transmission buffers, reply parsing functions.",
  "flows": "Address inputs -> encode_address -> dumps methods -> network send buffers -> receive_data appends raw data -> SOCKS4Reply.loads -> reply object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network addresses, and no unusual code behaviors are evident. The code handles address encoding, request packing, and response parsing in standard ways without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation for SOCKS4/4A protocol requests and responses. It includes address validation, serialization of request data, and reply parsing. No suspicious data handling, external network calls, or hidden mechanisms are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are observed. Functions perform expected operations: converting addresses, packing data, and parsing responses. The methods appropriately raise errors on malformed data. Overall, the code appears to be a typical, well-structured protocol handling library with no malicious or maliciously intended behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of SOCKS4/4A request and response handling. It does not exhibit any signs of malicious intent or security risks. There are no hidden backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious network behaviors. The code is safe for use within a network proxy context.",
