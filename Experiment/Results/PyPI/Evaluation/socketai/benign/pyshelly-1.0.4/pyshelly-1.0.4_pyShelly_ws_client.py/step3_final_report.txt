{
  "purpose": "A WebSocket client managing device communication, handling connection, message exchange, and retries.",
  "sources": "Reads device IP from self.block.ip_addr, uses websocket library to connect, and processes incoming messages.",
  "sinks": "Uses self.ws.send() to send messages; processes incoming JSON messages to update device status.",
  "flows": "Source: self.block.ip_addr; Sink: self.ws.send() and update_rpc() via message callbacks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious external calls, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard threading and UUID usage.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard WebSocket client for device communication, with connection retries, threading, and message handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. No external malicious domains or secrets are present. The use of threading and dynamic IP addresses is typical for such applications. The code relies on external data (self.block) which, if compromised, could be misused, but this is outside the code's scope. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard WebSocket client managing device communication. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and risk score (0.2) are appropriate given its functionality.",
