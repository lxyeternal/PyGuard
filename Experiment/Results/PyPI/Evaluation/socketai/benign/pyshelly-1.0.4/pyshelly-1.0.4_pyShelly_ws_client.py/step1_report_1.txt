{
  "purpose": "This code manages WebSocket connections to devices, handling connection lifecycle, messaging, and error logging.",
  "sources": "Reads IP address from self.block.ip_addr, receives messages via WebSocket on_message callback, and calls self.block.update_rpc with incoming data.",
  "sinks": "Uses self.ws.send() to send messages, which could potentially send untrusted data if self.block data is malicious, and logs errors via error_log.",
  "flows": "Upon WebSocket message receipt, data is processed and passed to self.block.update_rpc. Connection management functions initiate or close connections based on internal state and timing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external communications observed. The code dynamically manages WebSocket connections with retries and threading, but no malicious code behavior is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard WebSocket client logic, including connection handling, message processing, and threading. It does not contain obfuscated code, suspicious API calls, or external data leaks. The use of threading and dynamic connection management appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious intent. Error logging is performed, but no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical WebSocket client implementation for device communication. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this module. It handles connections and messaging in a standard manner with no suspicious activity.",
