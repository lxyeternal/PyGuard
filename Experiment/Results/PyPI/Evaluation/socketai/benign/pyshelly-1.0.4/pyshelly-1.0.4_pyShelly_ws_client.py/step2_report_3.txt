  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard WebSocket client managing device communication, with connection handling, message processing, and error logging.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- No suspicious external domains, payloads, or malicious network activity.\n- Use of threading and UUIDs appears legitimate.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious control flow.\n- The code appears to be part of a device management system, possibly for Shelly devices, but nothing malicious is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Specific report review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate; manages WebSocket lifecycle, processes messages, updates device status.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **malware:** 0 (appropriate)  \n  - **obfuscated:** 0 (appropriate)  \n  - **securityRisk:** 0.2 (low, due to standard network communication)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct; handles WebSocket connection, message receipt, status update.\n- **Anomalies:** None; URL construction is standard, no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious intent, no obfuscation, standard device communication.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **malware:** 0 (appropriate)  \n  - **obfuscated:** 0 (appropriate)  \n  - **securityRisk:** 0.2 (appropriate)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate; manages device communication via WebSocket.\n- **Anomalies:** None; straightforward implementation.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **malware:** 0  \n  - **obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **securityRisk:** 0.2  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct; handles connection, messaging, status.\n- **Anomalies:** None; standard patterns.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **malware:** 0  \n  - **obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **securityRisk:** 0.2  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct; WebSocket connection management.\n- **Anomalies:** None; standard reconnection logic.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **malware:** 0  \n  - **obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **securityRisk:** 0.2  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity or payloads are evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** The 0.2 scores reflect a low but non-zero risk, considering network communication and threading, which is reasonable.\n\n### **Potential adjustments:**\n\n- Given the analysis, **no changes** to scores are necessary.\n- The code is standard, well-structured, and shows no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (low, due to network communication, threading, and device management, but no evident security issues)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports' scoring aligns well with the code's actual content. No modifications are recommended. The code appears to be a legitimate WebSocket client for device communication with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
