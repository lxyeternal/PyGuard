  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured IoT device management system with no malicious or sabotage intent. It does not contain obfuscated code or malicious payloads. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, primarily due to broad exception handling and network exposure typical of IoT systems. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. Overall, the code appears safe and free of malicious activity."
