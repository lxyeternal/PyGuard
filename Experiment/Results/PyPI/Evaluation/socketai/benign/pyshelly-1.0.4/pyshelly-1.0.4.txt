The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, primarily due to broad exception handling and network exposure typical of IoT systems. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. Overall, the code appears safe and free of malicious activity."

The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal risk primarily due to debug mode being active. The assessments in the critical reports are accurate and justified."
