  "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It functions as a standard device data handler. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal risk primarily due to debug mode being active. The assessments in the critical reports are accurate and justified."
