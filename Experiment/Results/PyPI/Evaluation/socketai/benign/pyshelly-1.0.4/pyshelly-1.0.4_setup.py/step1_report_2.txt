  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration script for packaging the pyShelly library, including reading version info and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, reading version from a file, checking Python version to determine dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data directly used in critical sinks such as network, file, or environment variables that could lead to data leakage or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> extracting version info -> setting up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard setup script with version extraction via regex, conditional dependency inclusion based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks for a Python package. It reads files for description and version info, uses regex for version extraction, and sets dependencies based on the Python version. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or use of untrusted inputs that could lead to security issues. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python packaging script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for the pyShelly package.",
