{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package, reading static files for metadata, extracting version info via regex, and setting dependencies based on Python version.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md and pyShelly/const.py files, uses regex to extract version string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static file reading and regex parsing are used without handling untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads files and extracts version info; no dynamic or untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with straightforward file reading, regex version extraction, and conditional dependencies. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. The regex for version extraction is standard, and the overall structure is conventional. No malicious or security-compromising patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All signals indicate a benign, well-structured configuration.",
