{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package 'pyShelly' that reads package information and dependencies to prepare for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, reading version from 'pyShelly/const.py', and checking Python version info from sys module.",
  "sinks": "None of the sources directly feed untrusted data into sinks; the code primarily reads static files and system info.",
  "flows": "The version string is extracted from a static file and assigned for package setup; dependencies are set based on Python version.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. The code uses standard libraries and well-known package setup routines.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: reading files, parsing version info, setting dependencies based on Python version, and configuring package metadata. All operations involve static or system information without handling untrusted input or executing external commands. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and standard in structure.",
