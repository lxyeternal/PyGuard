  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code and the reasoning.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a typical Python package setup script.\n- It reads static files ('README.md', 'pyShelly/const.py') to extract metadata.\n- It conditionally sets dependencies based on Python version.\n- It uses regex to extract the version string, which is a common practice.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input processing is evident.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script's purpose and sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks; static file reading and regex parsing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code; standard regex for version extraction.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate; code appears safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard setup routines.\n- Correctly notes no untrusted data or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-reasoned; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n\n- Slightly different in wording but similar conclusions.\n- Mentions reading version from 'pyShelly/const.py' (the code reads from 'pyShelly/const.py', which is consistent).\n- Notes no dynamic code execution or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the small non-zero securityRisk score seems to be an overestimation, as the code is static and safe.\n\n**Recommendation:** The securityRisk score should be 0, not 0.1, since no risky operations are present.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n\n- Correctly identifies the script as standard setup code.\n- Emphasizes no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n\n- Similar to others; notes no suspicious activity.\n- Correctly states the code is a typical setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Most reports assign 0; Report 3 assigns 0.1, which seems unjustified given the static, safe nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at 0 across all reports.\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Security risk score:** Should be 0 for all reports, as no risky operations are present.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — static, well-understood setup script with no dangerous operations.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe setup script with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores in the reports are generally appropriate, except for a minor overestimation of the security risk in report 3.\n\n**Final note:** All reports are consistent with the code's actual behavior, and no modifications are necessary beyond adjusting the small security risk in report 3 to 0.",
