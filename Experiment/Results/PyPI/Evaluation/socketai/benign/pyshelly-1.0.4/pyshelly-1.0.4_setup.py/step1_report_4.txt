{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'pyShelly' by reading metadata, dependencies, and version info, preparing it for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, reads files to find version string, checks Python version to determine dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None of the source inputs are directly used in a way that could lead to data leakage or untrusted code execution. No network, file, or environment variable manipulations are performed with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> store in LONG_DESCRIPTION; read version file -> extract version -> set up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. Usage of regular expressions and file I/O is straightforward and safe. The only notable aspect is dynamic version extraction, which is common.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package setup, reading files, and configuring dependencies and metadata. It uses standard Python libraries and functions with no evidence of malicious behavior or backdoors. The version extraction via regex is standard, and dependency selection depends on Python version. No network calls, no credential handling, no code injection, and no suspicious file manipulations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates within expected boundaries for package configuration and distribution.",
