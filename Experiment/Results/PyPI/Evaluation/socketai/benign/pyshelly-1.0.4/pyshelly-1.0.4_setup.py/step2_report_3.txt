  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- It reads static files (README.md, const.py) to extract metadata.\n- It conditionally sets dependencies based on Python version.\n- It uses regex to extract the version string.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input beyond file reading.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code appears free of malicious behavior.\n- No malware, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- The logic is straightforward and standard for package setup.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The version extraction uses regex, which is common, but it assumes the version string is formatted as `VERSION = '...'` in `pyShelly/const.py`. If the file is untrusted or modified maliciously, it could potentially cause issues, but as-is, it's standard.\n- Dependencies are set based on Python version, which is normal.\n- No untrusted data sinks or data flows that could lead to security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Review of reports:\n\n**Report 1 & 2 & 4 & 5:**\n- All conclude that the script is standard, safe, and free of malicious behavior.\n- They assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the nature of the code.\n- Their confidence levels are high (1), which is appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Assigns a securityRisk score of 0.1, which is slightly higher but still low, considering the static file reads and regex usage.\n- All other scores are zero or near zero, aligning with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Score justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious intent; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear, with no obfuscation; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's purpose and behavior, a low risk score (around 0.0 to 0.1) is justified.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- The only minor point is the regex-based version extraction, which could be a point of failure if the file is maliciously altered. However, this does not constitute a security risk, just a robustness concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to account for potential issues if files are maliciously altered, but overall very low risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a typical, benign setup script with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned by reports are consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects the code's standard nature and negligible security risk, with a slight margin for potential issues if external files are compromised.",
