  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The script is a typical `setup.py` for a Python package.\n- Reads static files (`README.md`, `pyShelly/const.py`) to extract metadata and version.\n- Uses regex to parse the version string.\n- Sets dependencies conditionally based on Python version.\n- Does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data.\n- Contains no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The version extraction via regex is standard practice.\n- No code execution of untrusted input or external commands.\n- No network activity or environment variable manipulation.\n- No obfuscated code or backdoors.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, standard, and trustworthy.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All describe the code as a standard setup script.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns identified.\n- No untrusted data processing or security risks.\n- The only minor point is the regex for version extraction, which is common and safe here.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**Potential inconsistencies:**\n- The third report assigns a `securityRisk` score of 0.1, which seems slightly elevated given the lack of any real security concern. Possibly a conservative default, but it should be 0.\n- The fourth report assigns a `securityRisk` of 0, which aligns better with the actual code.\n\n---\n\n### Malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports give 0, which is accurate. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All give 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any security issues, the risk score should be 0 across the board.\n\n**Note:** The reports' scores are mostly reasonable, but the third report's `securityRisk` of 0.1 is slightly overestimating the risk, given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Score Type     | Reasoning                                              | Recommended Value |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Malware        | No malicious activity, code is straightforward.       | **0**           |\n| Obfuscated     | Clear, readable code, no obfuscation.                | **0**           |\n| Risk           | No security issues, no untrusted input or code execution. | **0**           |\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe setup script with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are generally appropriate, with minor overestimation of risk in one report.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Risk score: **0**\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
