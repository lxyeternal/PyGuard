  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing their conclusions with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No untrusted input processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code reads static files (README.md, const.py) to extract metadata.\n- Version extraction uses a regex, which is standard practice.\n- Dependencies are conditionally set based on Python version.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code structure and logic are typical for a package setup script.\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n\n- Malware: 0 in all reports, consistent with no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated: 0 in all reports, as no obfuscation is evident.\n- Security risk: mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1, which seems overly cautious given the analysis.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n\n- The code does not execute untrusted code, nor does it process untrusted input.\n- The regex for version extraction is straightforward.\n- Dependency setting based on Python version is standard.\n- No network activity, environment variable manipulation, or other risky behaviors.\n\n**Potential points of contention:**\n\n- The report assigning a security risk of 0.1 (Report 3) may be overly cautious. The code does not handle untrusted input or perform operations that could lead to security issues.\n- All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score should be 0, reflecting the absence of vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate, but the minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report should be adjusted to 0 for consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the consensus of the reports.",
