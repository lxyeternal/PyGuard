{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, reading version info from a file.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no data is sent or executed unsafely.",
  "flows": "Read README.md -> define package metadata -> setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files for description and version, sets dependencies based on Python version, and calls setuptools.setup with package info. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or suspicious logic detected. The use of regex to find version is standard. The dependencies are standard packages. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
