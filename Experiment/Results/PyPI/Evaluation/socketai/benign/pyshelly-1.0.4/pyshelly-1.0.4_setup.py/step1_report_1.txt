  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging the 'pyShelly' Python library, including reading version info and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading files ('README.md', version file 'pyShelly/const.py'), obtaining environment info (Python version).",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or processes untrusted input in a way that leads to data leaks or security effects. No untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> extracting version string; checking Python version -> setting dependencies; passing configuration to setuptools.setup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. Use of regular expressions for version extraction is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads static files to gather package metadata and configures setup parameters. It conditionally sets dependencies based on Python version. No execution of untrusted code, network activity, or manipulation of environment variables that could pose security risks. The code structure and content are typical for a Python package setup script, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code appears safe and trustworthy.",
