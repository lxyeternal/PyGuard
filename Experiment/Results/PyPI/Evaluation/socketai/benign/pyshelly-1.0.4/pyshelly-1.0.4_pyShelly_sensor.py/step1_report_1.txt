{
  "purpose": "Define various sensor classes for a device management system, representing different sensor types such as motion, temperature, humidity, flood, smoke, door/window, and gas sensors.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.device, .const), constructor parameters, class attributes, method inputs (e.g., payloads, status, values).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly observed; no system calls, network operations, file writes, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "Constructor parameters initialize class attributes; format functions convert values; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Commented-out code is benign. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variables observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple sensor classes inheriting from a base Sensor class, with specific configurations per sensor type. The format method converts input to float or boolean based on value. No network operations, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident. The class attributes and methods focus solely on data representation and formatting. Use of class attributes and constructor parameters appears standard and safe. No anomalous or malicious constructs identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured sensor class hierarchy with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs data formatting and class initialization without external side effects or sensitive data handling.",
