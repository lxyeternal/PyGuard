  "purpose": "Set up and configure the 'free_proxy' Python package for distribution",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; package setup parameters",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data output or network transmission in this code",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setup configuration",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup of a Python package using setuptools. It reads a local README.md file for the long description, then configures package metadata including name, version, author, description, URL, packages, classifiers, Python version requirement, and dependencies. All operations are standard for package distribution; no network activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
