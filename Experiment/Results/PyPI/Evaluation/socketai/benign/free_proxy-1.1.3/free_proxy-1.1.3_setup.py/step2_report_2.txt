  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Python package setup script.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity is detected.\n- The code reads a local README.md file and calls `setuptools.setup()` with package metadata.\n- No network activity, data leakage, or external data processing beyond static file reading.\n- Dependencies (`lxml`, `requests`) are common and not inherently malicious, though they could be misused if the package itself contained malicious code, which is not indicated here.\n\n**Specific analysis:**\n\n### Report 1\n- **Score: malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0**\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The confidence is high (1.0). No issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Score: malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0**\n- **Justification:** Same as above; the analysis correctly identifies this as a benign setup script.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Score: malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0**\n- **Justification:** Again, the assessment aligns with the previous reports. No suspicious activity.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Score: malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0**\n- **Justification:** The review confirms a standard, safe setup script with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Score: malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0**\n- **Justification:** Consistent with others; no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code, a risk score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** 0, as there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** High, since all reports concur.\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n- The reports are accurate; the code is a typical setup script with no security concerns.\n- No changes needed in the scoring or analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is benign, standard packaging boilerplate, and poses no security threat.",
