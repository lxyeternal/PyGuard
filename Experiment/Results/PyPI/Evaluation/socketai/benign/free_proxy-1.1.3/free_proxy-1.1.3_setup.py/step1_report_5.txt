  "purpose": "Set up and configure the 'free_proxy' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setuptools for package setup; no other data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data is processed or output beyond package setup.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script only performs static setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward setup script with standard use of setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and reads a local README.md file to set up package metadata. It specifies package information, dependencies, and metadata fields in a standard manner. No user input, network operations, or untrusted data handling is involved. The code does not include any malicious constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. It simply performs a typical package configuration for distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The code's purpose is to facilitate package installation and distribution.",
