  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'free_proxy' Python package, providing package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; static package setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; no code execution or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to critical functions or external outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools, reading a README file for long description, and defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It contains no dynamic code, external data processing beyond static file reading, or network activity. The script appears typical for Python package distribution and does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign and standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
