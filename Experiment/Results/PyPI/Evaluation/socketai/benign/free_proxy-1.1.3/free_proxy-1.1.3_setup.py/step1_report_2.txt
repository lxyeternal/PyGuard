{
  "purpose": "The code is configuring the setup process for a Python package named 'free_proxy' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads from 'README.md' to obtain the long description; it also specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; package metadata and dependencies are specified statically.",
  "flows": "The code reads the README file to gather description data, then proceeds to set up package metadata and dependencies, with no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious code constructs detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a description file and specifies package info and dependencies. There are no suspicious or malicious elements, and no external data is being processed dynamically that could pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks based on the provided content.",
