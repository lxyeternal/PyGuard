  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools for 'free_proxy'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> Call setuptools.setup() with static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a local file and calls setuptools.setup() with static, benign metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. Dependencies are common and not suspicious. All five reports concur that the code is benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and appropriate.",
