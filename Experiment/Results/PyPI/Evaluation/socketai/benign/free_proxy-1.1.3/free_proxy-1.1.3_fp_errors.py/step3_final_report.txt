  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for the FreeProxy module to handle specific error cases.",
  "sources": "The class accepts a message parameter during initialization.",
  "sinks": "The message parameter is stored in self.message and passed to the superclass; no external data sources or untrusted inputs are involved.",
  "flows": "Input message flows from constructor parameter to self.message and super().__init__, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward class definition with standard exception handling pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with an __init__ method that assigns the message to an instance variable and passes it to the superclass. There are no external inputs, network operations, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. The code's simplicity and standard pattern confirm its benign nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present, and the code is unlikely to be involved in supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
