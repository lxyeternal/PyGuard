  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling exceptions related to the FreeProxy module.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behavior observed. The class is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class 'FreeProxyException' inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. It includes an __init__ method that assigns a message to an instance variable and calls the superclass constructor. There is no input reading, no external data handling, no dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious patterns. The class appears to be a typical custom exception intended for use within the FreeProxy module to handle specific errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign class definition for a custom exception. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions as a standard exception class with no harmful intent.",
