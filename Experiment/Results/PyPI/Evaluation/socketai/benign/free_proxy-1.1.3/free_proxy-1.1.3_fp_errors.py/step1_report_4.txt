{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors related to the FreeProxy module.",
  "sources": "The code does not read any external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as there are no data inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very straightforward, defining an exception class. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Python's Exception. It initializes with a message parameter and passes this message to the superclass. There are no external data inputs, no processing of untrusted data, and no side effects or network activity. The class appears to serve as a simple error handling mechanism within a larger codebase. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a custom exception class with no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears safe and unrelated to any security threats.",
