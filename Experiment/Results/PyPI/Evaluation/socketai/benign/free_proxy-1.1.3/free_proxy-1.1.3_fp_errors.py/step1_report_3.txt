  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling proxy-related errors with a message parameter.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted data or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class simply defines an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; straightforward class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with an __init__ method that stores a message and calls the superclass constructor. There are no input sources, no untrusted data handling, no data flows, and no suspicious or malicious code behavior. The class appears to be a simple, legitimate custom exception implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic, benign exception class definition with no malicious intent or security risks.",
