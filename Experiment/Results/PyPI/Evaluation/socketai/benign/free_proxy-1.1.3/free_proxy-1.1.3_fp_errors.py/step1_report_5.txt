{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors related to FreeProxy functionality",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not output data or handle untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as no input or output operations are present",
  "anomalies": "The class is straightforward, with no suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a simple custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with an __init__ method that sets a message attribute and calls the superclass constructor. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive operations. The implementation is standard for defining a custom exception in Python, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign custom exception class with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
