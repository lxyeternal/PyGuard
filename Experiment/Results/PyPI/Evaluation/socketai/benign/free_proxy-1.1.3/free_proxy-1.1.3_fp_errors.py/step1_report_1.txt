  "sinks": "None; the code does not write output or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward class definition with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with a constructor that sets a message attribute and calls the superclass constructor. There are no external inputs, network operations, or other behaviors that could be malicious. The code appears to be a simple, well-formed class definition with no obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
