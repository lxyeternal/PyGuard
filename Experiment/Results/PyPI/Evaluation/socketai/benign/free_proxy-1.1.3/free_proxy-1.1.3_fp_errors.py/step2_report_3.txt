  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review**:\n   - The code defines a single class `FreeProxyException` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - The constructor accepts a `message` parameter, assigns it to `self.message`, and calls `super().__init__(self.message)`.\n   - There are no external inputs, no data flows, no network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The class appears to be a straightforward custom exception class.\n\n2. **Report Analysis**:\n   - All five reports agree that the code is a simple, benign class definition.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n   - The reports consistently conclude the code is safe, with no security risks.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no security threat.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Misinterpretations**:\n   - Since the code is a basic exception class, there are no vulnerabilities or malicious activities.\n   - The detailed analysis confirms that the code does not perform any malicious or risky operations.\n   - The scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a standard, well-formed custom exception class.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe code is entirely benign and poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a straightforward custom exception class with no malicious intent.\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate** aligns with the reports:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0",
