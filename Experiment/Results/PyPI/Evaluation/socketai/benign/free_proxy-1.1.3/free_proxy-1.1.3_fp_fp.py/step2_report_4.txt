  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided assessments.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code's purpose is to scrape proxy lists from public sources, filter based on criteria, and verify proxies by making network requests through them.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code uses standard libraries (`requests`, `lxml`) and performs typical proxy validation techniques.\n- The main potential concern is the use of proxies in network requests, which inherently carries risks if proxies are malicious, but this is a known aspect of proxy tools, not an indicator of malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; proxy scraping and validation.\n- **Logic & Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Low security risk, malware score 0.\n- **Score Justification:** The report's securityRisk (0.2) and malware (0) are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; standard proxy scraper.\n- **Logic & Anomalies:** No malicious patterns, no backdoors, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, malware score 0.\n- **Score Justification:** Consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; straightforward proxy retrieval and validation.\n- **Logic & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score remains 0; security risk low.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Logic & Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0, security risk low.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Logic & Anomalies:** No malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard proxy scraper with inherent risks due to proxy trustworthiness, but no malicious code.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.2 seems reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. No malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.2), reflecting inherent risks in proxy usage but not maliciousness.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — confirmed no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3, considering the nature of proxy tools and potential misuse, but not due to malicious code.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code and reports indicate a benign proxy scraper and validator with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.",
