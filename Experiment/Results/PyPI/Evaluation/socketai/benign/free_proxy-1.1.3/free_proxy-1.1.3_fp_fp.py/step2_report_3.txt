  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Purpose: Scrapes proxy lists from multiple websites, filters proxies based on criteria (country, anonymity, HTTPS), and verifies their functionality by attempting network requests through them.\n- Data sources: External websites via HTTP requests.\n- Sinks: Network requests using proxies, primarily for validation.\n- Behavior: Fetch proxy list → parse HTML → filter → test proxies → return working proxy.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code identified.\n- Uses standard libraries (`requests`, `lxml`) and typical techniques.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose and sources are accurately described.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Low security risk, no malware.\n- Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent description.\n- No malicious indicators.\n- Conclusion: Low risk, no malware.\n- Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern; confirms legitimate proxy scraping.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Low risk, no malware.\n- Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, consistent with previous reports.\n- No suspicious behavior or code.\n- Conclusion: Low risk, no malware.\n- Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar analysis.\n- No malicious intent or code.\n- Conclusion: Low risk, no malware.\n- Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking the code with the reports:\n- The code's logic is straightforward: fetch, parse, filter, test proxies.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n- Uses external libraries in a standard way.\n- Proxy testing involves verifying the IP matches the proxy IP, a common method.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature and standard functionality, a low risk score is appropriate, around **0.2**.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- The only potential concern is reliance on proxies, which could be malicious if the proxies themselves are malicious. However, this is inherent in proxy usage, not the code itself.\n- No assumptions or suspicious behaviors are evident in the code or reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard proxy scraper and validator with no malicious intent or behavior. The risk is minimal, primarily related to the trustworthiness of external proxies, which is outside the scope of the code itself.\n\n**Final note:** The current scores in the reports align well with this assessment. No adjustments are necessary.",
