{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to scrape proxy server information from various websites, filter proxies based on certain criteria, and test their functionality by checking if they are working proxies.",
  "sources": "Requests to proxy list websites (e.g., free-proxy-list.net, us-proxy.org, sslproxies.org) for proxy data; environment variables or external input for parameters; requests to user-specified URL for proxy testing.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external websites for proxy validation; data flow through proxy configurations; potential network communications during proxy validation.",
  "flows": "Fetching proxy list from specific websites -> parsing HTML content -> filtering proxies based on criteria -> selecting a proxy -> testing the proxy by making a request to a specified URL -> returning a working proxy if found.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of requests library for network requests is standard; no obfuscated code or unusual language features. The code dynamically constructs proxies and evaluates their validity; no suspicious or malicious code paths evident.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves proxy data from publicly available proxy listing websites, parses the HTML to extract proxy IPs and ports, applies filtering criteria such as country, anonymity level, and HTTPS support, and tests proxies by making HTTP requests through them. The process appears straightforward and intended solely for proxy retrieval and validation. There are no indicators of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The use of requests for network communication is typical, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present. The code does not send data to unknown or malicious domains, nor does it execute any harmful commands.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a proxy scraper and validator, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code inclusion. It operates within typical parameters for such a tool, with no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is low.",
