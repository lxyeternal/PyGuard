  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input handling, environment variables, network/file operations, dynamic execution points (eval/exec), third-party libraries.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points, dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Input or environment data flows into execution or network communication functions without proper validation, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or malicious code patterns; code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets and descriptions indicate standard, non-obfuscated code with no signs of malicious intent. The lack of suspicious network activity, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution reduces concern. Confidence levels are high (0.7-0.9), and malware scores are consistently zero. Risk scores are low (0.2-0.3), reflecting minimal threat. The assessments are coherent and align with the evidence, with no significant anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no detectable malicious behavior or obfuscation. The supply chain security posture is strong, and the current scores accurately reflect the low risk. Minor adjustments to risk scores could be made for increased confidence, but overall, the assessments are appropriate.",
