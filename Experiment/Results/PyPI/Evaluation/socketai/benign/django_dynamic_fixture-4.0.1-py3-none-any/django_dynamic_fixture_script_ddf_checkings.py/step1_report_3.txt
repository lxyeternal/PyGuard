{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test and generate reports on Django models' ability to be instantiated using django_dynamic_fixture, including optional CSV output.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function parameters for application labels, exclusion lists, and file names. External data input occurs via function parameters, and file writing occurs in save_csv.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include file writing in save_csv and printing to console. No untrusted input flows into unsafe code or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through model instantiation attempts, into success/error dictionaries, then to report outputs (console or CSV file).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected. Use of try-except is standard for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs model instantiation testing within a transaction, capturing exceptions for reporting. It uses external Django libraries for model handling. Reports are generated for success and errors, optionally saving CSV files. No suspicious or malicious code is present; no network operations, reverse shells, or data exfiltration detected. File I/O is standard and does not involve external untrusted sources. Overall, the code appears to be a standard utility for testing Django models.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for testing Django models with django_dynamic_fixture, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It safely handles exceptions and generates reports. No security risks or malicious behaviors are identified.",
