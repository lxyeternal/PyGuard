  "purpose": "Utility for testing Django models with django_dynamic_fixture, attempting to instantiate models within transactions and generating reports.",
  "sources": "get_apps(), get_models_of_an_app(), get() from django_dynamic_fixture, file I/O for CSV output",
  "sinks": "File writing (save_csv), console output, model instantiation (get())",
  "flows": "Application labels input -> get_apps() -> get_models_of_an_app() -> get() for each model -> report generation -> optional CSV file creation",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or network activity detected; potential filename input risk if filename is user-controlled, but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code performs model instantiation testing within Django transactions, reports success and errors, and optionally outputs CSV reports. It uses standard libraries and functions with straightforward logic. No obfuscation, malicious code, or external data leaks are present. Exception handling is appropriate. The code's purpose is benign, and the operations are typical for testing utilities. No suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities are identified. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for testing Django models with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The scores are appropriate and should remain as-is. Overall, it poses a very low security risk.",
