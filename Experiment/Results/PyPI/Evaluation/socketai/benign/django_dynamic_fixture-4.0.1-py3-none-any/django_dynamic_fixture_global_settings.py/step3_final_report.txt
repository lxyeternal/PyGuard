{
  "purpose": "Configuration management and fixture setup for Django-based testing, involving dynamic class loading based on environment variables and settings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (via os.getenv), Django settings (via getattr), user-supplied strings for class paths (settings.DDF_DEFAULT_DATA_FIXTURE).",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import of modules and classes based on configuration strings, which could lead to loading untrusted code if configuration is malicious.",
  "flows": "Configuration values (from environment or settings) are used to determine module and class names, which are then imported and instantiated via import_module and get_mod_func.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import based on potentially user-controlled strings; exception handling is broad, masking specific errors; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves configuration from environment variables and Django settings, then dynamically imports classes based on these configurations. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are evident. The dynamic import pattern is common in plugin architectures but could be exploited if configuration inputs are maliciously manipulated. Exception handling is broad but does not introduce malicious behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious code structures are present. The overall pattern is standard and controlled, with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe and well-structured, with no malicious activity detected. The primary security concern is the potential for malicious configuration inputs to cause unintended code execution, but this is a known and manageable risk in plugin systems. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting cautious awareness of dynamic import risks. Overall, the code poses low security risk and is suitable for use in trusted environments.",
