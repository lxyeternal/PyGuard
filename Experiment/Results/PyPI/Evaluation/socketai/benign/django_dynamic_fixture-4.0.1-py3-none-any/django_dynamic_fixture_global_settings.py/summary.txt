  "conclusion": "The code is safe and well-structured, with no malicious activity detected. The primary security concern is the potential for malicious configuration inputs to cause unintended code execution, but this is a known and manageable risk in plugin systems. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting cautious awareness of dynamic import risks. Overall, the code poses low security risk and is suitable for use in trusted environments."
