  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Configuration management and fixture setup.\n- Findings: No hardcoded secrets or malicious code. Dynamic class loading based on user input could be risky but is standard practice.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Risk Score: 0.2 (low, due to potential manipulation of configuration input)\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that dynamic imports based on user-controlled input could be a concern but concludes that the code is generally safe. The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Similar configuration and fixture setup.\n- Findings: Dynamic import points could be manipulated if configuration is maliciously altered. Exception handling could mask errors but does not introduce malicious code.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Risk Score: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent with the code. The dynamic import via `import_module` and `get_mod_func` depends on trusted configuration. No malware is detected, and the risk score is appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for configuration management.\n- Findings: Similar to above, potential injection points via dynamic import, but no malicious intent or code.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Risk Score: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code. No malicious activity is present, and the risk score reflects the controlled nature of dynamic imports.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Fixture configuration in Django.\n- Findings: No malicious behavior, standard pattern, no data leakage or network activity.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Risk Score: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is consistent with the code, which is straightforward configuration management.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Fixture management with configuration retrieval.\n- Findings: No malicious code, dynamic import is standard but should be validated.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Risk Score: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis is appropriate. No malware detected; the risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Behavior:**  \n  The code primarily handles configuration retrieval from environment variables and Django settings, then dynamically imports classes based on user-supplied strings. This pattern is common in plugin-based systems and does not inherently imply malicious intent.\n\n- **Malware Risk:**  \n  No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code snippets. The dynamic import mechanism could be exploited if an attacker can control the configuration input, but this is a known risk in such systems and not necessarily malicious.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  No obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Scores Consistency:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate. Risk scores are uniformly low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  **Should remain at 0.** No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  **Should remain at 0.** Code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  **Maintain at ~0.2.** The primary concern is the potential for configuration manipulation affecting dynamic imports, but this is a standard and controlled pattern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Recommended Value | Justification                                               |\n|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                   | No malicious code or behavior detected.                     |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                   | Code is transparent and straightforward.                     |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2                 | Slight risk due to dynamic import based on user input, but standard and controlled. |\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, with minimal security concerns.**",
