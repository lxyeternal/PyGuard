  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential vulnerabilities, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code primarily handles configuration retrieval from environment variables and Django settings.\n- It performs dynamic imports based on configuration values, which could be risky if untrusted input is provided.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code snippets are present.\n- The code uses standard patterns for plugin/configurable systems, with exception handling and warnings.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Score:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The report correctly notes that the code is standard and safe.\n- The low risk score is appropriate given the dynamic import based on user-controlled input, but the overall risk remains low because of controlled usage.\n- Malware score is correctly zero; no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:**\n- The score aligns well with the analysis.\n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Score:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the controlled nature of dynamic imports.\n- The potential risk from dynamic import is acknowledged but considered minimal.\n- Malware score remains zero, which is correct.\n\n**Verdict:**\n- The scores are reasonable.\n- No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Score:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Again, the dynamic import based on configuration is the main concern, but standard practice mitigates most risks.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:**\n- The scores are justified and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Score:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The report emphasizes the lack of malicious activity.\n- The absence of any security concerns justifies a zero risk score.\n- Dynamic import is considered safe in this context.\n\n**Verdict:**\n- The score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Score:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Similar to previous reports, with recognition of the controlled dynamic import.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- Slightly elevated risk score (0.2) is reasonable due to dynamic import based on potentially user-controlled strings, but overall low.\n\n**Verdict:**\n- The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All correctly assign 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slight variation, but generally around 0.2, which is reasonable given the dynamic import pattern, though it is a common practice in plugin systems.\n\n**Potential Adjustments:**\n- The risk scores could be slightly lowered to 0 in some reports if the context guarantees that configuration values are always trusted, but in general, keeping them at 0.2 reflects cautious awareness of dynamic import risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (leaning towards 0.1 if strict trust in configuration is assumed)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is standard configuration management code with controlled dynamic imports.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The current scores are reasonable; minor adjustments could be made if further context confirms configuration safety.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Given the evidence, I agree with the existing assessments. The code is safe, with minimal security concern related to dynamic import usage, which is a common pattern in plugin-based systems.",
