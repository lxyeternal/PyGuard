{
  "purpose": "Defines custom JSON and Array fields for Django models, supporting different database backends, including SQLite.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from django.conf.settings, JSON data in database fields, and input values in to_python and get_prep_value methods.",
  "sinks": "json.loads (deserializing data), json.dumps (serializing data), returning string representations of data.",
  "flows": "Data read from database fields -> deserialized via json.loads -> potentially manipulated -> serialized via json.dumps -> stored back into database.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval-like json.loads without validation is standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. Dynamic class definition for SQLite support is standard. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom Django model fields to handle JSON and Array data types, with conditional logic for SQLite support. The JSON parsing and serialization methods are standard and safe if used correctly. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious or malicious patterns, and employs common practices for database-agnostic handling of JSON fields.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate extension of Django's ORM for handling JSON and array data types, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
