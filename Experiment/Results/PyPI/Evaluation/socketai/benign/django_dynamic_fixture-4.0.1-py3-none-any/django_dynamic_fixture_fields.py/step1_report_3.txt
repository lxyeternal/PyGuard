  "purpose": "Define custom JSON and Array fields for Django models, supporting different database backends including SQLite.",
  "sources": "Reading Django settings, importing JSON data, and handling database field values (from_db_value, to_python, get_prep_value).",
  "targets": "Data serialization/deserialization methods (from_db_value, to_python, get_prep_value), and cloning of fields for migration.",
  "flows": "Data is read from the database (from_db_value), processed into Python objects (to_python), and prepared for storage (get_prep_value).",
  "anomalies": "Use of string conversion for JSON data in SQLite; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code; no network or system commands. The field cloning uses .clone(), but this is standard for Django fields.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom JSON and Array fields for Django models, with support for SQLite by overriding db_type and data conversion methods. The JSONField implementation converts data to and from JSON strings, and ArrayField extends it with additional parameters. No suspicious code, network operations, or data leaks are evident. The code appears standard for Django custom fields, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django model field extension for handling JSON and array data across different databases. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a standard, safe implementation for database fields.",
