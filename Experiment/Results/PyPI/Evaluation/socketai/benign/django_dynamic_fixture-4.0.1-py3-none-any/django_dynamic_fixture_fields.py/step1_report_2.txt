  "purpose": "Define custom JSON and Array fields for Django models, with special handling for SQLite database backend.",
  "sources": "Imports from Django modules, usage of settings.DATABASES, and methods that serialize/deserialize JSON data.",
  "sinks": "json.loads, json.dumps, and database field methods that process data before saving or after retrieval.",
  "flows": "Data flows from database input (from_db_value) or model object (value_to_string) through JSON serialization/deserialization functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or malicious logic; code appears to implement standard serialization/deserialization with conditional handling for SQLite.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally redefines JSONField and ArrayField for SQLite databases to handle JSON data as text, avoiding unsupported JSON types. The functions perform JSON serialization/deserialization, with exception handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration. Use of standard libraries and safe practices. No suspicious or obfuscated code detected. No external network or system modifications observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard data handling for JSON and Array fields in Django with SQLite support, without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate application code with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior.",
