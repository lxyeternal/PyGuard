{
  "purpose": "Define various Django models with optional fields based on available external libraries, primarily for handling JSON data and polymorphic models.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported libraries and defines model fields; no external user input handling is evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data or perform security-critical operations; models are for data storage definitions only.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code simply defines models and handles import failures gracefully.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of try-except for optional imports is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports various JSONField implementations and polymorphic models depending on library availability, with fallback messages for missing libraries. All models are standard Django ORM definitions with no dynamic execution, code injection, or malicious logic. No untrusted data handling or security-sensitive operations are observed. The code's behavior is benign, focusing solely on model structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Django models definition with conditional imports; no malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are identified. It appears to be a normal, benign component of a Django project.",
