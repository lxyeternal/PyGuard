{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple Django models with various JSONField implementations and a polymorphic model setup, primarily for database schema definitions and dynamic model handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements and class definitions, with no direct user input, network calls, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as data output, network transmission, or file writes. The models only define database schema.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code mainly loads modules and defines classes without executing untrusted code or processing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes conditional imports with fallback messages, but no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The exception handling is straightforward. No suspicious dynamic execution or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import optional Django JSONField modules from different libraries, providing fallback mechanisms if libraries are missing. It also defines polymorphic models, which are standard patterns in Django for model inheritance. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to be standard, safe schema definition code with proper exception handling. No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious intent are detectable from the provided fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of Django models with optional JSONField support and polymorphic models. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is present.",
