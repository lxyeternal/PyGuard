{
  "purpose": "This code defines several Django models with different JSONField implementations and polymorphic models, primarily for database schema setup and polymorphic inheritance.",
  "sources": "Imports of various JSONField and polymorphic libraries, model definitions, and their class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None of the code includes data processing, input handling, or untrusted data outputs that could be exploited or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Imports lead to model definitions which involve static schema setup. There are no data flows involving untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Conditional imports handle missing libraries gracefully without executing malicious code. No obfuscated or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports multiple optional external libraries related to JSON fields and polymorphic models for Django. It defines models with fields that depend on the availability of these libraries. The model definitions are straightforward, with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors. No signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection, are evident. The code appears to be standard setup for a Django application with optional dependencies, with error handling for missing modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Django model definitions with conditional imports and no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not involve untrusted data processing or security-sensitive operations beyond typical ORM schema definitions.",
