  "purpose": "Define various Django models with optional JSON fields and polymorphic models, depending on available external libraries.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external libraries and model definitions utilizing those libraries.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Imports are conditional; models are defined based on successful imports but do not process external data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code mainly handles optional imports and model definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import various external JSON field libraries and defines Django models accordingly. These operations are standard and do not involve untrusted input or data handling. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior is evident. The conditional import blocks are designed to handle missing dependencies gracefully. The polymorphic models do not perform any malicious actions or sensitive operations. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward model setup without malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Django model setup that conditionally includes optional JSON field libraries and polymorphic models. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard implementation pattern with no security concerns identified.",
