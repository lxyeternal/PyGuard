  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code**\n\n- The code reads the database engine from Django settings: `settings.DATABASES['default']['ENGINE']`.\n- It defines constants for database types.\n- Provides two decorators: `skip_for_database` and `only_for_database`, which execute test functions conditionally based on whether the current database matches the specified type.\n- The logic is straightforward, with no external inputs, outputs, or data processing beyond configuration checks.\n- No signs of code obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears correct and benign. No issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**\n\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is safe, straightforward, and intended for testing purposes.\n- They mention the code reads configuration, uses conditional decorators, and does not process untrusted data.\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning. They correctly interpret the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' reasoning is sound and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**3. Review of the Scores Assigned to Each Issue**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - purpose: accurate\n  - sources: accurate\n  - sinks: none\n  - flows: correct\n  - anomalies: none\n  - analysis: correct\n  - conclusion: safe, benign\n  - confidence: 1\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\n- These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n**Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores align well with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**\n\n- All reports assign `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0`.\n- The code does not execute untrusted data, does not connect to external systems, nor contains any malicious constructs.\n- The purpose is for testing, which is common and safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** No justification for higher risk scores; current scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**5. Malware Score Consideration**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or executing untrusted input.\n- The decorators only control test execution flow based on configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:** Malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n---\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions**\n\n- All reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- The code's behavior is standard and safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n---\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n\n- All reports are consistent: no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores reflect the benign nature accurately.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a simple, standard utility for conditional test execution based on Django database settings. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, no obfuscation, and no security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. The scoring is appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns.",
