  "purpose": "Configure and provide decorators to run test cases conditionally based on the database backend in a Django environment.",
  "sources": "Access to settings.DATABASES['default']['ENGINE'] to determine database engine type.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks identified; decorators influence test execution flow based on database engine string.",
  "flows": "The source (DATABASE_ENGINE) is used in conditional checks within decorators to control test execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no unusual behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django settings and retrieves the database engine type from the configuration. It defines constants for common database types. Two decorators, 'skip_for_database' and 'only_for_database', are provided to conditionally execute test functions depending on whether the current database matches the specified one. The decorators check if the target database string is in the DATABASE_ENGINE value (which is expected to be a string). There are no apparent security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation. The code is typical for test setup in Django projects, with no indicators of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for conditional test execution based on database backend in Django projects. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials or sensitive data, and poses no security risks.",
