  "purpose": "Utility decorators for conditional test execution based on Django database engine configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads the database engine string from settings.DATABASES['default']['ENGINE'].",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The decorators compare the input parameter 'database' to the DATABASE_ENGINE string and decide whether to execute the test function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django settings, retrieves the database engine string, and defines two decorators that conditionally execute test functions based on whether the current database matches a specified type. The logic is simple string containment checks, with no external inputs processed or malicious actions performed. The code is standard for testing utilities, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for controlling test execution based on database configuration. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and poses no security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
