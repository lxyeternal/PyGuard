{
  "purpose": "This code defines utility decorators for Django tests to conditionally run test cases based on the database engine being used.",
  "sources": "The code reads the database engine type from Django settings: settings.DATABASES['default']['ENGINE']",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external system interactions are present in the code",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading the database engine from settings and applying decorators that execute test functions conditionally based on the engine",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. It relies on standard Django settings and simple conditional logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django settings to determine the database engine in use. It defines two decorators: 'skip_for_database' and 'only_for_database', which wrap test functions to control their execution based on the database type. No untrusted input, external connections, or malicious code execution pathways are present. The code appears to be straightforward, standard testing utility functions without obfuscated or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility module for conditional test execution based on database backend. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It simply reads configuration data and applies conditional decorators. Overall, it appears safe and intended for testing purposes.",
