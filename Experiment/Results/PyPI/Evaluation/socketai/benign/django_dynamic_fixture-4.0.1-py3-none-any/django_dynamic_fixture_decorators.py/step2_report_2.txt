  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality and Behavior:**\n   - The code imports Django settings and reads the database engine string from `settings.DATABASES['default']['ENGINE']`.\n   - It defines constants for various database types.\n   - It provides two decorators:\n     - `skip_for_database`: skips executing the test if the current database matches the specified one.\n     - `only_for_database`: executes the test only if the current database matches the specified one.\n   - The logic is straightforward: the decorators check if the database string is in `DATABASE_ENGINE` and then decide whether to run the test function.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No untrusted data sinks, external system calls, or code execution pathways are present.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or complex logic.\n   - The code is purely utility for testing purposes, designed to conditionally run tests based on configuration.\n\n3. **Potential Security Risks:**\n   - The code reads configuration data at module load time, which is standard.\n   - No external inputs are processed that could lead to injection or malicious behavior.\n   - No data leaks or backdoors are evident.\n\n4. **Score Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0. The code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0. The code is a benign utility for testing, with no security implications.\n\n5. **Any Errors or Flaws in the Report:**\n   - The reports consistently agree that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n   - The scores assigned (all zero for malware and obfuscation, and zero for risk) are appropriate.\n\n6. **Any Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as utility functions for test control, with no assumptions about malicious intent.\n   - No unwarranted security concerns are raised.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a simple, standard utility for conditional test execution based on database backend in Django.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is safe, straightforward, and intended solely for testing purposes.\n\n**Overall assessment:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No changes to the scoring or conclusions are necessary.",
