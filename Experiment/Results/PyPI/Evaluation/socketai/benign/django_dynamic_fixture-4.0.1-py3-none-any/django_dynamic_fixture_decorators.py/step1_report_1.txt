{
  "purpose": "Provides decorators to conditionally execute test cases based on the database engine used in a Django application.",
  "sources": "Reads database engine configuration from Django settings via 'settings.DATABASES['default']['ENGINE']'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only performs conditional checks and function wrapping without executing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads database engine config -> conditional check within decorators -> executes or skips test functions based on the database type.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation observed. The code performs straightforward conditional decoration logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports database configuration settings, defines constants for various database types, and provides two decorators for conditional test execution. The decorators check if the current database matches specified types and execute the test functions accordingly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The logic is simple and aligns with standard testing patterns. No unsafe code practices or suspicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for testing purposes, allowing selective execution based on database type. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
