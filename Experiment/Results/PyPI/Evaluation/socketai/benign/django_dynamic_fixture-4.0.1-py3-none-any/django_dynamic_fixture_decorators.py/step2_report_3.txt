  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Logic:**\n   - The code imports Django settings and retrieves the database engine string from `settings.DATABASES['default']['ENGINE']`.\n   - It defines constants for various database types.\n   - Two decorators are provided:\n     - `skip_for_database`: executes the test function if the current database is *not* the specified one.\n     - `only_for_database`: executes the test function only if the current database *is* the specified one.\n   - The decorators perform simple string containment checks (`if database in DATABASE_ENGINE`) to determine whether to run the test.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks:**\n   - No untrusted data sinks, external connections, or data processing of user input.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code is straightforward, serving as a utility for test control based on configuration.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently state that the code is benign, standard, and intended for conditional test execution.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or signs of malicious intent are detected.\n   - The reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - The malware score is correctly 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, matching the straightforward code.\n   - The security risk score is 0, as the code does not introduce vulnerabilities or security concerns.\n   - The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n5. **Potential Improvements or Clarifications:**\n   - The string containment check (`if database in DATABASE_ENGINE`) assumes `DATABASE_ENGINE` is a string. If `DATABASE_ENGINE` is a list or other data structure, this could cause issues, but based on the code, it appears to be a string.\n   - The code could be slightly more robust by normalizing case (e.g., converting both strings to lowercase) to avoid case sensitivity issues, but this is a minor point.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a benign utility for testing purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
