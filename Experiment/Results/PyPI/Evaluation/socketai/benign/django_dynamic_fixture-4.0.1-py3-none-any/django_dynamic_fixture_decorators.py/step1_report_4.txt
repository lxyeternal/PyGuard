{
  "purpose": "To provide decorators for conditional execution of test cases based on the database engine used in Django settings.",
  "sources": "Reads the database engine type from Django settings via settings.DATABASES['default']['ENGINE']",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or user input",
  "flows": "The code reads the database engine configuration and conditionally executes test functions based on the engine type",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and uses standard Django settings access. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django settings and extracts the database engine configuration. It defines two decorators, 'skip_for_database' and 'only_for_database', which execute test functions conditionally based on whether the current database engine matches specified values. The implementation uses nested functions to create decorators with custom behavior. No malicious or suspicious logic is present; the code serves as a utility for conditional testing based on database type.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for test conditionally based on database type in Django projects. No malicious intent or malicious behavior is detected. The code does not include any malware, security risks, or obfuscated code.",
