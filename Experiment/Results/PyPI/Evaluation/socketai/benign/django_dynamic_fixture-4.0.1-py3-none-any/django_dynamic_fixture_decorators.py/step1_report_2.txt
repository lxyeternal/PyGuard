{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators to conditionally execute test cases based on the database engine configured in Django settings.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from django.conf.settings.DATABASES to determine the database engine.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or security effects are present.",
  "flows": "The source is read at the module load time to set DATABASE_ENGINE; the decorators then conditionally execute test functions based on this value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs straightforward conditional logic without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django settings and retrieves the database engine from the configuration. It defines two decorators, skip_for_database and only_for_database, which execute test functions depending on whether the current database matches the specified target. The logic is simple and intended for testing purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. There are no external inputs or outputs that could be exploited for security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing utility for Django projects, used to run or skip tests based on database backend. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears safe.",
