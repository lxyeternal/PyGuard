      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is safe and well-structured, with no malicious activity detected. The primary security concern is the potential for malicious configuration inputs to cause unintended code execution, but this is a known and manageable risk in plugin systems. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting cautious awareness of dynamic import risks. Overall, the code poses low security risk and is suitable for use in trusted environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is a typical pattern for conditional test fixture imports in Django projects. There is no indication of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities within this snippet. The risk primarily hinges on external trust in 'django_dynamic_fixture'. The scores from the reports are consistent with this assessment."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for managing test fixtures in Django projects. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The minimal security risk score accounts for potential misuse if untrusted inputs are fed into the functions, but this is typical for such utilities and not indicative of malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate extension for Django models to support JSON and Array fields across different databases. There is no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The slight security considerations relate to JSON deserialization of untrusted data, but this is a common pattern and not a vulnerability in itself."

      "conclusion": "The fixture utility is well-structured and functional but relies on eval() for dynamic method calls, posing a security risk. No malicious activity or malware is detected. To mitigate risks, replacing eval() with safer alternatives like getattr() with input validation is recommended."

The minor database access functions are typical in test fixtures and do not introduce vulnerabilities. The optional dependencies are handled safely. The overall security risk score should be very low, around 0.1, reflecting minimal potential for misuse but no actual malicious intent."
