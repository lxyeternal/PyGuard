  "purpose": "The code conditionally imports all models from django_dynamic_fixture.models_test based on a configuration setting.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'IMPORT_DDF_MODELS' setting from Django settings.",
  "sinks": "Import statement that loads potentially many models from an external module.",
  "flows": "Setting retrieval from Django settings → conditional check → import of external models if true.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a broad import (*) which can import many objects, potentially including malicious or unnecessary code, but this is standard in testing fixtures context; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves a configuration flag from Django settings and conditionally imports a module that presumably contains test models for fixtures. The import is dynamic and conditional, which is common in test or development environments. There are no signs of malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code relies on external settings, and the import could be potentially misused if the imported module contains malicious code, but nothing indicates malicious intent here. No obfuscation or malware-like behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard conditional import based on a configuration setting, likely for testing purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
