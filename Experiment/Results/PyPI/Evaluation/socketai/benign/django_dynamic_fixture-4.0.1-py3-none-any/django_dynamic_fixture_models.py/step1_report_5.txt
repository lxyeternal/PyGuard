  "purpose": "Conditionally import models from django_dynamic_fixture.models_test based on a setting",

  "sinks": "Import statement which loads potentially large or complex models for testing",
  "flows": "Reading setting -> Conditional check -> Import models if true",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious logic present. The import depends on a configuration setting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django settings, retrieves a boolean configuration 'IMPORT_DDF_MODELS', and conditionally imports a module from django_dynamic_fixture. The use of 'getattr' with a default of False is standard and does not introduce security issues. The conditional import is based solely on configuration, with no embedded malicious behavior or obfuscation. There are no signs of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious code. The module imported is likely used for testing or fixture purposes, which is common in development environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration-based conditional import for testing purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
