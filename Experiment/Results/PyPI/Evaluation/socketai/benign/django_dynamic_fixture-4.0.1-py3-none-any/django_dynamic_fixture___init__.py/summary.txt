  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for managing test fixtures in Django projects. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The minimal security risk score accounts for potential misuse if untrusted inputs are fed into the functions, but this is typical for such utilities and not indicative of malicious intent."
