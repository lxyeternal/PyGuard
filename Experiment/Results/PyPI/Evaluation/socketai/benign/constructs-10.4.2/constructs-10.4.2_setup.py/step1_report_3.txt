  "purpose": "Load package metadata from a JSON string and configure package setup with setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading embedded JSON string, reading README.md file",
  "sinks": "Passing data to setuptools.setup() for package installation",
  "flows": "JSON data is loaded into kwargs, then extended with README content, then used in setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected; no external or untrusted data sources involved",
  "analysis": "The code loads a static JSON string describing package metadata, reads the README.md file to set the long_description, and then calls setuptools.setup() with this data. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. No malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior is present. The use of local static data and file reading is typical for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a standard setup procedure for a Python package with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
