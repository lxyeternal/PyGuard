  "purpose": "Load package metadata from static JSON, read README.md for description, and invoke setuptools.setup() for package installation.",
  "sources": "Static JSON string defining package metadata, reading 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "Data passed directly to setuptools.setup(), no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "JSON data flows into setup parameters; README.md content flows into long_description; both used in setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static data, no dynamic code, no secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, loading static metadata and description, then calling setuptools.setup(). No dynamic execution, network activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. All signals indicate standard packaging behavior with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no security concerns or malicious behavior detected. The static JSON and file reading are typical and safe.",
