  "purpose": "This script loads package metadata from a JSON string and uses setuptools to set up a Python package.",
  "sources": "json.loads() parsing the JSON string, open() reading the README.md file",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() function call, which defines package installation behavior",
  "flows": "JSON string parsed by json.loads(), then passed as kwargs to setuptools.setup(), and reading README.md content for long_description",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed; no obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected",
  "analysis": "The code parses a static JSON string containing package metadata, then reads a README.md file for description content. It then calls setuptools.setup() with these parameters. The JSON content appears to be standard package info without any malicious commands or data flows. No external network communication, no dynamic code execution, no embedded secrets or sensitive data. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts, with no anomalies or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup utility for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
