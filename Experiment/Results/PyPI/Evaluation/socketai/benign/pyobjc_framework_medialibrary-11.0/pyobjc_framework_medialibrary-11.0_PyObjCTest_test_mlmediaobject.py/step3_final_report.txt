  "purpose": "To verify that MediaLibrary.MLMediaObject is an Objective-C class on macOS 10.9+.",
  "sources": "Import statements for TestCase, min_os_level, objc, and MediaLibrary; the decorator min_os_level(\"10.9\"); the attribute MediaLibrary.MLMediaObject.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "The test runs on macOS 10.9+ and checks the type of MediaLibrary.MLMediaObject without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class existence check, no obfuscation, no malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple unit test verifying the existence and type of MLMediaObject in MediaLibrary, conditioned on macOS 10.9+. It imports necessary modules, applies a version check, and asserts the class type. No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing occurs. The code is standard, benign, and safe. All reports correctly interpret this, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No issues or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs a straightforward class existence check, and poses no security or malicious risk. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
