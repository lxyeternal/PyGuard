  "purpose": "The code is a unit test verifying the existence and type of MediaLibrary.MLMediaSource on macOS 10.9+.",
  "sources": "Import statements for TestSupport, objc, and MediaLibrary modules; the decorator min_os_level; the class attribute MediaLibrary.MLMediaSource.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The test checks the class type of MediaLibrary.MLMediaSource without data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class existence check with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, environment-specific unit test that asserts MediaLibrary.MLMediaSource is an objc class. It uses standard testing patterns, OS version gating, and a direct assertion. No network activity, data processing, or malicious code is present. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or secrets. The scores from the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent and justified based on the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, environment-aware unit test verifying class existence in MediaLibrary. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
