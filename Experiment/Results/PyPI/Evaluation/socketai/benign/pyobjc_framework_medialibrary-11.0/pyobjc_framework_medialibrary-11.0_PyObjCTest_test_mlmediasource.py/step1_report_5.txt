  "purpose": "Unit test for MediaLibrary.MLMediaSource class, verifying OS level availability and class instance.",
  "sources": "import statements: PyObjCTools.TestSupport, objc, MediaLibrary",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks observed; code performs static checks and assertions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no dynamic data handling or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Uses decorators for OS-level checks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing and media library modules, then defines a test case class with a method that verifies the existence of a specific class under certain OS conditions. The test performs a static assertion without any data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code is standard for a unit test suite targeting a specific OS version.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit test for verifying class existence under specific OS conditions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
