  "purpose": "Unit test for MediaLibrary.MLMediaSource class on macOS 10.9+",
  "sources": "Imports modules (PyObjCTools.TestSupport, objc, MediaLibrary) and uses a decorator to check OS version",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data processing, network, or file operations present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; test assertions do not involve untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing tools and media library modules, then defines a test case that verifies the class type of MLMediaSource on macOS 10.9 or later. The use of decorators and assertions aligns with standard testing practices. No untrusted data handling, network operations, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a straightforward test case without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for a media library class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
