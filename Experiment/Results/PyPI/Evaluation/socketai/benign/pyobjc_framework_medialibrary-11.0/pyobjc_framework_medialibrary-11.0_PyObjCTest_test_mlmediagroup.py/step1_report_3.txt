  "purpose": "Unit test for MediaLibrary.MLMediaGroup class to ensure it is an Objective-C class on macOS 10.9+",
  "sources": "Import statements for TestSupport, objc, and MediaLibrary modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communications present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily import and class type check operations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated patterns observed; straightforward test code",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing support, objc bridging, and MediaLibrary modules. It defines a test case with a method that asserts MLMediaGroup is an Objective-C class, conditioned on macOS 10.9 or higher. There are no data inputs, external network interactions, or suspicious constructs. The purpose appears to be standard unit testing without malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test for verifying class types in macOS frameworks, with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
