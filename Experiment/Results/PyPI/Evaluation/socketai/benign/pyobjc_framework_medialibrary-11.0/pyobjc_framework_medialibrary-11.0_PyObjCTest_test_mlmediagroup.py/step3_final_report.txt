  "purpose": "A unit test verifying that MediaLibrary.MLMediaGroup is an Objective-C class on macOS 10.9+.",
  "sources": "Import statements for TestCase, min_os_level, objc, MediaLibrary; class definition; version guard; class assertion.",
  "sinks": "Assertion checking class type; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Import statements and class definition lead to the assertion within the version guard.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class existence check with no suspicious code, obfuscation, or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing and Objective-C bridge modules, defines a test class with a method that asserts the existence of a specific Objective-C class, guarded by a macOS version check. The code performs a simple type assertion without any network, data leaks, or malicious logic. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code is a standard, safe unit test for framework compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple class existence check with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
