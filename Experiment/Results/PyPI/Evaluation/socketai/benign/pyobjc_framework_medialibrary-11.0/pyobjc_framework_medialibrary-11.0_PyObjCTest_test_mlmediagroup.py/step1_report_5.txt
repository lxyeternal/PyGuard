  "purpose": "The code is a test case that verifies the existence of a specific MediaLibrary class on macOS 10.9 or later.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external modules: PyObjCTools.TestSupport, objc, MediaLibrary",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data outputs or external communications",
  "flows": "Import modules -> run test class -> assert class type",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual dynamic code, no suspicious variable names or obfuscation, no malicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing tools and media library modules, then defines a test case to check if 'MLMediaGroup' exists as an Objective-C class, with a version check for macOS 10.9 or higher. The structure is straightforward, following standard testing practices. No indications of malicious activity, data leaks, or backdoors are present. The code performs a simple class existence check without any network or system modification behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for a media library class on macOS, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
