{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup and build script for the PyObjC framework, handling configuration, compilation, testing, and packaging on macOS systems.",
  "sources": "System commands (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), environment variables, SDKSettings.plist files, and dynamic module imports for configuration and testing.",
  "sinks": "System info collection via subprocess, modification of sys.path and sys.modules, file reads/writes for build info, and test suite execution.",
  "flows": "Sources such as subprocess outputs and environment variables influence build flags, SDK detection, and test setup; no untrusted data flows into network or system modification beyond standard build info gathering.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. Use of 'os.popen' is noted but is typical for build scripts and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard build and test setup tasks for a macOS-specific Python extension. It uses subprocess calls to gather system information, reads configuration files, and manipulates sys.path for testing. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration patterns are present. The code is clear, purpose-driven, and relies on common practices for such build scripts. The reliance on subprocess for system info is typical and not inherently malicious, though it could be exploited if environment is compromised. Overall, the code is benign, with no security threats or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build and test utility for PyObjC, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are justified and appropriate given the context.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
