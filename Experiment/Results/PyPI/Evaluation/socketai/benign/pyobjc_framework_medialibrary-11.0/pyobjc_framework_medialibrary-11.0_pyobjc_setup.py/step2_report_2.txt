  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a build/test setup for PyObjC, heavily reliant on system commands and file operations. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, as the script performs typical build tasks, with some reliance on subprocess calls that could be manipulated in an untrusted environment, but no evident malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is reasonable. The script is a typical build script with no malicious indicators.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed. The scores and reasoning are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on system info gathering and build configuration. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — still low, given the nature of the script.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change. The scores seem justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script performs build setup, SDK detection, and test execution. No suspicious activity or malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, typical for build scripts.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious activity.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on build and test configuration, system info, and environment setup.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is appropriate; no malicious indicators.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a comprehensive build and test utility, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there are no malicious behaviors detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero but very low, reflecting the nature of build scripts that invoke system commands, which is typical and not inherently risky.\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, typical for build scripts that interact with system utilities but no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, justified, and appropriately scored. No adjustments are necessary.",
