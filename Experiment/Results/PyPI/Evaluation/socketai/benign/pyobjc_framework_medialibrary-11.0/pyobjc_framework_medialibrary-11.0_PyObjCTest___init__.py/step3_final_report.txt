  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple comment with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comment string ('\"\"\" Testsuite \"\"\"') with no executable content, data sources, sinks, or flows. All reports correctly identify that it is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No assumptions beyond the visible comment are made, and the assessments are accurate and justified.",
