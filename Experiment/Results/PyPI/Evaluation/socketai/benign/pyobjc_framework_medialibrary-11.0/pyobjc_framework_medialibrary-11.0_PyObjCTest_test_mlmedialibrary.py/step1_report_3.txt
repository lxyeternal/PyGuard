{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test suite for the MediaLibrary framework, verifying the presence and types of certain constants and classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from PyObjCTools, objc, and MediaLibrary modules; testing functions that access class attributes and constants.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The code accesses constant values and class types directly; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code appears to perform standard type and existence checks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, then defines a test class that checks for class types and string constants within the MediaLibrary framework at different OS levels. All operations are standard assertions verifying attribute existence and types. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is purely for testing and validation purposes, with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite for MediaLibrary constants and classes, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It functions as intended for validation without engaging in any harmful or suspicious operations.",
