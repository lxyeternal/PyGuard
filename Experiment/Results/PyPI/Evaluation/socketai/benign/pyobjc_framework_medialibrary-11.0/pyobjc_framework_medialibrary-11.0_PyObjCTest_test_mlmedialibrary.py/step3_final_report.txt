{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test suite verifying the existence and types of constants and classes within the MediaLibrary framework, primarily for compatibility and correctness checks.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class attributes and constants from the MediaLibrary module, performing assertions on their types.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs, network operations, or data leaks; the code only performs static assertions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules to asserting types of constants and classes, with no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and purpose-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static test suite verifying class types and string constants in the MediaLibrary module. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated code. The assertions are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code's purpose is benign, and its structure is clear and conventional. Given the absence of malicious or security-compromising elements, the code poses no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward unit test verifying constants and class types, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities detected.",
