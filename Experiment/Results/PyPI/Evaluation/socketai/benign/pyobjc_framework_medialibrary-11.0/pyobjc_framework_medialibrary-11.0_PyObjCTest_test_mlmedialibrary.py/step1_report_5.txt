  "purpose": "Unit tests for MediaLibrary module and checking constants and class types at specific OS levels.",
  "sources": "Imported modules: TestSupport, objc, MediaLibrary; uses class attributes from MediaLibrary.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network, file operations, or data output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static type and constant checks.",
  "anomalies": "Code performs straightforward type assertions; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test class verifying the existence and types of constants and classes in the MediaLibrary module. It uses decorators to target specific OS versions. There are no signs of input handling, data processing, or untrusted data flows. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious behavior indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of unit tests for media library constants and classes, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
