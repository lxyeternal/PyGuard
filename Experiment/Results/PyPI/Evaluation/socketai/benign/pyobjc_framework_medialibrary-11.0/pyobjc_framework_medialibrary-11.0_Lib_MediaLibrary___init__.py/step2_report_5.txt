  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code dynamically loads the MediaLibrary framework on macOS using `objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr`.\n- It sets up `__dir__` and `__getattr__` for lazy attribute access.\n- It deletes the `_metadata` module from `sys.modules` after setup.\n- The code appears to be a standard pattern for wrapping Objective-C frameworks in Python.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- The dynamic framework loading is typical for such bindings.\n- The deletion of `_metadata` from `sys.modules` is a cleanup step, not suspicious.\n\n### Logical errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors are evident.\n- The code is straightforward and follows common patterns.\n- The removal of `_metadata` is unconventional but not harmful or malicious.\n\n### Scores given in reports:\n- All reports assign malware scores of **0**.\n- All reports assign obfuscated scores of **0**.\n- Security risk scores are very low (0.1–0.2), which is reasonable given the context.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes. Since there's no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious data flow, these scores are appropriate.\n\n### Risk justification:\n- The code performs framework setup, which is inherently safe.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent or behavior.\n- Dynamic loading via `objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr` is standard in such scenarios.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- Some reports mention the dynamic nature of attribute creation as a potential vector, but in this context, it's a standard pattern.\n- No external inputs or untrusted data are involved.\n- No network activity or code execution of untrusted data.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores align with the analysis: no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The confidence levels (0.9) are justified given the clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal risk, mainly due to dynamic loading, which is standard here)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate framework wrapper, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports correctly identify the code as a standard, safe framework setup routine. No changes to the scores are necessary. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the security risk is minimal.",
