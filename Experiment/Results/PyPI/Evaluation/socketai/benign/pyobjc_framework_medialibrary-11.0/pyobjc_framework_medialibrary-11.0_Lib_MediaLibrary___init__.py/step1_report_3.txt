  "purpose": "Initialize and set up the MediaLibrary framework interface by dynamically creating module attributes and importing necessary components.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, AppKit, Quartz, objc, and internal _metadata; dynamic creation of framework directory and getter functions via objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or data leakage points are present.",
  "flows": "Import and setup functions flow into the dynamic assignment of __dir__ and __getattr__ functions; no external input flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic framework loading and attribute creation which could be a vector for obfuscation or delayed malicious code execution if misused, but in this context, it appears standard for framework initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a setup routine for the MediaLibrary framework using Apple's Objective-C bridge. It imports system and framework modules, then calls a function to dynamically generate __dir__ and __getattr__ for the module, enabling lazy loading of framework attributes. It deletes a module reference after setup. There are no suspicious data flows, hardcoded credentials, or malicious operations. The dynamic framework loading is typical for bridging frameworks and does not indicate malicious intent in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard framework setup script utilizing dynamic attribute creation for lazy loading. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The dynamic framework handling is appropriate for its purpose and does not pose security threats.",
