  "purpose": "To dynamically load and initialize the MediaLibrary framework for use within Python, facilitating access to Apple's MediaLibrary APIs.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, AppKit, Quartz, objc, _metadata), and the createFrameworkDirAndGetattr function which loads framework components.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into critical operations or sensitive data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Importing modules -> calling createFrameworkDirAndGetattr -> setting __dir__ and __getattr__ -> deleting _metadata module from sys.modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic framework loading via objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr is complex but not inherently malicious; no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected. The code removes _metadata from sys.modules after setup, which might be unconventional but not suspicious per se.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and external frameworks, then dynamically constructs framework access functions with objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr, which is typical for bridging to Objective-C frameworks. The removal of _metadata from sys.modules suggests cleanup after setup. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious data flows, or obfuscation. The purpose appears to be framework initialization, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard framework setup routine using Objective-C bridging to access macOS frameworks. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
