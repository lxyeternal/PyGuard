{
  "purpose": "Dynamically loads the macOS MediaLibrary framework and sets up attribute access functions for Python binding.",
  "sources": "The import of sys, AppKit, Quartz, objc modules; the call to objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr for framework loading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or system modification operations.",
  "flows": "Source: import statements and framework path; Sink: assignment of __dir__ and __getattr__ functions; flow through dynamic attribute creation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic framework loading and attribute creation; deletion of _metadata from sys.modules; no explicit validation or error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Objective-C framework binding in Python, utilizing objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr to generate attribute access functions. It assigns these functions to __dir__ and __getattr__, enabling lazy loading of framework symbols. The removal of _metadata from sys.modules is a cleanup step. No suspicious data flows, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The pattern is common in Python bindings for macOS frameworks. Given the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1-0.2). The code is benign and aligns with standard practices for such bindings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Python wrapper for the MediaLibrary framework with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
