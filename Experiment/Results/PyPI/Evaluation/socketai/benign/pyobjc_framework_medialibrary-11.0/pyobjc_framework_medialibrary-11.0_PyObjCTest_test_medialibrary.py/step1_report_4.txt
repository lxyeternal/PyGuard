  "purpose": "Unit test for the MediaLibrary package to verify callable metadata integrity",
  "sources": "Import statements from external modules (PyObjCTools.TestSupport, MediaLibrary)",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data sinks or output operations observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; test invocation does not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; straightforward test code",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing support and the MediaLibrary module, then defines a test case class with a single test method that asserts the sanity of callable metadata within MediaLibrary. The code appears to be a standard unit test with no dynamic code execution, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. It does not include hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated constructs. The focus is on verifying metadata integrity, which is typical in testing scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit testing script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs a basic test on the MediaLibrary module and contains no suspicious behavior.",
