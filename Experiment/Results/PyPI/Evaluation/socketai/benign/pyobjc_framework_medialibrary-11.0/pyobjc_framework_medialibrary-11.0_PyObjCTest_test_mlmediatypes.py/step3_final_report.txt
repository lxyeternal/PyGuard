{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test suite verifying the existence, types, and expected values of constants and enum types within the MediaLibrary framework across different OS versions. It ensures that constants are correctly defined and accessible.",
  "sources": "The code reads predefined constants and enum types from the MediaLibrary module, primarily through attribute access and assertions.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks, external inputs, or outputs; the code performs static assertions without processing untrusted data or executing dynamic code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing constants and enum types to asserting their types and values, with no external data or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and static, serving as validation tests.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static test suite that verifies constants and enum types within the MediaLibrary framework. It uses assertions to confirm types (str or int) and specific values, organized by OS version. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data handling, or malicious code. The structure is standard for API validation, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's benign, static nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard validation suite for MediaLibrary constants and enum types. It poses no security risks, contains no malicious activity, and is free of obfuscation. The scores of zero across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
