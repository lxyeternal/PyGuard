  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Security Implications:**\n   - The code is a standard setup script for a Python package wrapping the macOS MediaLibrary framework via PyObjC.\n   - It primarily involves package metadata, dependencies, and setup configuration.\n   - There are no embedded executable code, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or privilege escalations.\n\n2. **Report Content and Validity:**\n   - All reports are marked as \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.\n   - This indicates that there are no details, findings, or claims made about vulnerabilities, malware, or issues in the reports.\n   - Since no information is provided, there's no basis to identify or confirm any security issues.\n\n3. **Error, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports lack content; thus, no logical flaws or mistakes can be identified.\n   - The absence of data suggests either a reporting failure or that no issues were found or reported.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Given the absence of any reported issues, the scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should all be low or zero.\n   - The code itself appears standard, with no indicators of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n   - The framework dependencies are common and well-maintained, assuming they are up-to-date.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - Without any actual report details, assumptions about vulnerabilities or malware are unwarranted.\n   - The code itself does not exhibit any suspicious behavior or code patterns.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - Since no issues are reported, and the code is straightforward, the malware score should be 0.\n   - Obfuscation does not appear to be present; the code is clear, so obfuscated score should be 0.\n   - The risk score should also be 0, reflecting no identified security concerns.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Confirm that the lack of report details is accurate and that no issues are present.\n- The scores should be:\n  - Malware score: **0**\n  - Obfuscated score: **0**\n  - Risk score: **0**\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the provided code and the empty reports, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The package appears to be a standard, well-structured setup script for a Python framework wrapper with no apparent vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
