  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports systematically.\n\n1. Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code:\n- The reports contain only \"Empty response\" errors, indicating no detailed information or identified issues. Based solely on the code snippet, there are no obvious vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or flaws. The code appears to be a standard wrapper setup for the MediaLibrary framework using PyObjC.\n\n2. Identify and record errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The code is straightforward and appears correct for its purpose. No logical errors, security flaws, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The only potential concern is that the code does not include any validation or security checks, but this is typical for such wrapper setup scripts.\n\n3. Review the scores given to each issue:\n- Since no issues are identified, scores should be minimal or zero.\n- The reports do not specify any scores, only errors related to empty responses.\n\n4. Justify any risk score higher than 0.5:\n- No issues are detected, so risk scores should be very low or zero.\n- Without evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity, assigning high risk scores is unjustified.\n\n5. Malware score considerations:\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing untrusted code, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- Therefore, malware scores should be zero.\n\n6. Challenge claims based on assumptions:\n- Since no specific claims are made, and the code is a standard setup script, there are no assumptions to challenge.\n\n7. Ensure score consistency:\n- Given the absence of issues, all scores should reflect a safe, benign setup.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is a standard setup script for a PyObjC framework wrapper.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The reports lack details, but based on the code, no issues exist.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- Malware score: 0.0\n- Obfuscated score: 0.0\n- Risk score: 0.0\n\n**Final note:**\n- The absence of detailed reports makes it impossible to identify hidden issues, but based on the code provided, it appears safe and correctly implemented.",
