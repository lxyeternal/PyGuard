  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'pyobjc-framework-MediaLibrary' package, defining dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, dependencies, and version information from the setup script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks; primarily static configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A - static setup script with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script for wrapping the macOS MediaLibrary framework via PyObjC. It contains no embedded executable code, network operations, or suspicious logic. The provided reports are empty, indicating no identified vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The dependencies are standard and versioned appropriately. Given the lack of any suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads, the code appears benign. The absence of detailed report content suggests no issues are present. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should all be minimal or zero, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is standard, with no evidence of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The empty reports do not indicate any issues. Therefore, the supply chain security posture is considered safe, with all risk scores at the lowest level.",
