{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the jupyter_black package, verifying notebook cell loading, formatting, configuration filtering, and magic command support.",
  "sources": "Standard test data within the test functions, including mock notebook cells and configuration options.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, external system interaction, or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "The code flows involve passing mock notebook cell data through functions and asserting formatting results, with no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite using standard libraries and mocks, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. It only verifies formatting behavior and configuration filtering. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected, and the code aligns with best practices for testing. The absence of external data handling or system modifications indicates a very low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All signals point to a safe, standard test suite. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
