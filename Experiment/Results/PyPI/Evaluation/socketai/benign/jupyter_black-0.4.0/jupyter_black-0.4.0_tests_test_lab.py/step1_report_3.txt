{
  "purpose": "The code provides test functions for a Jupyter notebook extension 'jupyter_black', focusing on formatting and magic commands within notebook cells.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'cells' list defining cell sources; 'source_from_cell' function extracts source code from output.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks involving untrusted data handling, network communication, or sensitive data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause security issues; test assertions focus on code formatting results.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script consists solely of test functions for formatting checks on Jupyter notebook cells. The code uses static input data and asserts expected output results. No untrusted inputs, external network calls, or security-sensitive operations are present. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malware are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for a notebook extension and does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe with no security concerns.",
