  "purpose": "Unit tests for the jupyter_black extension in Jupyter Lab, focusing on code formatting behavior.",
  "sources": "Input cells containing code or magic commands; output cells processed by the lab function.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input cells (sources) are processed by the 'lab' function, but no data flows to external sinks or unsafe operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward testing logic.",
  "analysis": "The script consists solely of test functions that simulate Jupyter notebook cells and verify code transformation behavior. There is no input validation, external data access, or code execution beyond simple test assertions. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard testing code for a Jupyter extension, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It performs input mockups and assertions without external interactions or unsafe operations.",
