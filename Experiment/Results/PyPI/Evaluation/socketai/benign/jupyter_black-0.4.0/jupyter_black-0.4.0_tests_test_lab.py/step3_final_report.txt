{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the 'jupyter_black' extension in Jupyter Lab, verifying code formatting behavior in notebook cells.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from hardcoded cell source lists and function parameters, with no external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations; the code only processes static test data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the predefined cell source lists through the 'lab' and 'source_from_cell' functions, resulting in formatted code assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static test functions that create mock notebook cells, invoke formatting functions, and verify output. There are no external data transmissions, dynamic code execution, or security-sensitive operations. The code is simple, readable, and intended for testing formatting behavior, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero. The code's straightforward nature and lack of suspicious patterns justify high confidence in its safety.",
