{
  "purpose": "The code provides test cases for a Jupyter Notebook extension or plugin called jupyter_black, which is likely used to auto-format Python code within Jupyter Lab notebooks.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'cells' list, specifically from the 'source' key in each cell, which contains code snippets or magic commands.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'source_from_cell' with the output, potentially using the content to verify or manipulate source code. No direct data sinks like network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input source code in cells -> processed by 'source_from_cell' -> assertions check transformed code for formatting changes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or secret data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test functions that prepare input cells, invoke a lab function, and verify output source code formatting. It uses standard Python data structures and assertions. No external or suspicious behaviors, malicious commands, or security risks are evident. The functions are straightforward test cases targeting code formatting functionality, with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate test code for a Jupyter Lab extension related to code formatting, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only reads static data, performs formatting assertions, and uses no external or potentially harmful operations.",
