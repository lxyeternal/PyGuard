  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code quality, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides pytest fixtures for testing Jupyter notebooks and JupyterLab via Playwright. It manages server processes with no tokens/passwords, interacts with local APIs, and handles notebook content creation and execution. No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Analysis:** All activities are typical for test automation. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious code.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (low, given server process initiation and network interactions are confined to localhost and are standard in testing)\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's intent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on Jupyter notebook testing, server setup, and kernel management. No suspicious credentials or obfuscation. Network interactions are local, subprocesses launch servers with blank tokens/passwords.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity detected; standard testing procedures.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a testing setup for Jupyter notebooks/labs, with server startup, notebook creation, and kernel management. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code. Uses subprocesses with minimal parameters.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious intent. The code is standard for test automation.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (very low, as expected)\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on decoding websocket messages, server setup, and notebook management. No secrets or obfuscation. The decode_event function processes messages in a straightforward manner.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; standard testing code.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with server setup, notebook creation, and event handling. No suspicious code or secrets.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (0). The code is for testing automation, not malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero but low, reflecting the use of subprocesses and network interactions confined to localhost, typical in test environments.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.  \n**Risk:** 0.2 — minor risk due to subprocess management and network interactions in a testing context, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured testing utility for Jupyter environments, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.",
