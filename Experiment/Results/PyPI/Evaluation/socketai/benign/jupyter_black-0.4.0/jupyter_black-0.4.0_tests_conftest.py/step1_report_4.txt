  "raw_response": "{\n  \"purpose\": \"This code provides pytest fixtures and utility functions for testing Jupyter notebooks and JupyterLab environments using Playwright, including server setup, notebook manipulation, and event handling.\",\n  \"sources\": \"Reads include file I/O (`nb.read_text()`, `nb.write_text()`), socket connections (to check server status), HTTP responses, WebSocket events, and JSON decoding from websocket messages.\",\n  \"sinks\": \"Potential sinks involve network requests/responses (e.g., `page.goto()`, `page.expect_response()`, `response.json()`, and socket connections), file writes (`nb.write_text()`), and subprocess management for launching servers.\",\n  \"flows\": \"Data flows from network and file I/O into JSON parsing, which feeds into event handling and server readiness checks. User-triggered actions (like clicks) lead to network requests, responses, and server shutdown commands.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"No hardcoded credentials or secret tokens; server tokens are set to empty strings. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Use of subprocess to launch Jupyter servers is standard but requires trust in the command parameters. The only minor point is the assumption of `\"/dev/null\"` as config file location, which might be platform-specific but not malicious.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code appears to be a typical testing setup for Jupyter notebooks/labs using Playwright, with functions to decode websocket messages, generate notebooks, control server instances, and monitor kernel events. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. Network communications are within localhost, used for testing purposes, and no sensitive credentials are hardcoded. The subprocess commands for starting Jupyter servers set token and password to empty strings, which is typical in testing environments and not suspicious. JSON decoding and server checks are straightforward, and no obfuscated code is present. Overall, the code functions as intended for testing without malicious intent.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is a well-structured testing utility for Jupyter environments with no indicators of malicious activity or sabotage. It uses standard techniques for server setup, event handling, and notebook manipulation, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.2\n}",
