  "purpose": "Unit tests for jupyter_black helper functions 'make_cell' and 'source_from_cell'.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; test functions use hardcoded data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Tests call helper functions with predefined data; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of test functions verifying the behavior of 'make_cell' and 'source_from_cell'. It uses static, hardcoded test data to check output values. There are no network operations, file I/O, or external dependencies that could be malicious. No source-to-sink data flows exist; the code is straightforward test logic. No anomalies, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be standard unit test code for helper functions, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, standard unit test suite with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
