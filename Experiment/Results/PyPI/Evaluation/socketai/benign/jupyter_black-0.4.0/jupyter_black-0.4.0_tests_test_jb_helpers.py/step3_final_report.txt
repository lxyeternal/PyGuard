  "purpose": "Unit tests for helper functions 'make_cell' and 'source_from_cell' operating on static in-memory data structures.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded cell data structures within test functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external I/O or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to internal function calls with static data; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns observed; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static unit tests manipulating in-memory data structures, with no external inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is standard testing code for internal helper functions, with all signals indicating benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All scores are appropriately set to 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
