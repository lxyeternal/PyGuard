{
  "purpose": "The code provides test functions for helpers related to Jupyter notebook cell manipulation, specifically testing 'make_cell' and 'source_from_cell' functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads test input data defined within the test functions, such as cell dictionaries and cell collections.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data or pass untrusted input to sensitive APIs or external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from test inputs through helper functions 'make_cell' and 'source_from_cell' to assertions, with no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard test code for helper functions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of test functions for two helper functions. It initializes data structures mimicking Jupyter cells, verifies their transformation, and asserts expected behaviors. No external input, no data leaks, no use of environment variables, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious code patterns are detected. The code strictly tests internal logic without any network or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite for helper functions related to Jupyter notebook cell management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code. It is safe and does not contain malware.",
