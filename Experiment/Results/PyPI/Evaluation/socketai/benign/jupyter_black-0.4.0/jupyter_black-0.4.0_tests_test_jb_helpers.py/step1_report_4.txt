  "purpose": "Unit tests for helper functions related to Jupyter notebook cell manipulation.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources; source data is defined within the test cases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or system effects; the code only performs data manipulation and assertions.",
  "flows": "Test data flows through helper functions, but no untrusted input processing or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains straightforward unit tests for functions make_cell and source_from_cell. It creates mock cell data, manipulates it, and verifies expected behavior via assertions. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no network activity, or any malicious behavior. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. It appears to be standard test code for helper functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is safe and serves as standard testing for helper functions with no malicious or security concerns detected.",
