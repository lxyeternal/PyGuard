{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for jupyter_black helper functions 'make_cell' and 'source_from_cell'.",
  "sources": "Input data to functions such as cell dictionaries and a collection of cells with IDs.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data processing present; functions mainly manipulate data structures.",
  "flows": "Input cell data -> make_cell or source_from_cell functions -> output data structures or source list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. No dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two test functions that create mock cell data structures and verify the behavior of helper functions. The tests check ID transformations and source extraction. The code strictly operates on predefined data structures and does not perform any input/output, network, or file operations. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be standard unit test code for code that manipulates Jupyter Notebook cell structures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for testing helper functions with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It contains no external dependencies or suspicious activities. Overall, it is safe and benign.",
