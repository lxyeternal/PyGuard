{
  "purpose": "The code is a Jupyter extension that formats code cells using the black formatter for improved readability.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration settings from pyproject.toml, user input via Jupyter cells, and optional parameters passed to the load function.",
  "sinks": "Formatted code replaces the original cell content. No external untrusted data is transmitted or stored.",
  "flows": "Configuration settings are retrieved and processed to create a black.Mode object; user code in cells is retrieved, formatted, and then replaced.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code is present. The code relies on standard libraries, black, and IPython APIs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a formatter class with black configuration, which can include target Python versions and line length. It registers a callback to format code cells before execution, replacing cell content with formatted code. Configuration is loaded from pyproject.toml or passed parameters. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are observed. Use of standard APIs and libraries suggests legitimate code formatting functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate Jupyter extension designed to format code cells using black. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the analysis of the provided source. No suspicious signals detected.",
