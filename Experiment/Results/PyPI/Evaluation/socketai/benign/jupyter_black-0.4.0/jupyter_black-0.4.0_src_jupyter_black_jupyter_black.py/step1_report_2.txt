{
  "purpose": "The code implements an IPython extension to automatically format Jupyter notebook cells using the 'black' code formatter.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from pyproject.toml and function parameters; accesses IPython shell and cell content; registers event handlers.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'black.format_cell' to reformat code; potentially replaces cell input with formatted code.",
  "flows": "Source: configuration and cell content -> black.format_cell -> sink: replace cell input with formatted code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration; no use of unsafe code execution or system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and 'black' for formatting. It defines a formatter class that configures 'black' based on pyproject.toml and user parameters, then applies formatting to cells before execution. The extension registers and unregisters event handlers within IPython. The logic is straightforward, focusing solely on code formatting; no external data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate IPython extension for beautifying code cells using 'black'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility for code formatting enhancement.",
