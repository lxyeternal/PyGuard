{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Jupyter Notebook extension that formats code cells using the 'black' formatter, enhancing code readability and consistency.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from pyproject.toml and cell content via IPython APIs.",
  "sinks": "Replaces the current cell input with formatted code using IPython's set_next_input method.",
  "flows": "Cell raw content is retrieved, formatted with black, and then replaced in the notebook interface.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a formatter with configuration from pyproject.toml or parameters, registers a pre-execution hook to format cells, and handles exceptions safely. It uses standard APIs and libraries without any malicious or suspicious patterns. No external communication or obfuscation is present, and the logic is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign Jupyter extension for automatic code formatting. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting its safe, local-only operation.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
