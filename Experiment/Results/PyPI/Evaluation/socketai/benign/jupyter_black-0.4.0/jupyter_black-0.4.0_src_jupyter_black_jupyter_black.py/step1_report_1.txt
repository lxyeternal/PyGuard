{
  "purpose": "This code provides an extension for Jupyter Notebook to automatically format code cells using the Black code formatter, with configurable options loaded from pyproject.toml or passed directly.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files (pyproject.toml), IPython shell state, and cell content via ExecutionInfo.raw_cell.",
  "sinks": "Formats cell code with black.format_cell, which outputs formatted code back into the IPython input buffer.",
  "flows": "Cell content is fetched as raw_cell, passed to black.format_cell, and the formatted code replaces the original cell input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. Use of exception handling is standard for formatting errors. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a formatter with configuration loaded from pyproject.toml or supplied options, then registers a pre-run hook to format cells before execution. It safely handles exceptions during formatting, ensuring no malicious side effects. The extension provides mechanisms to load and unload cleanly, with no suspicious network or file operations beyond standard config parsing. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. It primarily manipulates code formatting in a local, controlled manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Jupyter Notebook extension designed to improve code readability via Black formatting. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on its content. The implementation is straightforward, and no suspicious signals are detected.",
