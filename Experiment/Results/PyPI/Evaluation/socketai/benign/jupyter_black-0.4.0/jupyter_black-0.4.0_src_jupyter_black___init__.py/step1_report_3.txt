  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; reexport is straightforward",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that sets version, author info, and reexports functions from a local module `.jupyter_black`. There is no data processing, external communication, or suspicious code patterns. It appears to be a standard module reexport with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module re-export with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
