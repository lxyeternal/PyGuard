  "purpose": "Re-export modules from jupyter_black for easier access and to define package metadata.",
  "sources": "Module import statements, package metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __email__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input; mainly module re-exporting and metadata",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; code only defines exports and metadata",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata and re-exports specific functions from a submodule. It does not include any dynamic code execution, input handling, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior are present. The import statement is standard, and the re-export pattern is common in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and serves as a straightforward module re-export with metadata. No malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation are detected.",
