{
  "purpose": "Reexport used modules; main code is in `jupyter_black.py` for Jupyter notebook integration.",
  "sources": "Module imports from .jupyter_black and module metadata (__version__, __author__, __email__).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data flows to external systems or untrusted outputs.",
  "flows": "Imports from local module to exported symbols; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets are present, no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reexports specific functions from a local module, defines metadata, and exports them for external use. No external inputs are processed; no dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears straightforward and intentionally minimal, serving as an interface for the main implementation elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module re-export with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any malware or suspicious activities, and the structure is typical for a Python package interface.",
