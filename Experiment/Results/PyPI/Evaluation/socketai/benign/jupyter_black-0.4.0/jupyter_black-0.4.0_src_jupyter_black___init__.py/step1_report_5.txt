{
  "purpose": "Reexport used modules; the main implementation is in 'jupyter_black.py'.",
  "sources": "Module imports from '.jupyter_black' and metadata assignments (__version__, __author__, __email__).",
  "sinks": "No clear sink points for untrusted data or external outputs within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports and metadata assignments do not involve data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code simply reexports functions and sets metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata and reexports specific functions from a local module '.jupyter_black'. It does not execute any external commands, handle user input, or access environment variables. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The code's structure is straightforward, serving as an index or initializer for a package.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple reexporter and metadata holder with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a standard package interface setup.",
