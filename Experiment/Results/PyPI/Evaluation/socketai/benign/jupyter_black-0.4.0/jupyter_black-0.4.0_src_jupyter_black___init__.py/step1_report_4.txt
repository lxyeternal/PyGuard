{
  "purpose": "Reexport used modules for a Jupyter Notebook extension, with main code in a separate file.",
  "sources": "Module import from .jupyter_black",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks identified",
  "flows": "Importing functions from the internal module to make them available externally",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines metadata (__version__, __author__, __email__) and reexports functions from a local module (.jupyter_black). It imports functions load, load_ipython_extension, and unload_ipython_extension, then exposes them via __all__. There are no input sources, no data processing, no network calls, and no suspicious behavior observed. The code serves as a straightforward module re-export pattern, common in Python packages for modularity and organization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module re-export with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It contains no obfuscated code, no sensitive information, and no malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal.",
