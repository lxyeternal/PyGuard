  "purpose": "Utility functions for processing text, emojis, and data formatting",
  "sources": "Input parameters of functions (text, data, indices, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; functions process data and return results without external effects",
  "flows": "Input data flows through functions, processed locally, and results are returned without external communication",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden code; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation; functions perform standard data processing tasks",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three functions: count_emojis, find_longest_contiguous_strings, and split_list_by_indices. All functions perform safe, well-defined data processing tasks such as counting emojis within specified Unicode ranges, finding maximum string lengths separated by delimiters, and splitting lists at specified indices. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or code injection. The emoji detection correctly handles surrogate pairs and keycap sequences without misuse. The string analysis functions operate purely on input data with no external interactions. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or obfuscated segments. Overall, the code appears to be standard utility functions with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is safe, performing typical data processing tasks related to emojis and string analysis. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The functions are straightforward and do not interact with external systems or perform any suspicious operations.",
