  "purpose": "Utility functions for emoji counting, string analysis, and list splitting.",
  "sources": "Text input for emoji detection; list of dictionaries for string length analysis; list of indices for splitting.",
  "sinks": "None; functions process data internally without external effects.",
  "flows": "Input text processed to identify emojis; data analyzed for maximum string lengths; list split at specified indices.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Unicode range checks for emojis, handles surrogate pairs and keycap sequences correctly, and processes data for string length and list splitting. All functions are straightforward, with no external system interaction, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation. The logic is clear and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It functions as intended for data processing tasks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (0 or 0.1) reflects the minimal threat posed by these utilities, which are safe in isolation.",
