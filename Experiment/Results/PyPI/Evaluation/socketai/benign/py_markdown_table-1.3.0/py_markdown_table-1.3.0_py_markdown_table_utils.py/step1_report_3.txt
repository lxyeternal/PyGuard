  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for emoji counting, finding longest contiguous strings, and splitting lists, intended for external use in text processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments: 'text' string for 'count_emojis', 'data' list of dicts for 'find_longest_contiguous_strings', and 'lst' & 'indices' lists for 'split_list_by_indices'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data to perform sensitive operations or system calls. Functions only perform data analysis and list manipulations without external effects.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters to internal logic; no untrusted data is used in any dangerous context or external system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward with no obfuscated code, hidden logic, or suspicious constructs. Emoji detection handles surrogate pairs and keycap sequences properly. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform standard text and list manipulations: counting emojis in a string based on Unicode ranges, determining maximum contiguous string lengths within data, and splitting lists at specified indices. All operations are within normal bounds of data processing. No external calls, system modifications, or security-sensitive operations are present. No signs of malicious intent or malware behavior. Implementation appears safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for emoji counting, string analysis, and list splitting with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs data processing with no external side effects or dangerous operations.",
