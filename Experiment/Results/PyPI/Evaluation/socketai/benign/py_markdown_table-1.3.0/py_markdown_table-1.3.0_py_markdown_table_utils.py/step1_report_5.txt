  "purpose": "Utility functions for emoji processing and data manipulation, including counting emojis in text, finding longest contiguous strings in data, and splitting lists by indices.",
  "sources": "The functions read input parameters such as strings (text), lists of dictionaries (data), and indices (lists).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that perform data leaks, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions and produces processed outputs; no external data or untrusted sources are directly utilized that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious network activities are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data processing tasks: counting emojis in text with recognition of surrogate pairs and keycap sequences, determining maximum string lengths per data column, and splitting lists at specified indices. The emoji range checks are comprehensive but straightforward. No external system calls, network access, or credential handling are present. The functions operate on provided data without side effects or security-sensitive operations. The overall structure appears benign and intended for formatting or display purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains utility functions for emoji analysis and data handling with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and suitable for inclusion in larger projects.",
