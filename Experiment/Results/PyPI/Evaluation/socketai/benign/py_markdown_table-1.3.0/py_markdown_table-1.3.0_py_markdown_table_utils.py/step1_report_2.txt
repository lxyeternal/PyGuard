  "purpose": "Utility functions for emoji detection, string analysis, and list splitting, likely used in text processing or UI rendering.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as text strings, lists of dictionaries, and index lists.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data leading to vulnerabilities; functions are mainly data processing utilities.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed to identify emojis, calculate maximum string lengths, and split lists; no untrusted data is directed to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and procedural.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform standard operations: counting emojis with consideration for surrogate pairs and keycap sequences; determining maximum contiguous string lengths per dictionary key; splitting lists based on indices. All operations are safe and do not interact with external systems, network, or sensitive resources. No obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for text and list processing without malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and intended for straightforward data handling.",
