  "obfuscated": 0.75,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts. While explicit malicious payloads are not confirmed in all reports, the presence of eval()/exec() with untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, and suspicious network activity warrants a high security concern. The overall malware score is set at 0.75, obfuscation at 0.75, and risk at 0.8, reflecting a high probability of malicious intent and potential supply chain compromise."
