  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, considering the code and the provided assessments.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a Python class for generating markdown tables with extensive customization.\n- They emphasize the absence of malicious behaviors, network activity, obfuscation, or external data leaks.\n- The reports highlight that the code performs data validation, formatting, and string processing, with no signs of malware, sabotage, or supply chain threats.\n- The utility functions `count_emojis` and `split_list_by_indices` are external but presumed safe, used for emoji counting and list splitting.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9+), and all assign malware scores of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validity Checks:\n\n**Are the reported issues present in the code?**\n- The reports state that the code is benign, with no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. This aligns with the code review, which shows standard data validation and string formatting operations.\n- No evidence of code injection, external command execution, or network activity is observed.\n- The utility functions are external but used appropriately; no suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**\n- The reports are consistent and do not contain logical errors or misinterpretations.\n- They correctly identify the code's purpose and its safe, standard operations.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities that are unsupported by the code analysis.\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, which seems appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are also low, mostly 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1, which is justified by the benign nature of the code.\n- No suspicious patterns or behaviors are identified that would warrant higher scores.\n\n**Malware score justification:**\n- The code does not perform any network activity, code injection, or external command execution.\n- External utility functions are used safely, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The code is purely for formatting and data validation.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions?**\n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on code structure and known behavior.\n\n**Score consistency:**\n- All assessments are consistent with the code's functionality and security posture.\n\n---\n\n### Final Step: Overall Estimation\n\n**Malware score:**\n- The code is safe; no malware detected.\n- **Estimated malware score: 0**\n\n**Obfuscated score:**\n- The code is clear, well-structured, with no obfuscation.\n- **Estimated obfuscated score: 0**\n\n**Risk score:**\n- Given the absence of malicious activity, external threats, or vulnerabilities, a low risk score is appropriate.\n- Slightly above zero only if considering potential misconfigurations, but none are evident.\n- **Estimated risk score: 0.1**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, the reports' assessments are accurate and align with the code's behavior. The code is a standard, safe utility for markdown table generation with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain threats.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the benign, well-structured nature of the code and the lack of any malicious or suspicious activity.",
