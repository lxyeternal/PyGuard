  "purpose": "A Python class for generating formatted markdown tables with various customization options.",
  "sources": "Initialization (__init__) method, set_params method, internal validation methods, and data processing functions that read data from the 'data' parameter and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not write data to external systems, execute system commands, or handle untrusted input beyond internal data validation.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated, processed for formatting and styling, then used to generate markdown table components. Data flows from input to internal attributes and ultimately to output markdown string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard library functions and does not perform network activity, file manipulation, or system commands. No obfuscated or intentionally misleading code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data validation, formatting calculations, and string manipulations to produce markdown tables. It includes extensive parameter validation to ensure correct input types and values. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system tampering. The processing of data is contained within the class without external side effects. All data is processed internally, and the output is a markdown string, optionally wrapped in markdown code fences. The code adheres to typical formatting and structure for such a utility class, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility class for rendering markdown tables with flexible options. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The implementation appears safe, standard, and focused on formatting and validation tasks.",
