  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently state that the code is a benign, well-structured utility for generating markdown tables.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external threats are identified.\n- The reports emphasize that the code performs data validation, formatting, and string manipulation solely for presentation purposes.\n- The utility functions 'count_emojis' and 'split_list_by_indices' are external but are presumed safe, used for emoji counting and list splitting.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.95 or 1), indicating strong agreement that the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and logically consistent.\n- **Malware presence:** No malware or malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.\n- **External interactions:** No network calls, file I/O, or command executions.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No evidence of injection, data leaks, or unsafe operations.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The code relies on external utility functions, but their implementation isn't provided. If these functions are malicious or insecure, that could pose a risk, but based on their usage, they seem safe.\n- The data validation is thorough, but the code does not sanitize string content beyond length and type checks. However, since the output is markdown, injection risks are minimal unless the markdown renderer interprets malicious content, which is outside the scope here.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, mostly due to reliance on external utility functions; no active threats)\n\n### Specific Points:\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0** since there's no malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at **0**.\n- The **risk score** could be marginally increased to 0.1 or 0.2 to account for external utility functions, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a straightforward markdown table generator with extensive validation.\n- No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.\n- External utility functions are presumed safe, but their unknown implementation slightly elevates risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe supply chain risk from this code appears negligible. It is a standard utility with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The minor risk score reflects the dependency on external utility functions, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more conservative or aggressive scoring approach.",
