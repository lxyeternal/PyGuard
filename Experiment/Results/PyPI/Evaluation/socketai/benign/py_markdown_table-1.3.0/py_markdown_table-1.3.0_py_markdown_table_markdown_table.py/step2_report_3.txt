  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, focusing on the core concerns: presence of malicious code, obfuscation, and security risks.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a class for generating markdown tables with extensive customization options.\n- They highlight that the code reads input data, performs validation, and formats strings for markdown output.\n- No report detects hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, network activity, file I/O, or external command execution.\n- The utility functions `count_emojis` and `split_list_by_indices` are external but used in a manner consistent with safe emoji processing and list splitting.\n- The overall tone is that the code is a benign, well-structured utility with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- **Malware:** No, none of the reports find evidence of malicious code, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** No, the code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard Python idioms.\n- **Security Risks:** None identified beyond normal data validation. No external system calls or network operations are present.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports do not identify any logical flaws that would suggest security issues or malicious behavior.\n- The code’s data validation and formatting routines are standard and do not pose security concerns.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code’s clarity.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or very close to it, which is justified.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- No issues warrant a risk score above 0.5. The code is a straightforward markdown table generator with no malicious features.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores across reports are consistent and justified based on the provided analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese scores align with the detailed reviews.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the detailed reports and the code review:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a safe, standard utility for markdown table rendering with no security concerns or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and performs as intended without any signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The provided scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a risk score of zero.",
