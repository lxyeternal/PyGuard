{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python class for generating formatted markdown tables from provided data, supporting various customization options.",
  "sources": "Data input via constructor parameter 'data' (list of dictionaries); internal methods reading class attributes; optional external modules imported from 'py_markdown_table.utils'.",
  "sinks": "Methods that generate markdown string output, including get_markdown, get_header, get_body, and internal formatting functions; no direct data sink such as network or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor initialization -> parameter validation -> formatting functions -> output string in get_markdown; no external untrusted data sources or network operations involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns detected. The code's structure is standard for a markdown table generator; no dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a markdown table generator with customizable formatting parameters. It performs input validation, formatting, and string concatenation to produce markdown syntax. The imported utility functions are presumed safe and are used for counting emojis and splitting lists, with no indications of malicious intent. The class methods do not perform any network activity, file I/O, or external command execution. All data manipulations are contained within the class, purely for formatting and string processing. There are no signs of malicious behaviors or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard utility class for rendering markdown tables from data. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It relies on external safe utility functions and performs no harmful operations.",
