  "purpose": "A Python class for generating formatted markdown tables with extensive customization options, including validation and multiline support.",
  "sources": "Input data dictionaries, external utility functions 'count_emojis' and 'split_list_by_indices' for emoji counting and list splitting.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network or file I/O, no code execution or external command calls.",
  "flows": "Data is validated, processed for formatting, and converted into markdown string output; external functions process emoji counts and string splits.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; external utility functions are used in a benign manner; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured utility for markdown table rendering, performing data validation, string formatting, and optional multiline handling. It does not perform network activity, code injection, or external system calls. External functions are used for emoji counting and string splitting, presumed safe. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. Validation routines are thorough, and the code's purpose is solely formatting, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented markdown table generator with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. External utility functions are presumed safe, and the overall security posture is very high. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal external dependency considerations.",
