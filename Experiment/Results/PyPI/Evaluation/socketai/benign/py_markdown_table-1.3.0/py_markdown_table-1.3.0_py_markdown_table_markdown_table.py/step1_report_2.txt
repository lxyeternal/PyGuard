{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to generate formatted markdown tables from input data, supporting various customization options for appearance and layout.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'data' parameter during class initialization; configuration parameters are set via the 'set_params' method; data validation and processing occur in private methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly contain sinks that send data over the network, write to files, or execute untrusted code. It primarily processes and formats data for display.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input 'data' parameter into internal methods for validation, padding calculation, and row/column generation. Formatted markdown string is generated and optionally wrapped in code block quotes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or misleading variable names are detected. The code performs standard data formatting without hidden functions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a class to produce markdown tables with extensive customization. It validates input data, configures rendering parameters, calculates padding, and constructs markdown strings. No network or system manipulation, no file or environment variable access, or execution of untrusted code is observed. The logic appears focused on formatting and rendering, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation for generating markdown tables with configurable styling. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for data formatting purposes.",
