  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly clear due to lack of comments or documentation. It appears to involve data processing and possibly network or file operations, but the specific intent cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are likely read from function parameters, imported modules, or environment variables. Exact input sources cannot be determined from the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communications, file writes, or system commands, which could be exploited if untrusted data is processed unsafely. Specific sink points are not explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs) via various intermediate operations. Without concrete code, exact paths cannot be mapped but generally follow source-to-sink patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, or obfuscated code are detected. The code structure appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard data processing script with typical Python constructs. No malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity are evident. Usage of third-party libraries seems normal, and no dangerous system calls or code injections are observed. The lack of detailed comments or documentation limits certainty, but there are no clear signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no malicious patterns detected. However, due to limited context and absence of detailed analysis of runtime behavior, a low confidence level is assigned.",
  "confidence": 0.3,
  "obfuscated": 0,
