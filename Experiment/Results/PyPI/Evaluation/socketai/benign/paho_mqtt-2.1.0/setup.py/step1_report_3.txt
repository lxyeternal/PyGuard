{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that performs a basic task, such as reading input, processing data, or executing commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from user prompts, environment variables, or external files.",
  "sinks": "The code executes system commands, writes data to files, or sends data over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) into processing functions, then to sinks (e.g., system calls, network transmission).",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, dynamic execution via eval or exec, hardcoded credentials, or unusual import statements. Any code that appears to hide intent or obscure data flows.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step review shows the code utilizes standard Python features with straightforward data handling. No evidence of obfuscated code or hidden malicious logic. The code does not perform network operations, file manipulations, or system modifications that suggest malicious intent. Usage of third-party libraries is not inherently suspicious. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns. The flow of data appears normal, originating from inputs and processed locally without external communication. Overall, the code looks benign based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not show signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard script with no malicious intent. However, this conclusion is based solely on the code provided and not on external context.",
