  "purpose": "Manage MQTT topic filters with support for wildcards using a prefix tree (trie).",
  "sources": "Input topic strings in methods like __setitem__, __getitem__, __delitem__, and iter_match.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or system calls, no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input topic strings are split and traversed through trie nodes; match function recursively yields associated values.",
  "anomalies": "Incomplete delete method does not fully remove nodes, but this is a functional issue, not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard MQTT filter trie with add, retrieve, delete, and match functionalities. It handles wildcards '+' and '#' appropriately during matching. No external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The delete method only clears node content without fully removing nodes, which could lead to memory issues but not security vulnerabilities. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with MQTT specifications. The security and malware scores are correctly low, reflecting no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an MQTT topic filter trie with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities. The minor incomplete delete logic does not pose a security threat. The existing security risk scores are appropriate, and malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero.",
