  "purpose": "Defines a version string and a custom exception class for MQTT-related errors.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; only a version string and class definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data handling or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only declares constants and a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class and variable declaration, no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a version string and a simple custom exception class named 'MQTTException'. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no potential sink points for malicious activity. The exception class is a standard Python subclass with no additional logic or dangerous behavior. Overall, the code appears to serve a minimal, benign purpose, likely part of a larger MQTT client or module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is harmless, containing only a version identifier and a basic custom exception class with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
