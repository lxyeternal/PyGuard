  "purpose": "Define a version string and a custom exception class for MQTT-related errors.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' and the class 'MQTTException' inheriting from Exception.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is purely definitional with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple version identifier and a custom exception class, with no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are present, and the code serves as boilerplate for a larger MQTT client library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, straightforward, and poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
