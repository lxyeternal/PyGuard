  "flows": "There are no data flows involving sources and sinks in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no unusual or suspicious constructs. The version string is a common practice and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and a custom exception class for MQTT errors. It contains no input/output operations, no dynamic code, and no malicious constructs. It is a simple, benign snippet likely part of a larger MQTT client library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is harmless and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, minimal implementation component.",
