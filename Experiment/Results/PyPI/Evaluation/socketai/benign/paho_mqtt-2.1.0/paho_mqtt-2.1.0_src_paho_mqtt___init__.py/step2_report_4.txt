  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code snippet contains:\n     ```python\n     __version__ = \"2.1.0\"\n\n     class MQTTException(Exception):\n         pass\n     ```\n   - It defines a version string and a custom exception class, both straightforward and minimal.\n\n2. **Presence of Reported Issues:**\n   - All reports agree that there are no external data sources, sinks, or data flows.\n   - No suspicious or malicious constructs are present.\n   - The code appears to be boilerplate or part of a larger MQTT client library.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The assessments are appropriately cautious, emphasizing the benign nature.\n\n4. **Score Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score (0):** Correct, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - **Malware Score (0):** Correct, no malicious behavior or code.\n   - **Security Risk Score (0):** Correct, the code is harmless and purely definitional.\n   - The reports' scores are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - The code itself does not contain vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n   - Since it's just a version string and an exception class, it cannot be exploited directly.\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a minimal, benign component likely used as part of a larger MQTT client library.\n   - No modifications or higher risk scores are warranted based on this fragment.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n- No further action needed; the code is safe.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is harmless, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
