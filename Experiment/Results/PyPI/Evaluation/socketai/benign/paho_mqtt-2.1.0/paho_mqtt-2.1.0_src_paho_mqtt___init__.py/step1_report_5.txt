  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for MQTT-related errors",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in this code",
  "sinks": "No sink points where untrusted data could lead to security issues",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this code snippet",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; the code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and defines a custom exception class. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no external calls or dynamic code execution. The exception class is simple and does not contain any malicious or suspicious code. Overall, the code appears to be boilerplate setup code for a larger project without any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to declare a version identifier and a custom exception class. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
