  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for MQTT-related errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows, input-to-output or otherwise, in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple class definition and version string.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and defines a custom exception class 'MQTTException' inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. Both are straightforward and typical for a Python package setup. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The exception class is empty and serves as a specific error type, which is common practice. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign part of a larger package, providing version information and a custom exception class with no malicious intent.",
