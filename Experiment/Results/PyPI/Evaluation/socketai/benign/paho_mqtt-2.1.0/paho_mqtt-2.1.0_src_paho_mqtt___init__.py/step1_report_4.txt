  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for MQTT-related errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading points present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points in the code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a version string and defines a custom exception class for MQTT errors. Both are standard, minimal, and do not involve any data processing, external inputs, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely definitional with no malicious intent or security concerns. It simply sets a version identifier and a custom exception class, both of which are common in Python modules.",
