{
  "purpose": "Define various enumerations related to MQTT protocol, callback API versions, message types, log levels, connection states, message states, and client modes for use in an MQTT client library.",
  "sources": "Enumeration definitions and class constants, all of which are static code declarations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; these are static enum definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists of straightforward enum classes with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of enum class definitions used to categorize various MQTT-related constants and statuses. No input reading, data processing, or external data handling occurs. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior are present. The structure and content are typical for a protocol library. The docstrings clarify usage and versioning, which is standard. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of static enum definitions intended for use in an MQTT client library. It appears safe and free from malicious intent or security risks. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors.",
