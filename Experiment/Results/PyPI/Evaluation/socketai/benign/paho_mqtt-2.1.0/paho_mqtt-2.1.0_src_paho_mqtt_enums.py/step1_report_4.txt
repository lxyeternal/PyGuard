  "purpose": "Define various enumerations related to MQTT protocol operations, error codes, message types, logging levels, connection states, and client modes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; the code solely defines enums.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or external data processing are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; this code only declares constants and enums.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining enumerations for various MQTT protocol aspects. It includes documentation comments and standard enum usage without dynamic code execution or data handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are apparent. The enums serve as constants for protocol implementation and are typical in network protocol libraries.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely defining constants for MQTT protocol operations. It does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be part of a standard MQTT client library implementation.",
