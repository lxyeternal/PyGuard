  "purpose": "Define MQTT protocol constants, error codes, message types, log levels, connection states, message states, and client modes as static enumerations for use within an MQTT client library.",
  "sources": "Static enum definitions; no external input or data reading involved.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted data or perform data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static definitions used as constants within other code modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward enum declarations with documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static enum classes defining constants for MQTT protocol operations, error codes, message types, log levels, connection states, message states, and client modes. There are no functions, data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code is well-structured, documented, and uses standard Python enum constructs. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified given the benign static nature of the code. The high confidence scores (1) reflect certainty that the code is safe and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of enum definitions serving as protocol constants for an MQTT client library. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
