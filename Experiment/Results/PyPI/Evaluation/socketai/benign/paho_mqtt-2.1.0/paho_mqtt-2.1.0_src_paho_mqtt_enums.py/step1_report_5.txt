  "purpose": "Define enumerations for MQTT protocol error codes, message types, log levels, connection states, and client modes used in a Python MQTT client library.",
  "sources": "Import of enum module; enumeration class definitions; class docstrings and comments.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources, external inputs, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations; primarily static enum definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions for various MQTT protocol-related constants. No input handling, network operations, or external data processing occurs. Comments provide documentation, but no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The structure and formatting are standard for Python enumeration definitions. No indicators of malware or malicious intent are present. The code appears to be a straightforward, benign set of definitions for use within an MQTT client implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of enumeration class definitions for MQTT protocol constants and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
