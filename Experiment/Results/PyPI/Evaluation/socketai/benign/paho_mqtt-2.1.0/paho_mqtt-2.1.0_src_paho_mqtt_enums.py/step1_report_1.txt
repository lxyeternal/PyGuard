{
  "purpose": "Define various enums related to MQTT protocol, callback versions, message types, log levels, connection states, message states, and client modes for an MQTT client library.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions and constant assignments; no external data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points that handle untrusted data or sensitive information.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; enums are static definitions used for internal logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a straightforward set of enum definitions for protocol constants.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum definitions for MQTT protocol error codes, message types, log levels, connection statuses, and client modes. There are no functions, data handling, or external input processing. The enums are used for protocol state management and do not contain or execute any malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or network operations are present. The structure is clear, and the code serves as a foundation for an MQTT client library. No security issues or malicious intent identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of enum definitions for MQTT protocol handling. It contains no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and intended for internal protocol management within an MQTT client library.",
