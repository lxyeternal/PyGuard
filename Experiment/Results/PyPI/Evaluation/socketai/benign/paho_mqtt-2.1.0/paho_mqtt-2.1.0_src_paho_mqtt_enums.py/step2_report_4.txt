  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of enum definitions related to MQTT protocol constants, error codes, message types, log levels, connection states, message states, and client modes. There are no functions, data handling, external input processing, or network operations.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**:  \n   The reports uniformly state that no anomalies, malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is static, straightforward, and intended for internal protocol management.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Malware**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. The security risk score is also 0, indicating no identified vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:  \n   The scores assigned are consistent and reasonable:\n   - Malware: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n   - Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n   - Security risk: 0 (no vulnerabilities or risky behavior identified)\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions**:  \n   The reports correctly challenge any claims of vulnerabilities based solely on enum definitions. Since no dynamic code, external data, or sensitive information handling exists, the risk of malicious activity is negligible.\n\n6. **Conclusion & Recommendations**:  \n   The code is a benign, standard set of enum definitions for an MQTT client library. It is well-structured, documented, and free from security issues or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**These scores accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent and justified. The code is a straightforward, safe set of enum definitions with no security risks or malicious intent. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.",
