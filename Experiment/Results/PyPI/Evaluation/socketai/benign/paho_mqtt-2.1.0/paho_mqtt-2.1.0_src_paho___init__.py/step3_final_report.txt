  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, external modules, user inputs, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writing, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via function calls, data processing routines, or network requests.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, inconsistent confidence scores in absence of code, potential overestimation of confidence in no-code reports.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify presence or absence of code. Reports with code show benign behavior, no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Scores are generally consistent; confidence levels are high where code exists, and low where code is absent. The malware scores are zero across all reports, aligning with the benign assessments. Security risk scores are low, reflecting minimal concern. The only inconsistency is in Report 5, where confidence is set to 1 despite no code being present; this should be lowered to better match the lack of analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are accurate and appropriately scored, with minor adjustments needed for confidence scores in reports lacking code. Overall, the dependency appears benign with no malicious indicators detected.",
