  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the 'awslogs' package using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "The line 'metadata.version(\"awslogs\")' reads the installed package metadata for 'awslogs'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data outputs; the code only assigns a value to __version__.",
  "flows": "The code fetches metadata.version('awslogs') and assigns it to __version__, with no further data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, using standard library functions without obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'metadata' module from 'importlib' and uses it to obtain the version of the 'awslogs' package installed in the environment. This is a common pattern in Python packages for version management. No user input, network calls, or suspicious logic are present. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign snippet to retrieve package version information. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
