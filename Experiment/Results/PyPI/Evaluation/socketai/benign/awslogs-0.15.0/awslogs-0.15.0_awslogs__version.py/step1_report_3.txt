  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'awslogs' package installed in the environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads the installed package metadata using importlib.metadata.version for 'awslogs'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted data; the code only reads package metadata.",
  "flows": "The code reads package version info from local environment and assigns it to __version__ variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a straightforward metadata retrieval without any suspicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'metadata' module from 'importlib' and calls 'metadata.version' with 'awslogs'. This is a standard method to obtain the installed version of a package. No input from untrusted sources, no data leaks, no suspicious behavior. The operation is simple and legitimate, serving likely for version tracking or compatibility checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard practice for version retrieval, and contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
