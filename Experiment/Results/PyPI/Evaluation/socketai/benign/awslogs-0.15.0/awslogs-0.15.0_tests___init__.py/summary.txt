  "obfuscated": 0.1,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 1's suspicion score of 0.4 and risk score of 0.55 are justified given the described dynamic execution and network activity. Other reports are correctly scored as benign or inconclusive. Overall, the dependency does not exhibit confirmed malicious behavior but warrants cautious monitoring of Report 1. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and no further adjustments are necessary."
