  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some form of data processing or utility functions based on the structure.",
  "sources": "Input is read from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to output functions, possibly written to files or network connections, or used in subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input parameters to sinks like output functions or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No signs of obfuscated or dynamically generated code. No malicious network calls or file manipulations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with clear variable usage. It reads environment variables and parameters, processes data, and outputs or returns results. There are no suspicious imports, no use of unsafe functions, and no evident malicious logic. The absence of obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hidden backdoors suggests a benign script. The code does not contain any anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unconventional language features that could indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears benign and safe to use.",
