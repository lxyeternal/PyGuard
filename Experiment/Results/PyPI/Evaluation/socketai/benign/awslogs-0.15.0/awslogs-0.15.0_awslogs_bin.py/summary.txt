  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured CLI utility for AWS CloudWatch Logs with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to handling user inputs and environment variables, which is standard. The masking of credentials during exceptions is a good security practice. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy."
