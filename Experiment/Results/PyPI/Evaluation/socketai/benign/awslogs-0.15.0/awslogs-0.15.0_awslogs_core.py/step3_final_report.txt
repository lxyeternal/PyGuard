  "purpose": "A utility for interacting with AWS CloudWatch logs, including listing log groups/streams, filtering, and streaming logs with optional querying and formatting.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for AWS credentials, log group/stream names, filter patterns, and datetime filters; external AWS API responses.",
  "sinks": "stdout where logs are printed; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> AWS SDK API calls -> processing responses -> formatted output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard AWS CloudWatch logs utility, using boto3 and botocore for API interactions, with proper exception handling and credential management via parameters. It performs log listing, filtering, timestamp parsing, and output formatting. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The only potential concern is printing logs directly, which could expose sensitive data if logs contain secrets, but this is typical for log viewing tools. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk. All reports are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign AWS CloudWatch logs utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
