  "purpose": "Internal version consistency check within the 'awslogs' package to ensure module versions match.",
  "sources": "Import statements for awslogs.bin, awslogs.core, awslogs._version; access to __version__ attributes.",
  "sinks": "Assertion comparing version strings; no external data or untrusted sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> access __version__ attributes -> compare values via assert statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version check with no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules and asserts that their __version__ attributes are equal, serving as a simple internal consistency check. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or execute any dynamic code. The code is clear, standard, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign internal version check with no malicious or security concerns. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
