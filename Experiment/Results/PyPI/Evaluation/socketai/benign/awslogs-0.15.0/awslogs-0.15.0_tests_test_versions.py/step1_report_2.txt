  "purpose": "The code tests whether the __version__ attribute in awslogs.bin matches the __version__ attribute in awslogs._version.",
  "sources": "Accessing __version__ attributes within imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs; purely internal attribute comparison.",
  "flows": "Accesses __version__ in awslogs.bin and awslogs._version; compares them.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules from awslogs and performs a simple assertion to verify version consistency. No external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior are present. The purpose appears to be a straightforward version consistency check. All operations are benign and standard for package integrity validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign internal version check without malicious intent or security risks. It does not access or transmit untrusted data or perform any suspicious actions.",
