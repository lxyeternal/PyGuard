  "purpose": "This code imports version information and AWSLogs class from local modules, serving as part of a package's initialization.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '_version' and 'core'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Static import statements with no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements from local modules, typical for package setup. There are no dynamic executions, network calls, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code is a standard pattern for exposing version info and core classes, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action needed.",
