  "purpose": "Importing version information and AWSLogs class from internal modules",
  "sources": "Internal module imports (_version and core modules)",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external data output",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for internal modules, one for version info and another for AWSLogs class. There are no user inputs, external data sources, or network connections involved. The imports are straightforward and standard practice for modular Python code. No obfuscated code, no suspicious variable names, no dynamic execution, or other anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks.",
