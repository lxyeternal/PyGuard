  "purpose": "Importing version information and core AWSLogs functionality from local modules.",
  "sources": "Reading from local modules: ._version and .core",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; only module imports",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; standard import statements, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements importing version info and core AWSLogs class from relative modules. There are no input reads from untrusted sources, no data leaks, and no suspicious code behavior. The imports are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import of version info and core functionality modules with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
