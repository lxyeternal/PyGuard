  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for AWS logs error handling with descriptive hints based on input arguments.",
  "sources": "self.args passed during exception instantiation",
  "sinks": "None; messages are formatted but not executed or transmitted",
  "flows": "Arguments in self.args used in hint() methods to generate messages",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard exception class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with methods that generate messages based on self.args. There are no external data reads, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. Use of self.args for message formatting is typical and safe. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present. The code is clean, simple, and serves its purpose without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for AWS logs errors. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
