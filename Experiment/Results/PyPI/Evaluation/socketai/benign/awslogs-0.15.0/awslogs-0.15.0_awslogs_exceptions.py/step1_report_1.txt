  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific AWS logs errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; exception arguments ('args') may be set during runtime.",
  "targets": "No direct data sinks or outputs; no data leak or security effect indicated.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation with arguments flows into the hint methods, which generate messages based on args.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward class definitions and method overrides.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception. Each class provides a custom 'hint' method that generates a message based on input arguments. There are no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, external data reads, or potential injection points. The use of 'self.args' is standard for exceptions; no malicious or unsafe behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions for error handling in AWS logs operations. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
