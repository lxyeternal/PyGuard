  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling AWS Logs errors with specific hints for troubleshooting.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code only defines classes and methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points; no untrusted data flows or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only provides exception class definitions with message formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; the code is straightforward class inheritance with string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base exception class and several specific exceptions related to AWS logs, each providing a hint method that returns a string message. The messages incorporate args for contextual information. No external data input, network communication, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code structure is standard, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns. There are no indications of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with descriptive hints. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.",
