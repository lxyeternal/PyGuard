{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for AWS logs handling, providing specific error messages and hints.",
  "sources": "None; the code defines classes and methods without external input reading.",
  "targets": "None; no data is sent or leaked to external systems.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks occurs in this code.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code appears straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes for AWS logs, each with a 'hint' method providing user guidance. The classes use class variables and methods to generate messages based on input arguments. There are no external data inputs, no network operations, no environment variable access, or other potentially risky behaviors. The structure is simple, clear, and typical for custom exception handling. No malicious or suspicious code elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes for AWS logs. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code's purpose is solely to improve error reporting and user guidance.",
