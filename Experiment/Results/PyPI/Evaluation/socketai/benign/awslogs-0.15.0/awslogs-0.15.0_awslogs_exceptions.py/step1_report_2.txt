  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for AWS logs handling with user-friendly hints.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions, __init__ method, self.args usage in hint methods.",
  "sinks": "self.args elements used in string formatting within hint methods.",
  "flows": "Input data passed to exceptions (args) flows into hint methods and is included in returned strings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; standard exception class definitions with dynamic messages.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exceptions inheriting from Exception, each with a code attribute and a method hint() that returns a descriptive string. These exceptions are designed to provide meaningful error messages related to AWS logs operations. The self.args elements are used to include user-supplied data in the messages. There is no dynamic execution, external data fetching, or insecure handling. The code appears straightforward and typical for custom exception definitions, with no signs of malicious intent or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for AWS logs error handling, with no malicious or security-risk elements detected.",
