  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for AWS Logs error handling with specific hints for each error type.",
  "sources": "Input data is from the self.args attribute of exception instances, which are set when exceptions are raised.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not output untrusted data directly, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised with specific arguments, which are then used in the hint methods to generate messages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No external network activity or data manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception, with class variables and methods returning string hints. The hint methods interpolate self.args elements into messages, which could potentially include untrusted input. However, there are no unsafe operations, external interactions, or malicious behaviors present. The classes appear straightforward and serve error messaging purposes. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in AWS logs context. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is benign and safe.",
