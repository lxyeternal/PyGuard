  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`, with no external data reading, no network activity, and no malicious behavior. The code is simple, using `self.args` to generate error messages, which is standard practice.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. They correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes with descriptive hints, and no suspicious patterns are present. No errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware` = 0\n   - `securityRisk` = 0\n   - `obfuscated` = 0  \n   These are consistent with the code's nature. Given the unanimous consensus, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since the code does not perform any dynamic code execution, data fetching, or any operation that could be malicious, raising the risk scores above 0.5 would be unjustified. The reports' assessments align with this.\n\n5. **Malware Score**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate. There is no indication of malicious behavior, code injection, or hidden payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign. Their analysis is cautious and accurate.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed reasoning provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and My Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 (very low, since it's just exception classes with no security implications)\n\n**Rationale**:  \nThe code is purely for error handling, with no malicious or security-sensitive behavior. It is standard, straightforward, and safe.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) as they accurately reflect the code's nature.",
