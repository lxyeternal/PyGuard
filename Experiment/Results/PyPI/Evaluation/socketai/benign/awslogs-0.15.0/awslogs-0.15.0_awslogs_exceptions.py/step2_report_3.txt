  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as straightforward custom exception classes inheriting from Exception.\n- The code uses class attributes and methods to generate error messages based on `self.args`.\n- No external data access, network activity, or dynamic code execution is evident.\n- The use of `self.args` for message formatting is standard and does not introduce security risks by itself.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code matches the description; no issues are found.\n   - The exception classes are well-structured and serve their purpose.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity.\n   - Security risk score of 0 is appropriate; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n   - Obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The confidence level of 1 is justified given the thorough and consistent analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Assumptions:**\n   - While `self.args` can contain untrusted input, the code only formats messages; no code injection or execution occurs.\n   - The reports correctly do not assume malicious intent where none exists.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes for AWS logs error handling.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are reasonable and justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (slightly above zero to account for potential misuse if args are untrusted, but overall negligible)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The code does not pose any security threat.\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n- The overall evaluation aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is safe, standard, and free of malware or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
