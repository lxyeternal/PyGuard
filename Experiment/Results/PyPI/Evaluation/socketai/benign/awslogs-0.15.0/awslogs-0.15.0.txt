The security risk is minimal, primarily related to handling user inputs and environment variables, which is standard. The masking of credentials during exceptions is a good security practice. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy."

      "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 1's suspicion score of 0.4 and risk score of 0.55 are justified given the described dynamic execution and network activity. Other reports are correctly scored as benign or inconclusive. Overall, the dependency does not exhibit confirmed malicious behavior but warrants cautious monitoring of Report 1. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and no further adjustments are necessary."
