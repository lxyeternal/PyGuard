{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to convert strings between various casing styles and formats.",
  "sources": "Input is taken from the function argument 'string' in each function.",
  "sinks": "The functions process the input string and return transformed strings; no external sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input string flows through various regex substitutions and string operations within each function, returning transformed strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. The code is straightforward string manipulation with no malicious intent. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string transformation functions using regex substitutions and string methods. There are no external network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The functions operate locally on input strings, converting their format. The only potential concern might be the regex replacements, but these are standard for such string operations and do not pose security risks. The code is well-structured and does not contain any anomalies or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of string format conversion functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility module intended for string formatting tasks.",
