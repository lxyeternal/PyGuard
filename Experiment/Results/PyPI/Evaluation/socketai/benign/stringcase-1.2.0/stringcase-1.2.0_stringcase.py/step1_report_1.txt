{
  "purpose": "The code provides multiple string transformation functions for formatting text into various cases (camel case, snake case, title case, etc.).",
  "sources": "The functions read input strings through their parameters, specifically the 'string' argument passed to each function.",
  "sinks": "The functions perform regex substitutions and string concatenations; no data is written to external systems, files, or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through regex substitutions and string manipulations, then returned. No external or untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks like network, file, or environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present. Functions rely solely on standard string processing and regex substitutions. No obfuscated or unusual code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple string conversion functions employing regex-based transformations. Each function takes an input string, performs transformations such as case conversion, punctuation replacement, or joining characters with specific delimiters, and returns the transformed string. There are no external data sources, no network calls, and no system modifications. The functions are standard string formatting utilities. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be purely for string manipulation purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for string case conversions, with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is benign and intended for string formatting. No malware or security vulnerabilities are identified.",
