{
  "purpose": "The code provides various string transformation functions such as case conversions and formatting utilities.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function arguments; no external data sources or untrusted inputs are explicitly processed.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that send data to external systems, network, or file I/O; functions return processed strings only.",
  "flows": "The functions process strings through regex substitutions and string manipulations; no dangerous data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code uses regex functions for string transformations, which are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple string conversion functions relying on regex for formatting purposes. There are no indications of external data inputs, network communication, or system modifications. All functions are pure and return processed strings without side effects. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are observed. The presence of a commented out regex in backslashcase is harmless and does not pose a risk. Overall, the code appears to be benign utility functions with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of string formatting functions with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and intended for string manipulation tasks.",
