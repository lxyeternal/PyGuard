{
  "purpose": "Provide various string case conversion functions for text formatting.",
  "sources": "Input strings to functions such as camelcase, capitalcase, constcase, etc.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly write to files, network, or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow through regex substitutions and string transformations within each function.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a commented-out regex in backslashcase function; no active malicious anomalies found.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs string transformations such as replacing, splitting, and changing case. All regex operations are straightforward string manipulations. There are no sources of untrusted input handling or sinks that could lead to data leaks or code injection. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code are present. The only notable point is the commented-out regex in backslashcase, which is harmless. The functions rely solely on regex and string methods, with no dynamic execution or external calls.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a collection of string formatting functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs safe string manipulations and does not include any suspicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
