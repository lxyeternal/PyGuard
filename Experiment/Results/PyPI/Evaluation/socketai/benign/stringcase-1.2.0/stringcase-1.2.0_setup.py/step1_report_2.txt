  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file and passing data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read './README.rst' without validation or exception handling; no suspicious code or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup from distutils.core and calls it with static package information. It reads the long_description from a file without sanitization or validation, which is typical for package setup scripts. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are involved. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are detected. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It solely defines package metadata and reads a README file for description.",
