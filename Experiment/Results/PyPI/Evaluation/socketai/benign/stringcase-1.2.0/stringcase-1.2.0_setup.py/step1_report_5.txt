{
  "purpose": "To set up and package the Python module 'stringcase' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long description; importing setup from distutils.core",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are present; no data leaks or external effects identified",
  "flows": "Input from the 'README.rst' file flows into the 'long_description' parameter during setup",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from 'distutils.core' and calls it with package metadata, including name, version, modules, URL, license, author info, and descriptions. The 'long_description' reads a local file './README.rst'. There are no dynamic code executions, no network calls, and no suspicious code patterns. All data used appears static and intended for package setup only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
