  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and reading README for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file, static package metadata definitions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; only local file read and static data passing",
  "flows": "File read operation for long_description, static data passed to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; use of distutils instead of setuptools is outdated but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation. It reads a local README file without validation, which is typical. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign a malware score of 0. The use of distutils is outdated but not malicious. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
