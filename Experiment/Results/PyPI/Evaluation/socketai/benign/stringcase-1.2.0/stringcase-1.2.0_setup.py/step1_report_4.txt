  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'stringcase' Python module for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads long_description content from './README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reads file content (long_description) during setup; no other data flows or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools', which is outdated but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration defining package metadata. It reads a README file for the long description, which is common practice. No dynamic code execution, no network calls, no data leaks, and no suspicious behavior identified. The code appears straightforward and intended solely for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for packaging a Python module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
