  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration for distribution using distutils.",
  "sources": "The script reads the README.rst file for the long_description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is from reading README.rst into long_description and package metadata into setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports distutils.core.setup, defines package metadata, and reads the README.rst file for long_description. No user input, environment variables, or network interactions are involved. The code performs standard setup configuration with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent. It simply prepares package information for distribution, which is typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
