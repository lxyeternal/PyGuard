{
  "purpose": "The code imports a mock behavior object from elasticmock and defines a function to disable server failure simulation, likely used in testing environments.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources; static import from elasticmock.behaviour.",
  "sinks": "Calling server_failure.disable() affects the mock behavior but does not impact system security or data flow.",
  "flows": "Function disable_all() calls server_failure.disable(), which disables mock server failures during tests.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward and minimal code with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility for controlling mock behavior in testing. It imports a specific object and calls its disable method. No untrusted data, no malicious code, and no security vulnerabilities are present. The purpose appears limited to testing, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing purposes, and does not contain malicious or security-compromising elements. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
