  "purpose": "The code imports a specific behavior from the elasticmock library and provides a function to disable that behavior.",

  "sinks": "The disable() method on server_failure object",
  "flows": "Calling disable_all() triggers server_failure.disable()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a mock behavior related to elasticmock and defining a function to disable that behavior. The elasticmock library is used for mocking Elasticsearch behavior in testing environments. The disable() method likely disables simulated failures for testing. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The code appears to be standard for testing purposes and contains no malicious or malicious-like behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility to disable failure simulations in elasticmock for testing. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
