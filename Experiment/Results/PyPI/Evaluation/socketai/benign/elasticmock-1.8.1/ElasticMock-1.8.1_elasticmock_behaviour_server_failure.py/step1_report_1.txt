{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator to simulate server failure responses based on a global enable/disable flag.",
  "sources": "The global variable __ENABLED, and the decorated function f which is wrapped to modify its output based on __ENABLED.",
  "sinks": "The response dictionary with status_code and error message, which could influence error handling or API responses.",
  "flows": "When __ENABLED is True, the decorated function returns a server error response; otherwise, it executes the original function.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not contain unusual or suspicious code patterns. The global control flag is simple but could be misused to disable or enable error responses.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a global flag __ENABLED that controls whether the wrapped function returns a simulated server failure response. The enable() and disable() functions toggle this flag. The server_failure decorator wraps any function to return a 500 error response if __ENABLED is True, otherwise it calls the original function. No user input, external data, or sensitive operations are involved. There are no hardcoded credentials or malicious activities. The structure and content suggest this is a testing or debugging utility, not malware or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility to simulate server failure responses conditionally. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose appears to be for testing server error handling. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
