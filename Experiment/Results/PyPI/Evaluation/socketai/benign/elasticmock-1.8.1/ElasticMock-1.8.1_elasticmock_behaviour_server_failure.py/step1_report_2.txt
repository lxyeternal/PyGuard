{
  "purpose": "This code provides a mechanism to toggle server failure responses, likely for testing or simulation purposes, by enabling or disabling a decorator that modifies function responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the global variable __ENABLED to determine if the server failure response should be triggered.",
  "sinks": "The decorator modifies the output of functions it wraps, potentially affecting how server responses are generated in an application.",
  "flows": "When __ENABLED is True, the decorated function returns a simulated 500 error response regardless of original function output; when False, it executes normally.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a global variable controlling behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code detected. The purpose appears to be testing simulation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines toggle functions enable() and disable() that set the global __ENABLED flag. The server_failure decorator wraps functions to return a 500 error if __ENABLED is True, otherwise it executes the original function. No external inputs, no suspicious data flow, or malicious code present. The pattern is straightforward and intended for testing or fault simulation. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended to simulate server failures for testing purposes. It uses standard Python features without malicious intent or security risks.",
