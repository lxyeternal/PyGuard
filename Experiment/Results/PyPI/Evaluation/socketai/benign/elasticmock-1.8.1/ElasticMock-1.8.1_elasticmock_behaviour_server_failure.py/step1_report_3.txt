  "purpose": "This code provides a simple mechanism to toggle server failure responses in a web application by wrapping functions with a decorator that can simulate internal server errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the global variable __ENABLED to determine whether to simulate a server failure.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a response dictionary with 'status_code' and 'error' keys when __ENABLED is True, which could affect how the server responds, but does not directly leak data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The decorator checks __ENABLED; if True, it returns a fixed error response, otherwise it calls the wrapped function, passing through arguments. No external input influences the decision directly, only the internal toggle.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded credentials are present. The toggle is a simple internal mechanism to simulate server errors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to enable or disable a global flag __ENABLED. The server_failure decorator modifies the behavior of wrapped functions based on this flag, returning a 500 error when enabled. The implementation is straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent or obfuscated logic. It appears to be a testing utility to simulate server failures for debugging or testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code. It functions as a toggle for simulating server errors, which can be useful in testing environments but poses no security threat itself.",
