{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators to enable or disable server failure responses, likely used for testing or simulating server errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only manipulates internal flags and functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send data externally or handle untrusted input; it only returns a static error response or the result of a function call.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows from external sources to sinks; the flow is limited to internal flag checks and function calls.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a global variable for controlling behavior is simple but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a flag '__ENABLED' to toggle server failure responses. The 'enable' and 'disable' functions modify this flag. The 'server_failure' decorator wraps functions to return a 500 error response if enabled. There are no external inputs, no suspicious code constructs, and no data leaks or malicious actions. The code appears to be intended for testing server error handling, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and designed for simulating server errors, possibly for testing purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
