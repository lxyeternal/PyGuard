  "purpose": "A utility to toggle server failure responses for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The global variable __ENABLED and the functions enable(), disable(), and the decorator server_failure.",
  "sinks": "The decorator server_failure controls the response returned, but does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "enable()/disable() modify __ENABLED; server_failure decorator checks __ENABLED to decide response.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple toggle for simulating server errors, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It uses a global flag controlled internally, with no external input affecting it. The decorator returns a fixed error response when enabled, otherwise calls the original function. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious activities are present. The code is clear, with no obfuscation, and intended for testing. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing utility for simulating server failures, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify its purpose and assign appropriate scores. No improvements are necessary.",
