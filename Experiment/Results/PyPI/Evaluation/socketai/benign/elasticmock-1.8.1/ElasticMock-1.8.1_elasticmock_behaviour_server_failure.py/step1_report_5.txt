{
  "purpose": "This code defines utility functions and a decorator to toggle server failure responses for testing or simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the function arguments (*args, **kwargs) within the decorator.",
  "sinks": "The decorator constructs a response dictionary with a fixed error message when enabled.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are passed to the decorated function; if __ENABLED is True, the response is replaced with an error dictionary, otherwise the original function response is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a global toggle (__ENABLED) that controls error response behavior; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides enable() and disable() functions to toggle a global variable __ENABLED. The server_failure decorator wraps a function, returning a simulated server failure response if __ENABLED is True, otherwise executing the original function. The code is straightforward and intended for testing purposes. No malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are evident. The logic is simple and safe, designed to simulate server errors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a testing utility for simulating server failures. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. The structure is clear and safe, with no security risks or malicious intent detected.",
