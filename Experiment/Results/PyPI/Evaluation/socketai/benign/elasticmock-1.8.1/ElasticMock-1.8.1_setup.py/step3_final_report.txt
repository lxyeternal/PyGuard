  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python project 'ElasticMock', defining metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; static package metadata and dependencies defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or user input processed.",
  "flows": "Reads local file 'README.md' -> passes static data to setuptools.setup() -> completes package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Minor issue: in 'find_packages', 'exclude' parameter is set as exclude=('tests'), which is a string, not a tuple/list; should be exclude=('tests',) or exclude=['tests'].",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static setup script with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. It reads a local README file and configures package metadata and dependencies. The only notable anomaly is the 'exclude' parameter in 'find_packages', which is a minor bug but does not impact security. All other signals indicate benign, well-structured code with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration with a minor bug in package discovery parameters. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static and straightforward nature.",
