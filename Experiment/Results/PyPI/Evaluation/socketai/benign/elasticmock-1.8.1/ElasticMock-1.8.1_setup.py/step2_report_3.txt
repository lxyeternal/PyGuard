  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for a Python package.\n- They confirm that no untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code reads a local README.md file and calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata and dependencies.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's static, benign nature.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly reflecting the absence of obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are 0, aligning with the lack of vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The code is a typical, well-structured setup script with no anomalies.\n- No external inputs, no code execution beyond static file reading, and no suspicious operations.\n- The package dependencies are standard and related to the package's purpose.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The reports assume the README.md file exists and is safe to read; if missing, this could cause an error, but it doesn't imply malicious intent.\n- No dynamic or runtime code execution, so no attack vectors are present.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The overall security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The scores given are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- Risk: 0 (no security vulnerabilities or risks)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The provided reports are accurate and appropriately scored.",
