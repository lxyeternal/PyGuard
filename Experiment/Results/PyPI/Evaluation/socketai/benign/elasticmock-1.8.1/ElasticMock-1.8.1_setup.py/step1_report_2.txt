  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the ElasticMock Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setuptools, and defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input, no sinks that handle external or untrusted data that could lead to data leaks or malicious execution.",
  "flows": "Read README.md -> Set package info and dependencies -> Call setuptools.setup() with provided metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks for a Python package: reading a local README file, defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All code uses standard modules and practices for package configuration. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. No external data sources or sinks are involved beyond normal package setup operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and intended solely for package configuration.",
