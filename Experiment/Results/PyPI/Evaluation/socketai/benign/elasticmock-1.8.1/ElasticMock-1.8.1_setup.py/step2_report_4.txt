  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for a Python package.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external untrusted data sources are involved.\n- The code reads a local README.md file, which is a common practice, and then proceeds with package configuration.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which seems appropriate given the static and benign nature of the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any obfuscated segments; all code is straightforward.\n- The dependency list is standard for such a package.\n- The process flow is typical: read README, define metadata, call setup().\n\n**Score assessments:**\n- The reports' scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's analysis.\n- Since there's no evidence of malicious intent, the risk scores should remain low.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only minor point is the use of `setuptools.find_packages(exclude=('tests'))`. The `exclude` parameter should be a list or tuple; in the code, it's a tuple with a single string, which is correct. No problem here.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- No external data or network activity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious or security issues.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- I agree with the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and standard for its purpose.",
