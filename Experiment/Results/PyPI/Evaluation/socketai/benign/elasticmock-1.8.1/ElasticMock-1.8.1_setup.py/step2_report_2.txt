  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for a Python package.\n- No untrusted data, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external inputs beyond reading a local README.md are involved.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.\n- The scores assigned are all zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code only reads a local file and calls setuptools.setup() with static data.\n- No external data sources, no code obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no network activity.\n- The package's purpose is benign: mocking Elasticsearch for testing.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0, justified.\n- Obfuscated score: consistently 0, justified.\n- Risk score: consistently 0, justified.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly identify that there's no malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- No reason to adjust scores; they are appropriate given the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical, safe setup script with no security concerns.\n- The scores are accurate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Final note:**\nAll reports are accurate and comprehensive. No further action needed.",
