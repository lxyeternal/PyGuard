{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'ElasticMock', used to facilitate packaging and distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; no other input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Uses setuptools.setup() to define package metadata and dependencies; no sink involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md as a source; passes static metadata and dependencies into setup function; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The code is standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and reads a local README.md file for description content. It defines package metadata including name, version, author details, description, URL, and dependencies. The setup function is called with these static values. There are no inputs from external sources at runtime, no untrusted data handling, nor any code that could be malicious. The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not handle untrusted data or perform any unsafe operations. Overall security risk is minimal.",
