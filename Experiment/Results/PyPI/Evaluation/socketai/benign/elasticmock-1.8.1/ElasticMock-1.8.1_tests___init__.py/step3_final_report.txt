  "purpose": "Unit testing setup for Elasticsearch using elasticmock to mock responses.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, defines constants, and creates a test class with a setup method; uses datetime.now() for timestamp.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows, external inputs, or data leaks; no network transmission or external data processing.",
  "flows": "No external data flows; test data is static or runtime-generated within the test environment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of datetime.now() is standard for test timestamps; no suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test setup for Elasticsearch with elasticmock, importing standard libraries, defining constants, and configuring a test class. It connects to localhost, uses runtime-generated timestamp, and does not process untrusted data or perform network operations. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present. All signals indicate a benign testing environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard testing setup with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
