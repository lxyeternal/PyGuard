  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe testing utility for mocking Elasticsearch clients. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is negligible. The existing high risk scores are overstated; they should be adjusted to reflect the benign nature of the code, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0."
