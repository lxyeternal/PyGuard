It operates entirely within in-memory data structures, with no external interactions or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting its purpose as a testing utility."

The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with its purpose. The main risk is misuse outside controlled testing environments, but this does not constitute a security issue in the code itself."

The scores are appropriate; the only minor note is the non-cryptographic randomness, which does not constitute a security threat in this context."

The only minor security consideration is that externally supplied decorators could be malicious, but the code itself is safe. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a very low security risk score (0.1) is appropriate to reflect external decorator safety considerations."
