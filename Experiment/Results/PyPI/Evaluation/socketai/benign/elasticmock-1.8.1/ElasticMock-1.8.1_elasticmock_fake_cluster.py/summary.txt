  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, testing-oriented mock class that returns static cluster health data. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with its purpose. The main risk is misuse outside controlled testing environments, but this does not constitute a security issue in the code itself."
