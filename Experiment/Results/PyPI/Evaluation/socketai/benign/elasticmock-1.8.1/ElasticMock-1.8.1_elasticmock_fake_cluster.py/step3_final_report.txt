{
  "purpose": "Mock implementation of Elasticsearch cluster health for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The 'health' method returns static, hardcoded cluster status data; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The method directly returns static data without external input, so no source-to-sink data flows exist.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The class 'FakeClusterClient' inherits from 'ClusterClient' and overrides the 'health()' method to return fixed cluster status data. The method is decorated with '@query_params', but parameters are unused. No external input, network activity, or data leaks are involved. The code appears intended solely for testing or mocking, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the benign nature and potential misuse outside testing environments. The static data could be misused if used improperly, but this is a usage concern, not a security flaw.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, testing-oriented mock class that returns static cluster health data. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with its purpose. The main risk is misuse outside controlled testing environments, but this does not constitute a security issue in the code itself.",
