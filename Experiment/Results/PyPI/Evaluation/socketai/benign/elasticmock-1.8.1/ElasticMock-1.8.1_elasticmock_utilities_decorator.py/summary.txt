  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for applying multiple decorators to class methods. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor security consideration is that externally supplied decorators could be malicious, but the code itself is safe. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a very low security risk score (0.1) is appropriate to reflect external decorator safety considerations."
