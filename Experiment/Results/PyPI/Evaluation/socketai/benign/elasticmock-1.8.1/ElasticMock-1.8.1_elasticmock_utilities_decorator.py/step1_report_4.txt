{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator factory function that applies a list of decorators to all methods of a class, optionally only to public methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads the class's __dict__ attribute to iterate over class attributes and uses getattr to access each attribute.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks related to untrusted input or data leaks; the code only modifies class methods.",
  "flows": "The code flows from class attribute iteration to applying decorators on callable attributes, modifying class methods in-place.",
  "anomalies": "The code applies multiple decorators to class methods but does not validate the decorators or check their safety. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present. The code is straightforward and standard for decorator application.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a higher-order function 'for_all_methods' which returns a decorator 'decorate'. This decorator applies a list of decorators to each method of a class, optionally only to public methods. It uses class __dict__ to iterate over attributes, checks if attributes are callable, and applies decorators accordingly. No external inputs, no data leaks, no suspicious operations, or obfuscated code are present. The implementation appears standard and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a class decorator to apply multiple decorators to class methods. There are no malicious behaviors, no suspicious code, and no security concerns based on the provided snippet.",
