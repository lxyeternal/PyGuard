{
  "purpose": "Define a class decorator that applies a list of decorators to all methods of a class, optionally only to public methods.",
  "sources": "The function parameters 'decorators' and 'apply_on_public_only'; class attribute '__dict__'; 'getattr' calls to access class methods.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves class attributes, filters for callables, and applies decorators directly to methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code. The code performs straightforward decoration logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a higher-order decorator function that, when applied to a class, iterates over its attributes. It filters out private attributes if 'apply_on_public_only' is True, then applies each decorator in the 'decorators' list to all callable attributes (methods). The implementation uses 'getattr' to retrieve methods and 'setattr' to replace them with decorated versions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious external activity. The code appears standard for dynamic method decoration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for applying multiple decorators to class methods, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
