{
  "purpose": "A decorator factory that applies a list of decorators to all methods of a class, optionally only public methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes and methods during class decoration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code manipulates class attributes and methods in a controlled manner.",
  "flows": "Decorator functions are retrieved and applied to class methods during class decoration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic detected. The code dynamically applies decorators which is standard practice but can be misused if decorators are malicious. No external input or data sources are used here.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that returns a class decorator. Inside, it iterates over class attributes, skipping private ones if specified, and applies provided decorators to callable attributes (methods). This pattern is common for method modification or instrumentation. No external data inputs, network calls, or sensitive operations are present. The dynamic application of decorators is normal, but if the decorators themselves are malicious, they could modify behavior unexpectedly. Overall, the code itself is benign and appears to be a standard class decorator utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for applying decorators to class methods, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It could be misused if malicious decorators are supplied, but the code as written is benign.",
