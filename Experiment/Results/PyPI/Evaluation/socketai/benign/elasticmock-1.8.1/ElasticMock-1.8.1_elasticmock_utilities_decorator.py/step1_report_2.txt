{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator factory to apply a list of decorators to all methods of a class, optionally only to public methods.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, input, or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or vulnerable operations; no data leaks, network connections, or sensitive actions are evident.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. The code structure is straightforward and common for decorator application.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a class decorator 'for_all_methods' that applies a list of decorators to each method of the class. It iterates over class attributes, skips private attributes if specified, and applies each decorator to callable attributes. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The logic is typical for enhancing class methods, with no signs of obfuscation or malware patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a class decorator factory with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or compromise system security.",
