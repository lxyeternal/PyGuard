  "purpose": "A class decorator factory that applies a list of decorators to all or only public methods of a class during class decoration.",
  "sources": "Class attribute dictionary (__dict__), getattr calls to retrieve methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Class attributes -> callable attributes -> decorators applied via setattr.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that returns a class decorator. When applied, it iterates over class attributes, skips private ones if specified, checks if attributes are callable, and applies each decorator in the list to these methods. It uses standard Python features without external inputs or network activity. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The only potential concern is that supplied decorators could be malicious, but this is external to the code itself. The implementation is correct, clear, and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for applying multiple decorators to class methods. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor security consideration is that externally supplied decorators could be malicious, but the code itself is safe. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a very low security risk score (0.1) is appropriate to reflect external decorator safety considerations.",
