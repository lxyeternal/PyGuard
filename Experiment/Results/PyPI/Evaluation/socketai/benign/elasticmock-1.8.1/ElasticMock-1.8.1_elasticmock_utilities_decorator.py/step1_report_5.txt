{
  "purpose": "A decorator factory that applies a list of decorators to all methods of a class, optionally only to public methods.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'decorators' and class attributes (__dict__).",
  "sinks": "Application of decorators to class methods; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Decorators provided as input are applied directly to class methods; no external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution. No hidden or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'for_all_methods' which creates a class decorator. This class decorator iterates over class attributes, skips private attributes if specified, and applies each decorator in the 'decorators' list to callable attributes (methods). The implementation appears standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code relies on standard Python features and does not perform any network, file, or sensitive data operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a class decorator applying other decorators to class methods. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a benign utility function.",
