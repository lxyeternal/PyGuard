  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports systematically.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code appears to be a standard `setup.py` script for a Python package.\n   - It reads `README.rst` and `HISTORY.rst` for the long description.\n   - It uses `find_packages()` to include all packages.\n   - The classifiers specify support for Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.2.\n   - The package is versioned as 1.0.0 and licensed under MIT.\n\n   **Conclusion:** There are no obvious security issues, malicious code, or vulnerabilities present in this code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports contain only \"Empty response\" errors with no details.\n   - No specific issues or vulnerabilities are identified.\n   - Without additional context, no assumptions about malicious activity or vulnerabilities can be made.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Since no issues are reported, the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all be **0**.\n   - Any higher scores would be unjustified given the lack of evidence.\n\n4. **Potential Malicious Behavior or Vulnerabilities:**\n   - The code is a typical setup script; no code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident.\n   - The package URL points to a GitHub repository, which should be checked for legitimacy, but based solely on this code, there's no indication of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not provide any claims or evidence, so there's nothing to challenge or verify.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - Given the absence of any issues, scores should be at the lowest level.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the provided code and the empty reports, there is no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. All scores should be zero, reflecting no known issues.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Continue monitoring for any future reports or code changes.\n- Verify the legitimacy of the package source if deploying in sensitive environments.",
