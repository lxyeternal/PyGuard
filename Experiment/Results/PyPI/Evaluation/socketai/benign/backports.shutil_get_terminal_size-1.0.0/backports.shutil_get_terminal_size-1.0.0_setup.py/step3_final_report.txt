  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, providing package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files for long description; using find_packages() to discover packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code execution or data leakage points present.",
  "flows": "File reads for description -> setup() call with metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious elements. It reads documentation files and configures package metadata. No external dependencies or dynamic code execution are present. The provided reports are empty, indicating no identified issues. Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features, the likelihood of malicious intent or vulnerabilities is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The supply chain risk is minimal, and the malware score should be 0. The code is clear, straightforward, and aligns with standard practices.",
