  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports systematically.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if reported issues are present in the code**\n\n- The reports are all empty responses, so no specific issues or vulnerabilities are directly highlighted.\n- The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package, with no obvious malicious or suspicious code snippets.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning**\n\n- Since the reports are empty, there's no reasoning or claims to evaluate.\n- No evidence of malicious code, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation is provided.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- No scores are provided in the reports, so no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Without any specific issues or claims, assigning a high risk score isn't justified.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward setup script, typical for open-source packages.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate malware score**\n\n- No malicious activity is evident in the code.\n- The package name and description suggest it's a simple backport utility, not malware.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- Since no vulnerabilities are claimed or demonstrated, there's no basis for assuming potential issues.\n\n**Step 7: Check consistency of scores with the report**\n\n- No scores or claims are present, so consistency isn't an issue here.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — no indication of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.0** — no apparent vulnerabilities or issues.\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The code is a standard setup script with no suspicious or malicious elements.\n- The empty reports suggest either a lack of analysis or incomplete reporting.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the provided code and the empty reports, I recommend a **malware score of 0.0**, an **obfuscated score of 0.0**, and a **risk score of 0.0**. There are no signs of security issues or malicious intent in this package.",
