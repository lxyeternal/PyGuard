  "purpose": "Unit tests for get_terminal_size() function, verifying behavior with environment variables and system calls.",
  "sources": "Environment variables COLUMNS and LINES, subprocess call to 'stty size', sys.__stdout__.fileno()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; subprocess output is read but not used maliciously",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence get_terminal_size(), subprocess output is parsed to verify terminal size, no malicious flow",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward testing logic, no suspicious patterns or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard terminal size detection tests, manipulating environment variables and calling 'stty size'. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess call is a common method for terminal size detection. No data leaks, network activity, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard testing code for terminal size detection, with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
