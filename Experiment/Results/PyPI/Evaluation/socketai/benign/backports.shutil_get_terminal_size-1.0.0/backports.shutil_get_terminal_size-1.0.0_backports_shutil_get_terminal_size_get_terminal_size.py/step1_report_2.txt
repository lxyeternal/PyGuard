{
  "purpose": "Provide a Python function to retrieve terminal size, with fallback options and environment variable checks.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.environ['COLUMNS'], os.environ['LINES']), file descriptor from sys.__stdout__.fileno(), and system calls via ctypes or fcntl/ioctl.",
  "sinks": "Uses system calls and environment variables to determine terminal dimensions; no data exfiltration or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → system calls to retrieve terminal size → return terminal_size object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code; uses standard modules and approaches for terminal size detection. The code appears to be a backport implementation, not obfuscated or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports system modules based on OS, uses standard practices for terminal size detection, and employs exception handling to fall back to default values. It reads environment variables and calls system-specific functions, but all operations are standard for terminal size querying. No indications of data leaks, network activity, or malicious behavior are present. The overall design is a straightforward utility function with proper fallback mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation for obtaining terminal size, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It employs common patterns for system interaction and environment variable reading, without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
