  "purpose": "Retrieve the terminal window size in a cross-platform manner, using environment variables and system APIs, with fallbacks to default sizes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables COLUMNS and LINES; system calls via ctypes on Windows and fcntl/ioctl on Unix; sys.__stdout__.fileno() for terminal querying.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; primarily reads environment variables and system APIs.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables -> checks if valid -> if not, queries system APIs -> returns terminal_size object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; exception handling is broad but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, cross-platform implementation for obtaining terminal size, employing environment variables and system calls. It includes exception handling for robustness and defaults to standard sizes if querying fails. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected, and the code uses well-known APIs and practices. The environment variables can be manipulated but are expected in such utilities. Overall, the code is benign, clear, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for terminal size detection with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
