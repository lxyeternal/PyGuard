  "purpose": "A minimal module providing metadata and importing a get_terminal_size function from a local module, serving as a backport for compatibility.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .get_terminal_size import get_terminal_size",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network, file, or user input handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code does not process data flows; it only imports a function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard metadata variables and a simple import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package module defining metadata and importing a function from a local module. It contains no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The import source is internal, indicating a compatibility shim. No external data handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The uniform scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concerns. All evidence supports a safe, straightforward compatibility module.",
