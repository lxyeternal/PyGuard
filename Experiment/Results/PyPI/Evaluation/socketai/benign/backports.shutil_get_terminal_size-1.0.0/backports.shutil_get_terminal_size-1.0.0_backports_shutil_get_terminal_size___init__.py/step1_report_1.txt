  "purpose": "Provides a backport of the get_terminal_size function from Python 3.3's shutil module to older Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .get_terminal_size import get_terminal_size",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling, external network calls, or sensitive operations present.",
  "flows": "N/A - straightforward import without data flow concerns.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a typical module metadata and import statement with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code contains module metadata (title, version, author, license) and an import statement for a local module get_terminal_size. It appears to be a simple package component designed for compatibility. No data input, output, network, or security-sensitive operations are present. The import is from a relative module, suggesting local packaging. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module that serves as a compatibility shim for get_terminal_size. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
