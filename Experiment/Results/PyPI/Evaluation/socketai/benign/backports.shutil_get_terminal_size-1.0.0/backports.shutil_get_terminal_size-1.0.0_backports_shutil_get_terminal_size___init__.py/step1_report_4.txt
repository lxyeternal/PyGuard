  "purpose": "To provide a backport of the get_terminal_size function from Python 3.3's shutil module.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .get_terminal_size import get_terminal_size",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or external data leaks",
  "flows": "Importing get_terminal_size from a local module, used internally; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, mainly metadata and an import statement",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata and imports a function from a relative module. There are no user inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The import is from a local file named get_terminal_size, which appears to be a standard backport implementation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module descriptor and import statement for a backported function. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and purpose-specific.",
