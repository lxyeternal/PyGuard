  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the provided assessments.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward package module that provides a backport of `get_terminal_size`.\n- The code consists solely of module metadata and an import statement from a local module.\n- No external network activity, data handling, or user input is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The import source is a local module, suggesting this is part of a package designed for compatibility.\n\n**Code Verification:**\n- The code snippet matches the description: it contains package metadata variables and a single import statement:\n  ```python\n  from .get_terminal_size import get_terminal_size\n  ```\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n- The purpose is explicitly to provide a backport, which aligns with the benign analysis.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n1. **Malware Score: 0**\n   - The code is purely for compatibility; no malicious logic is present.\n   - All reports agree on this point.\n   - **Conclusion:** The malware score is correctly set to 0.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Score: 0**\n   - The code is clear, with no obfuscation or code hiding techniques.\n   - No suspicious patterns are observed.\n   - **Conclusion:** The obfuscated score is correctly set to 0.\n\n3. **Security Risk Score: 0**\n   - No vulnerabilities, insecure data handling, or risky behaviors are evident.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security issues.\n   - **Conclusion:** The security risk score is correctly set to 0.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n- The reports are consistent in their assessments.\n- The purpose of the code is explicitly stated and aligns with the implementation.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are warranted based on this snippet.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, straightforward module intended for compatibility purposes. All evidence supports a zero risk, zero malware, and zero obfuscation assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the context of the entire package; however, based solely on this snippet and the reports, the assessments are accurate.",
