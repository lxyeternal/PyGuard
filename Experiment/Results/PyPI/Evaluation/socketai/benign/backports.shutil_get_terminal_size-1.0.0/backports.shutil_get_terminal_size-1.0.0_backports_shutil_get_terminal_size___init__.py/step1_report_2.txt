{
  "purpose": "Provide a backport of the get_terminal_size function from Python 3.3's shutil module to ensure compatibility on older Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing get_terminal_size from a local module (.get_terminal_size). Metadata variables (__title__, __version__, etc.) are assigned static strings.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; the code only performs import and variable assignments. No untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply defines metadata and imports a function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected. The code uses standard practices for package initialization and metadata assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata variables and imports a function from a relative module, likely part of the same package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The import source appears to be a local module, not an external or suspicious source. Overall, this appears to be a straightforward, benign package module with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a compatibility shim with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs standard package setup tasks with no suspicious behavior.",
