  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code snippet.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code snippet is a minimal module that provides metadata and imports a function `get_terminal_size` from a local module `.get_terminal_size`.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and purpose-specific.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is straightforward: module metadata + import statement.\n   - No errors, flaws, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n   - The import is from a relative module, which is typical for package internal code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as a benign package component.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are present.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign such scores; all are 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, data handling, or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not contain any malicious logic.\n   - The import is from a local module, likely part of the same package.\n   - No malware indicators are present.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid speculative claims; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The uniform scores align with the code's content.\n   - No inconsistencies are observed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a benign, straightforward package component with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                      |\n| Security Risk  | 0                      |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk indicators.",
