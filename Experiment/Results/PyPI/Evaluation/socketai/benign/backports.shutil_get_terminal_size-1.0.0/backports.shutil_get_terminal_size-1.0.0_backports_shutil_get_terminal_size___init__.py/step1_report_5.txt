{
  "purpose": "This module provides a backported implementation of the get_terminal_size function from Python 3.3's shutil module, enabling compatibility on earlier Python versions.",
  "sources": "The code imports get_terminal_size from a local module .get_terminal_size.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external data handling, or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "The imported function is re-exported, with no data flow or processing occurring in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard module metadata and import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of module metadata, comments, and a single import statement. It does not include any user input handling, data processing, or network operations. The import points to a local module, which could contain additional code, but based on this fragment, there is no malicious behavior. The purpose is to backport functionality for compatibility, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility shim with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, with no anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected in this fragment.",
