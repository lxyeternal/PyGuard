{
  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package namespace sharing",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable, which is used internally by Python to determine the module's search path",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or used in a way that leads to data leaks or effects",
  "flows": "The code modifies the __path__ variable to extend the module search path; no data flow to external sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of extend_path is a standard namespace package pattern; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil and uses it to extend __path__ with itself, a typical pattern for namespace packages. No input handling, no untrusted data sources, and no sensitive operations are involved. This pattern is standard in Python for namespace package support, and does not indicate malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for namespace package extension, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
