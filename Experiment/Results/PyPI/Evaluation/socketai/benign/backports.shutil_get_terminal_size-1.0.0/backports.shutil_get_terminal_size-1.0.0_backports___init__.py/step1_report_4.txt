{
  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package resources using pkgutil's extend_path.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and the __name__ variable, which are standard for package modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data influences system behavior are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the existing __path__ variable through extend_path to modify __path__ for resource loading.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace packages; no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil to extend the module's search path for resources, which is typical in namespace packages. It uses __path__ and __name__, both standard variables, with no manipulation or data leakage. No input/output, network operations, or data transformations are present that could indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign pattern for namespace packages, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
