  "purpose": "Support for namespace packages in Python by extending __path__ using pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "Import of extend_path from pkgutil, application to __path__ and __name__.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Import of extend_path -> application to __path__ with __name__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard pattern for namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil and applies it to __path__, a common pattern for supporting namespace packages. It involves no untrusted input, network activity, or malicious behavior. The code is minimal, standard, and safe. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. All reports correctly interpret this as a standard, safe pattern with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. It poses no security risk or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
