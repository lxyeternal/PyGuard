{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and exception handling for validation error reporting.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; internal class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Error data created and formatted into JSON strings within exception class.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a namedtuple subclass with a custom __str__ method for detailed error messages, and an exception class that serializes multiple errors into JSON. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. Use of json.dumps is standard; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The logic is correct, and the code serves purely for internal validation error reporting. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions as a simple validation error reporting utility. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
