{
  "purpose": "Define custom data structure and exception for validation error reporting",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; the code defines classes and imports modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output paths that process untrusted data outside the class initializations and string representations",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted input to untrusted output; class methods mainly handle internal data and formatting",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code; standard class and exception definitions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a namedtuple subclass 'ValidationErrorData' with a custom __str__ method for descriptive error messages. It also defines a 'ValidationError' class that serializes multiple error messages into a JSON string during initialization. There are no external inputs, no network or file operations, and no dynamic code execution. The code appears to be straightforward data structure and exception handling logic, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for validation error reporting, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a simple data container and exception class, with no evidence of malicious or supply chain threats.",
