{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and exceptions for validation error reporting, including detailed error messages.",
  "sources": "Imports from collections and json modules; usage of class attributes and methods.",
  "sinks": "Serializes errors into JSON format; no data sinks appear to handle untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Error data is created, converted to string, and serialized into JSON, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. Usage of namedtuple and exception handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a namedtuple subclass for validation error data and an exception class that serializes multiple errors into a JSON string. The structure is typical for validation frameworks. No input/output functions, network calls, or code injections are present. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are detected. The code appears purely for validation error reporting, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and benign, serving as a utility for validation error handling. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
