  "purpose": "Define custom validation error data structures for schema validation and serialize validation errors to JSON format.",
  "sources": "None; no external input sources or data reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data outputs or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code defines data structures and error handling without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated logic, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a named tuple for validation error data, providing a custom string representation for error details. It also defines a custom exception class that serializes errors to JSON. There are no input/output operations, network calls, or data manipulation that could be exploited. The code appears straightforward and standard for validation error handling. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation for validation error reporting and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely for error data representation and serialization.",
