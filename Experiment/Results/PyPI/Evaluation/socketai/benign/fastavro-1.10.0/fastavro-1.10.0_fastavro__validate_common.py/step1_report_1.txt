  "purpose": "Define custom data structure and exception classes for validation error handling and representation.",
  "sources": "Importing 'namedtuple' from 'collections' and 'json' module; class constructors and methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or external outputs other than exception message formatting.",
  "flows": "Error data is formatted into JSON string in ValidationError, but no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of json.dumps in exception message; no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a namedtuple subclass for validation error data and an Exception subclass for handling multiple errors. It formats error messages as JSON strings, which could be useful for structured error reporting. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The code appears straightforward and intended for validation error management.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a validation error data structure and custom exception with JSON formatting. It contains no malicious or suspicious features. No security risks are evident.",
