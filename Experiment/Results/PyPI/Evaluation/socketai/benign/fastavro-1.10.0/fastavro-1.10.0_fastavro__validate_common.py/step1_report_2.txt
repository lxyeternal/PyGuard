  "purpose": "Define data structures and custom exception for validation errors with detailed error messages.",
  "sources": "None; the code only creates classes and imports modules.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data flows from untrusted sources or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no source-to-sink data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of namedtuple inheritance and custom __str__ method; no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a namedtuple subclass 'ValidationErrorData' with a custom string representation for detailed validation error reporting. It also defines a 'ValidationError' exception that serializes multiple errors into JSON format. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. The structure and imports are standard, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of data validation error handling without malicious intent or security risks.",
