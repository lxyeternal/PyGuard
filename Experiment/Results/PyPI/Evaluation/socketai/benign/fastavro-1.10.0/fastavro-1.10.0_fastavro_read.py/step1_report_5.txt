{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up and export various functions and constants related to reading and processing Avro and JSON data, likely as part of a larger data processing library.",
  "sources": "Code reads from local modules: ._read, .json_read, .logical_readers, and ._read_common.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks for untrusted data or actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions or outputs. The module mainly imports and exposes functions and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation are present. The import fallback for _read_py is standard practice for compatibility, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports internal modules and re-exports specific functions and constants. It performs a typical setup for a Python package's __init__.py or module file, with conditional import logic for compatibility. No code injections, network connections, or suspicious operations are evident. The use of __all__ clarifies the public API. Overall, it appears benign and straightforward, focused on data reading functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply re-exports functions and constants from internal modules, with no external data or network activity. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
