{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up imports and exposing a public API for a module related to reading and processing data, likely in formats such as Avro and JSON.",
  "sources": "The code reads from local modules (_read, json_read, logical_readers, _read_common) and conditionally imports _read_py as _read if _read is not available.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform critical operations such as network access, system modifications, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The code flows from import statements to assigning imported functions and constants to module-level variables and exporting them via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The code only performs straightforward import and assignment operations.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import internal modules, handling ImportError by importing an alternative module. It then exposes several functions and constants related to data reading operations. All operations are standard and involve no untrusted data processing or malicious logic. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The structure and content suggest this is a typical data processing module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module initialization script for a data reading library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
