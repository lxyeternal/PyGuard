  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup module for a data reading library, with no malicious intent or security risks evident. The fallback import pattern is common and not suspicious in this context. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior."
