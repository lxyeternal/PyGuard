  "purpose": "Utility functions for reading various logical data types from serialized data streams, such as timestamps, dates, UUIDs, decimals, and times.",
  "sources": "Data input is primarily read from the 'data' parameter passed to each function, which may originate from external data sources or serialized streams.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects. No system commands, network operations, or file writes are executed.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data flows from input parameters into functions that convert raw bytes or integers into Python data types, but there are no dangerous flows such as command execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The code consistently avoids using potentially unsafe functions like 'datetime.fromtimestamp', referencing a known Python bug. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of data deserialization functions focusing on converting raw data (integers, bytes) into Python datetime, uuid, decimal, and time objects. It uses safe conversion methods and does not perform any system modifications, network communication, or file operations. The presence of 'LOGICAL_READERS' mapping logical types to functions supports a structured deserialization framework. No anomalies, malicious code, or security risks are evident in the implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured data deserialization logic with no malicious intent or security issues. It solely converts data formats and relies on provided schemas without unsafe operations.",
