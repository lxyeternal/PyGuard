  "purpose": "Utility functions for decoding various timestamp, date, UUID, and decimal data types from serialized formats, used in data processing or deserialization.",
  "sources": "Input data parameters in functions such as data (integers, bytes, etc.) passed to reading functions like read_timestamp_millis, read_uuid, read_decimal, etc.",
  "sinks": "Return statements converting data into Python datetime, date, uuid.UUID, decimal.Decimal, and time objects; no external output or network connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into processing logic (e.g., conversions, byte-to-int), then outputs as Python objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. Use of well-known libraries (uuid, datetime, decimal). No obfuscated or dynamic code. The comment about datetime.fromtimestamp suggests avoiding certain system calls, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to convert serialized timestamp, date, UUID, and decimal data into Python native objects. Each function performs straightforward data transformations, including byte-to-integer conversions, datetime calculations, and UUID parsing. The use of constants for time calculations is standard. The presence of a schema parameter is consistent with schema-aware deserialization but does not introduce malicious behavior. The overall structure is clear, and no code appears to perform any harmful actions. No external network, file I/O, or environment variable access is present. The code’s purpose aligns with data decoding, with no suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard set of data deserialization functions for a schema-based data processing system. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The code is straightforward and safe, primarily handling data conversions without side effects.",
