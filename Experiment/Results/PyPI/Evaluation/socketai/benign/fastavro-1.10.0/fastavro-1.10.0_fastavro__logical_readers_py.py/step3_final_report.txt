  "purpose": "Functions for deserializing timestamps, dates, UUIDs, decimals, and times from serialized data formats into Python objects.",
  "sources": "Input data such as integers, byte arrays, or serialized representations passed to each function.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is converted internally without side effects or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through conversion logic into Python data types like datetime, date, uuid.UUID, decimal.Decimal, and time.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Comments reference known Python bugs, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward deserialization functions utilizing standard libraries. No network, file, or environment variable access is present. The functions are schema-aware and perform simple arithmetic conversions. The comments about avoiding 'datetime.fromtimestamp' are about known bugs, not malicious behavior. The overall structure is typical for schema-driven data decoding. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified. The code's purpose is benign, and the implementation is clean and clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, standard data deserialization utilities with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware score (0) and minimal security risk (around 0.1-0.2) are justified. The assessments in the original reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
