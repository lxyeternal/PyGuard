  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, standard data deserialization utilities with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware score (0) and minimal security risk (around 0.1-0.2) are justified. The assessments in the original reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature."
