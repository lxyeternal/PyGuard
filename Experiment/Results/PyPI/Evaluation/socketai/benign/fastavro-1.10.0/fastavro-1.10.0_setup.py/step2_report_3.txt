  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup script, reading version info, configuring extensions, no external data flow, no obfuscation, no malware.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, using regex and ast.literal_eval to parse version info, which is safe here. No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate; the code is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard setup procedures, no untrusted data handling, no suspicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The code reads local files, processes data statically, no dynamic code execution or external communication.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the small securityRisk is acceptable given the file reads, but nothing suspicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup, reads version info with regex and AST, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution. The use of 'assert' could be a minor concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign; scores are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard setup, no suspicious code, uses 'assert' for version parsing.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; 'assert' could be a point of failure but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe; scores fit.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup, no external data fetching or dynamic code execution, reads static files, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** All operations are typical; no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior; scores are zero.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; scores are zero.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) due to file reads and version parsing, but these are standard practices in setup scripts.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- The code is a typical, well-structured setup script.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The small security risk score (0.1) is justified given file reading operations, but these are standard and safe.\n\n**Final scores I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to file operations, but very low risk)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate, and the code is safe. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.",
