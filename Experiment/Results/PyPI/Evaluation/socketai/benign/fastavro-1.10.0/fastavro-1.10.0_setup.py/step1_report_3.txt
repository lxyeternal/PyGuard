{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and configures the packaging of the 'fastavro' Python library, including compiling extension modules and extracting version information.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'fastavro/__init__.py', reads 'README.md' for long description, reads files for extension modules, and reads package data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe file operations if file paths are manipulated, but none are shown here. No untrusted data is directly used in critical sinks such as network, environment variables, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a source file, uses regex and AST parsing to process data, and supplies static configuration for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code mainly handles standard setup tasks with no unusual code or obfuscation. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, including determining extension modules based on the environment, reading version info from a source file using regex and AST parsing, and configuring package metadata. No malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or malicious side-effects are evident. It does not include network calls, cryptography, or environment variable manipulation, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malware. The code appears to be a legitimate package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration with no indications of malicious activity or security risks. It securely reads version info and package data without untrusted inputs or harmful behaviors.",
