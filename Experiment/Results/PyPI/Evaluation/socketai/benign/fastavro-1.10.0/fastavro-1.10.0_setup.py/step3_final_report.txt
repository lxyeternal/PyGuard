  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the fastavro Python package, configuring extensions, reading version info, and setting package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'fastavro/__init__.py' using regex and ast.literal_eval; reads 'README.md' for long description; imports setup and extension modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmission; local file reads only.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local file to set package version; reads README for description; configures extensions based on environment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert' for version parsing could be a minor point of failure if source is maliciously altered, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It conditionally compiles Cython extensions, reads version info via regex and 'ast.literal_eval', and sets package metadata. No external network activity, dynamic code execution from untrusted sources, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of 'assert' for version extraction is a minor concern but not malicious. All operations are static and standard for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, benign setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), primarily due to file reading operations. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy.",
