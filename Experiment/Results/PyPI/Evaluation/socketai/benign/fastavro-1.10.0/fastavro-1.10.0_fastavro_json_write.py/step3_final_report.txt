{
  "purpose": "A wrapper function that serializes records to a JSON stream according to a provided schema, delegating actual writing to an external 'writer' function with configurable options.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'fo' (file-like object), 'schema', and 'records'; configuration flags; external modules 'writer' and 'AvroJSONEncoder'.",
  "sinks": "Delegated to the external 'writer' function; no direct untrusted data sinks within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from 'records' through the 'writer' function, with configuration via 'encoder' and options, ultimately writing to 'fo'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is a straightforward wrapper with clear documentation and no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-documented wrapper around external serialization modules, with no embedded malicious logic, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. It delegates core functionality to imported modules, which are assumed standard and benign. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks are present. The external modules' trustworthiness is assumed, and the code's purpose is purely serialization, making it inherently low risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, transparent serialization wrapper with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and do not require adjustments.",
