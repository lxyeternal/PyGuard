{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and classes for reading and processing Avro data files and streams, including schema resolution, data decoding, and support for various compression codecs.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input streams or file-like objects, including headers, schema definitions, and data blocks, as well as environment variables for optional dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points are not explicitly present; the code reads and processes data but does not transmit or store untrusted data externally.",
  "flows": "Reads header -> decodes schema -> reads data blocks -> processes data according to schema -> outputs records or blocks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns identified. Use of optional compression libraries is standard and handled gracefully. No signs of obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code adheres to standard patterns for reading Avro files, including schema parsing, logical type handling, and optional compression codecs. There are no indications of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage. All external library usage appears legitimate and optional. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic is present. The code’s complexity is consistent with an open-source data reader library. No anomalies suggesting sabotage or malware are found.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of an Avro data reader with extensive schema resolution and compression support. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage patterns. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to standard data processing functions.",
