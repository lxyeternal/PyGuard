  "purpose": "Python AVRO data reading and schema resolution, supporting multiple codecs and optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input stream reading bytes, optional codec libraries for decompression",
  "sinks": "Data decoding functions, schema resolution paths, optional decompression routines",
  "flows": "Input stream -> decoder -> schema resolution -> decompression (if any) -> data deserialization",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors; standard handling of optional dependencies",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured AVRO data parser with support for multiple codecs, schema resolution, and logical types. It handles optional dependencies safely with fallbacks and warnings. No malicious behaviors, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The data flow is straightforward, with no signs of data exfiltration or malicious injection. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard open-source AVRO reader with no malicious or suspicious features. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
