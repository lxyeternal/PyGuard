{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports a module (_logical_readers) and exposes a LOGICAL_READERS variable for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially the import of _logical_readers and _logical_readers_py modules.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to LOGICAL_READERS and export via __all__.",
  "flows": "Import _logical_readers -> Access LOGICAL_READERS -> Expose LOGICAL_READERS in __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import with fallback, which is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a module named _logical_readers. If this import fails, it falls back to importing _logical_readers_py, which is a common pattern for handling optional or platform-specific modules. It then assigns LOGICAL_READERS from the imported module and exposes it via __all__, a standard Python practice for module exports. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code is straightforward and typical for modular Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard dynamic import pattern with fallback, without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply loads and exposes a module variable. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
