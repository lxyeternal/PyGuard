  "purpose": "Import a module or fallback to an alternative module for logical readers and expose LOGICAL_READERS for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the current package (__import__ mechanism) to load _logical_readers or _logical_readers_py",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations; only module import and attribute exposure",
  "flows": "Import attempts flow from the module to the LOGICAL_READERS variable, then exposure via __all__",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports, conditional import fallback, no hardcoded credentials or data manipulation, straightforward module import logic",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import a module named _logical_readers. If it fails, it imports a fallback module _logical_readers_py. The LOGICAL_READERS variable is assigned from the imported module's attribute. The __all__ list exposes LOGICAL_READERS for external access. The import pattern with fallback is common for handling optional or platform-specific modules. No obfuscated code, no data leakage, or suspicious behavior detected. No input sources or potential data sinks are present. The code appears to be a standard module import pattern with a fallback option.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import mechanism with fallback and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages module imports and exposes a variable. There are no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
