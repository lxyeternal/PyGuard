  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Original Code Recap:**\n```python\ntry:\n    from . import _logical_readers\nexcept ImportError:\n    from . import _logical_readers_py as _logical_readers  # type: ignore\n\nLOGICAL_READERS = _logical_readers.LOGICAL_READERS\n\n__all__ = [\"LOGICAL_READERS\"]\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code performs a standard import with a fallback, which is common for optional or version-dependent modules.\n- No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The variable `LOGICAL_READERS` is assigned from the imported module, then exposed.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears to be a compatibility pattern, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the purpose as a fallback import for compatibility. No malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, straightforward import with fallback, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Also correct; notes the fallback import pattern and absence of malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (slightly higher, but still very low)\n- **Assessment:** The security risk score is marginally increased but still negligible. The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity detected.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Identifies the import pattern as standard, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard fallback import, no anomalies.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency:\nAll reports agree that this is a benign, standard import pattern with no malicious intent or security issues. The only minor variation is the security risk score in Report 3, which is slightly elevated but still very low and justified given the fallback import pattern—though this pattern is common and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. No signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the straightforward nature and absence of malicious activity, a risk score of around 0.0 to 0.1 seems appropriate.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the fallback import pattern, but not a real security concern)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a benign, standard pattern for optional module import with fallback. No changes to the scores are necessary, and the overall assessment aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, with negligible security risk, and should not be flagged for malware or obfuscation.",
