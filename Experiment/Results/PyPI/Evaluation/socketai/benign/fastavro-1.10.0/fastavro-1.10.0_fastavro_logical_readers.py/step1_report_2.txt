{
  "purpose": "This code attempts to import a module (_logical_readers) and fallback to an alternative (_logical_readers_py) if the first import fails, then exposes LOGICAL_READERS from the imported module.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load modules: 'from . import _logical_readers' and 'from . import _logical_readers_py as _logical_readers'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: attempt to import a module, fallback if necessary, then assign LOGICAL_READERS for external use.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a fallback import suggests modular or version-dependent code, but no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs conditional importing based on import success, a common Python pattern for compatibility or optional dependencies. It then assigns an attribute from the module to a constant for external access. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling that could be malicious. The only notable aspect is the fallback import mechanism, which is benign and typical in package design.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward module import with a fallback and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard practice for handling optional or version-specific modules.",
