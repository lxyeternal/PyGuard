  "purpose": "Module imports a logical readers component, with a fallback import for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements, potentially dynamic import fallback.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points detected; only module imports and assignment.",
  "flows": "Import source flows into LOGICAL_READERS variable.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a module _logical_readers. If the import fails, it imports _logical_readers_py as a fallback. The LOGICAL_READERS variable is assigned from the imported module. The use of fallback import enhances compatibility but does not introduce malicious behavior. The code does not process untrusted data, execute dynamic code, or access sensitive information. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import module with a fallback mechanism, which appears to be intended for compatibility purposes. There are no signs of malicious activity, security risks, or anomalies in this code.",
