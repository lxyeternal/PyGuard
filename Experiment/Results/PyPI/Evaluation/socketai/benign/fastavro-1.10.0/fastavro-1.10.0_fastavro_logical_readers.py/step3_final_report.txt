{
  "purpose": "This code attempts to import a module '_logical_readers' and falls back to '_logical_readers_py' if the import fails, then exposes LOGICAL_READERS.",
  "sources": "The import statements, which read the module '_logical_readers' or '_logical_readers_py'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external communications, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import attempt from current package, fallback import, assignment to LOGICAL_READERS, exposure via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard try-except import pattern for optional dependencies, common in Python packages for compatibility. It assigns a variable from the imported module and exposes it. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The fallback import is a typical pattern, not inherently risky. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for optional dependency handling with fallback. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
