  "purpose": "Import and expose the LOGICAL_READERS object from a local module or its fallback implementation.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing _logical_readers or _logical_readers_py modules.",

  "flows": "Import from local modules → assignment to LOGICAL_READERS → export via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard pattern for fallback imports. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a module named _logical_readers. If the import fails, it falls back to _logical_readers_py. It then assigns LOGICAL_READERS from the imported module and exposes it via __all__. This is a common pattern to handle optional or platform-specific implementations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as hidden backdoors, code injection, or data leakage. The code is straightforward, with no unusual constructs or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import pattern with a fallback and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. It safely exposes LOGICAL_READERS for external use.",
