  "purpose": "The code provides example usage and imports for the fastavro library to read and write Avro files.",
  "sources": "Import statements and assignment of functions from the fastavro library.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data or external output mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only defines functions and example usage without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears to be straightforward library setup and usage examples.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and functions from the 'fastavro' library and assigns them to local variables for convenience. It also includes example usage comments but does not execute any untrusted data processing or network operations. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious commands, or unusual behaviors present. The structure is simple, and all operations are standard for a data processing library.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, serving as a usage example and import setup for the fastavro library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be legitimate library setup and documentation example code.",
