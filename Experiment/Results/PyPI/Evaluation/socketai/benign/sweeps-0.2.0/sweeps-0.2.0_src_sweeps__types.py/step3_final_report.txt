  "purpose": "Define type aliases for numerical data types for static type checking in Python, mainly for numpy compatibility.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing and numpy; type alias definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; static type aliases do not process untrusted data at runtime.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or runtime logic present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'Any' for 'ArrayLike' reduces type safety; acknowledged in comments but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static type alias module for numerical types, with no runtime behavior or data handling. The use of 'Any' for 'ArrayLike' is a known workaround for mypy's limitations, explicitly documented, and not malicious. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code and assign appropriate scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and serves purely for static type checking. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are justified and consistent with the code's purpose.",
