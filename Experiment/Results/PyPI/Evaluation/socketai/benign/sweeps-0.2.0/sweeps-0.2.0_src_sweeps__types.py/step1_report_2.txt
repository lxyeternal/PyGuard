{
  "purpose": "Define custom type aliases for type-checking in numerical computations, mainly for use with type hints in Python code.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; type definitions are static and do not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations involving untrusted data or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow involving untrusted inputs or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'Any' for ArrayLike type, which can weaken type safety but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing and numpy modules to create type aliases. 'floating' and 'integer' are unions of built-in and numpy scalar types, which is typical for numerical type annotations. The 'ArrayLike' alias is set to 'Any', which is a placeholder to bypass strict type checking; this is a known workaround, not malicious. Comments indicate ongoing work to improve type annotations. No external data reading, suspicious behavior, or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, serves as type definitions for numerical data, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The use of 'Any' in 'ArrayLike' is a common practice for flexibility, not malicious intent.",
