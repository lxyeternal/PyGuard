{
  "purpose": "Define custom type aliases for type-checking related to numerical data in sweeps, mainly for static analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' and 'numpy'; type annotations using Union.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code only defines type aliases.",
  "flows": "Type aliases are assigned but not used; no data flow occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only provides type definitions. The 'ArrayLike' alias is overly generic (set to Any), which could weaken type safety but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines type aliases for 'floating', 'integer', and 'ArrayLike'. The aliases for 'floating' and 'integer' combine built-in and numpy types, which is common for numerical data handling. The 'ArrayLike' is set to 'Any', with a commented-out alternative that suggests better type specificity was considered. There is no usage of untrusted inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no external data interaction. The purpose appears to be static type checking support. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or security breaches.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining type aliases to improve static analysis and type safety in numerical computations. It contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no anomalies indicative of sabotage.",
