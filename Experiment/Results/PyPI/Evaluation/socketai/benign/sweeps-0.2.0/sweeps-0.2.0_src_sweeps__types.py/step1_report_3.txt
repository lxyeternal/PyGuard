  "purpose": "Define custom type aliases for type-checking in numerical computations, primarily for use with the 'sweeps' module.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code defines type aliases locally.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from source to sink as no input/output handling exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward type alias definitions. The commented TODO suggests future improvements but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type annotations and numpy, then defines type aliases for floating point and integer types, including numpy-specific types. It also defines a generic ArrayLike as Any, with a comment about mypy's strictness. There are no input handling, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be for static type hints only. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple type alias setup intended for type-checking, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any runtime operations or data handling that could be exploited.",
