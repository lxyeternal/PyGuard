  "purpose": "Define custom type aliases for type-checking in the context of numerical computations.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data dynamically.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or output is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only declares type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and solely for type aliasing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing and numpy modules, then defines type aliases for floating point and integer types, utilizing Union with numpy-specific types. It also sets ArrayLike to Any, with a comment about mypy compatibility issues. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. The code appears to be a simple type declaration module intended for static type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It serves solely as a type annotation utility for static analysis. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
