{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for managing and analyzing machine learning sweep runs, including run state management, metric calculations, and search/stop strategies.",
  "sources": "Data sources include run configurations, history logs, summary metrics, and environment variables accessed via external libraries such as numpy and pydantic.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data outputs like metrics, histories, and configurations, but no evidence of untrusted input/output handling that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-provided configurations and historical run data through functions that calculate metrics or suggest new runs; no untrusted external data is read or written in an unsafe manner.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed. Usage of external libraries is standard and appropriate for the context.",
  "analysis": "The code performs structured data management for sweep runs, including validation, metric extraction, and search strategies. It uses standard libraries like numpy and pydantic with no dynamic code execution or external command calls. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears focused on valid, domain-specific operations for machine learning experiment management.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the detailed review, the code is standard for its application domain, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily handles data processing and scheduling logic securely. The overall security risk is low.",
