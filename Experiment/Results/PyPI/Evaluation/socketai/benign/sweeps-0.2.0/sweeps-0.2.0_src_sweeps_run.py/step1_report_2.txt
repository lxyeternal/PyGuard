{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for managing and analyzing machine learning sweep runs, including status tracking, metric analysis, and next/stop run suggestions.",
  "sources": "Reads include input parameters such as 'sweep_config', 'runs', 'metric_name', and data within SweepRun instances (history, summary_metrics).",
  "sinks": "Methods access run data for metric calculations and configuration validation but do not write or transmit untrusted data or perform external network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., 'sweep_config', run histories) flows into functions that perform validation, selection, or stopping logic, without executing untrusted code or transmitting data externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic code execution detected. All code appears standard for a data management utility.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles data validation, status checking, and selection logic for sweep runs. It imports standard libraries and uses internal modules for sweep configuration and search strategies. The functions involve data validation, metric calculations, and controlling sweep flow, with no network operations, dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behaviors. Usage of numpy and pydantic is standard, and no hardcoded secrets are found. The code does not perform any potentially malicious actions such as data exfiltration or system modification.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate part of a machine learning experiment management system, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily manages sweep configurations and run states without external or hidden harmful behaviors.",
