{
  "purpose": "The code manages ML sweep runs, including their states, metrics, configurations, and search strategies, facilitating experiment orchestration and analysis.",
  "sources": "Configurations, run history logs, summary metrics, and environment variables within the codebase.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures and computations; no external data transmission or file/network operations observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from configurations and histories to metrics calculations, search functions, and run state updates, all within the system.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries (numpy, pydantic) for data validation and modeling. It handles run states, metrics, and sweep strategies without external interactions. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated constructs are present. The logic is straightforward, focusing on data management and decision-making for ML experiments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical ML experiment management module with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It is well-structured, transparent, and safe for use.",
