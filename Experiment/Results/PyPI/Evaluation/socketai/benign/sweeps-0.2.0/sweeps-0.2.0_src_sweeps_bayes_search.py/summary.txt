  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of Bayesian optimization routines with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.2) reflects the inherent low risk of such routines, which could be misused if misconfigured but are not malicious in themselves."
