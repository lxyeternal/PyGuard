  "purpose": "This code provides functions for Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, including Gaussian process fitting, sampling strategies, and run suggestion logic for a sweep-based machine learning experiment.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters such as 'sample_X', 'sample_y', 'runs', and 'config'. It processes run states, metrics, and bounds within these parameters.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially flow into the 'suggested_X' values, but these are generated internally via statistical models and random sampling; no external untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Sources include run metrics, run states, and configuration; data flows through sampling, Gaussian process fitting, acquisition function calculations, and finally into suggested hyperparameters for new runs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious or malicious code such as network connections, file manipulations, or reverse shells are detected. Use of random sampling and Gaussian process models is standard for Bayesian optimization. The code does not contain obfuscated language or unnecessary dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Bayesian optimization techniques using Gaussian processes, expected improvement, and random sampling within parameter bounds. It carefully handles different run states, imputing metrics for failed or in-progress runs. No external network or system modification code is present. All computations and data flows are consistent with intended modeling workflows. No anomalous or malicious patterns are detected; the code appears to be a legitimate implementation of hyperparameter search algorithms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured implementation of Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms. Its purpose is to suggest the next experimental run based on statistical modeling, with standard safety precautions. Overall, there is no evidence of malware or security risks.",
