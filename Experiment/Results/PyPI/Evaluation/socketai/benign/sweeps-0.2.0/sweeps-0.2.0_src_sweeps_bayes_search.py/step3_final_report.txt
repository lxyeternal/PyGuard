  "purpose": "Implementation of Bayesian optimization routines, including Gaussian process fitting, sampling, and run suggestion, for hyperparameter tuning.",
  "sources": "Data inputs from run objects, configurations, and sampling functions; internal data flow within functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network calls, or system modifications; data remains within internal processing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input runs and configurations through Gaussian process modeling, sampling, and optimization routines to produce suggested hyperparameters.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, sklearn) for Gaussian process modeling, sampling, and Bayesian optimization. It handles data carefully, performs validation, and uses well-known algorithms without obfuscation or malicious constructs. No external communication or system modifications are present. The logic is straightforward, and the routines are typical for hyperparameter tuning tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of Bayesian optimization routines with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.2) reflects the inherent low risk of such routines, which could be misused if misconfigured but are not malicious in themselves.",
