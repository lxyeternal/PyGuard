{
  "purpose": "The code manages hyperparameter grid search for machine learning experiment sweeps, generating new run configurations based on parameter grids.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, including sweep configurations, existing runs, and parameter values. It also reads environment variables implicitly via imports, but none are used explicitly.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks are present; the code generates new run configurations and hashes parameter values but does not perform network I/O, file writing, or system commands.",
  "flows": "The code flows from input parameters -> validation and conversion of sweep configs -> generation of parameter combinations -> filtering out previously used configurations -> creation of new SweepRun instances with updated configs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard with no unusual code constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. It uses predictable hashing and data structures, and no obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs validation, parameter transformation, and combination generation for grid search; it relies on standard libraries and well-defined data flow. No malicious activity, such as network communication, system modifications, or data exfiltration, is detected. It does not handle sensitive data or credentials. No signs of obfuscation or covert mechanisms are present. The functions seem purpose-specific and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate component for managing hyperparameter grid searches with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs expected tasks within its scope and does not contain malicious code or security risks.",
