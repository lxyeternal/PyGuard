{
  "purpose": "The code implements a grid search algorithm for hyperparameter optimization, generating suggested runs based on parameter combinations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the parameters of the sweep configuration, existing runs, and optional validation flags. Uses the 'runs' list and 'sweep_config' input.",
  "sinks": "Generates new SweepRun objects with configurations. No sinks process untrusted data directly; no network or file I/O, no command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Flow involves reading sweep configuration and existing runs, generating parameter combinations, and producing new SweepRun instances with those configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or suspicious control flow. Use of numpy and yaml appears standard. No malicious indicators observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard parameter combination generation for grid search, including conversion of certain parameter types to categorical. It validates input configurations, constructs Cartesian products of parameter values, and filters out already-searched combinations. The functions and classes used seem typical for hyperparameter tuning workflows. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. External libraries are used normally; no suspicious network or file activity. The overall logic aligns with a typical grid search implementation, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate component for hyperparameter search, with no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard implementation for generating hyperparameter combinations and creating corresponding sweep runs.",
