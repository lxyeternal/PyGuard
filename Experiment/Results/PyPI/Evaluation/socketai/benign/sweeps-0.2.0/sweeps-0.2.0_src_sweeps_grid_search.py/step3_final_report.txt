{
  "purpose": "Implements a grid search for hyperparameter tuning, generating parameter combinations, validating configurations, and creating SweepRun objects without external communication.",
  "sources": "Reads sweep configuration, existing runs, and parameter definitions; uses hashing for deduplication.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; internal configuration and object creation only.",
  "flows": "Source data (configurations, previous runs) flows into parameter validation, hashing, combination generation, and into new SweepRun objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard hyperparameter grid search: validating configs, converting parameter types, generating Cartesian products, filtering out previously seen configurations, and creating new run objects. It uses common libraries appropriately, with hashing for deduplication and optional randomization. No network activity, file I/O, or code execution based on untrusted input is present. The scoring in the reports aligns with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of hyperparameter grid search with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be minimal (~0.0 to 0.2). Given the analysis, the most appropriate final scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0.",
