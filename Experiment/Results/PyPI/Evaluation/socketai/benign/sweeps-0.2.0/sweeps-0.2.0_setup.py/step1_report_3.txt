{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'sweeps'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is used in a way that leads to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Input files ('requirements.txt', 'README.md') are read and used for package metadata; no untrusted data flows into executable code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files for requirements and readme content, then calls setuptools.setup() with package information and dependencies. No external input is processed at runtime, and no suspicious or malicious code execution occurs. Usage of 'requirements.txt' and 'README.md' is typical for package setup. No sources or sinks involve untrusted user input or external data that could lead to security risks. The code structure and content align with standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security concerns. It only reads static files and configures package metadata. No anomalies or malware are detected.",
