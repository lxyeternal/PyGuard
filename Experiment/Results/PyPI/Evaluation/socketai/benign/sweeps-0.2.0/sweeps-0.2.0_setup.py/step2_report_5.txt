  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the details with the provided code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools.\n- It reads 'requirements.txt' and 'README.md' files to populate setup parameters.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or data leaks are evident.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly reads external files and uses them in setup(). No issues are detected in the code logic.\n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports find any malicious behavior. The malware score is consistently 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present; obfuscated score is 0.\n- **Security risks:** Given the static nature and lack of dynamic execution, the security risk score should remain very low.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of scores:\n\n**Malware score:**\n- All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code is standard and safe.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**\n- All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n**Risk score:**\n- All reports assign a very low risk score (0.1 or 0), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Confidence:**\n- All reports have high confidence (1), which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.  \n- **Any overestimation of risk?**  \n  No. The risk scores are appropriately low, considering the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: **0**  \n  - Obfuscated: **0**  \n  - Risk: **0.1** (or 0, but 0.1 is acceptable for minimal residual risk in package setup scripts)\n\n- **Additional notes:**  \n  The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, safe Python package setup script. The reports are accurate, and their scoring reflects the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0.1**  \n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
