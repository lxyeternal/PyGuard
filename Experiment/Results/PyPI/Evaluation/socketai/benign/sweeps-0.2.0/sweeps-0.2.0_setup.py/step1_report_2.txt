{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'sweeps' Python package, primarily for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable misuse detected.",
  "flows": "Reads external files for requirements and readme; passes dependencies and package info to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads dependencies and metadata from external files, then invokes setup() with package info. All operations are standard for Python package setup and do not involve untrusted data processing or malicious code. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. Usage of 'setuptools' and file reads are typical and safe. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided code.",
