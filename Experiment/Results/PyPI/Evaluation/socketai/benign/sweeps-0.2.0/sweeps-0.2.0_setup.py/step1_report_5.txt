{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package called 'sweeps', including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies; reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data sinks; no network or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading files into variables, then into setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads dependencies and description files, then invokes setuptools.setup() with package metadata. All operations are standard for Python package setup. No code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. External inputs are limited to reading static files, which are controlled and not malicious. No network activity, credential handling, or suspicious code flow is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs standard operations for package configuration and includes no signs of malware or security risks.",
