{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for the 'sweeps' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and package details.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None of the data read from files is directly used in a manner that leads to untrusted code execution or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reads requirements and readme files, uses their content for setup parameters, then proceeds with package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no unusual code patterns or obfuscated code. Use of 'open' is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, reads dependencies from an external text file, reads package description from README, and configures package setup with metadata and requirements. There are no suspicious code patterns, no use of eval, exec, or dynamic imports. No network activity or sensitive data handling occurs. The code appears to be a standard package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It reads external files to populate setup parameters in a typical manner.",
