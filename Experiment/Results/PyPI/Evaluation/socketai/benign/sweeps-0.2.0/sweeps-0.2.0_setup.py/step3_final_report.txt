  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads dependencies and description files, then invokes setuptools.setup() with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' and 'README.md' files; static data passed to setup()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external outputs beyond file reads",
  "flows": "File reads for requirements and readme, then static data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static file reading and setup invocation",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, network activity, or handling of sensitive data. It reads static files and passes their contents to setup(). No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk in reading static files. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality. No modifications are necessary.",
