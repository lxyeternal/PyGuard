  "purpose": "Generate hyperparameter sweep runs by sampling parameters randomly from specified distributions, based on a configuration.",
  "sources": "Input configuration dictionary or SweepConfig object, specifically 'method' and 'parameters' fields.",
  "sinks": "Creates instances of SweepRun with sampled configurations; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Validation of sweep_config -> parameter extraction -> sampling each parameter -> constructing SweepRun with new config.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs configuration validation if requested, checks that the method is 'random', extracts hyperparameters, samples their values, and creates SweepRun objects. It relies on external modules for configuration and object management, but these are standard and do not introduce security risks. No network activity, file I/O, or dynamic code execution is present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical hyperparameter search implementations. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for hyperparameter sampling with no malicious behavior or security issues. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
