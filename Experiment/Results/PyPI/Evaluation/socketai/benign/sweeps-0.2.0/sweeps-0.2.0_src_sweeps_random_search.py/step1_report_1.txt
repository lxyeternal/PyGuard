{
  "purpose": "The function generates suggested hyperparameter sweep runs with randomly sampled parameter values based on a given configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'sweep_config' parameter, environment variables (indirectly via imported modules), and the configuration schemas.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a list of 'SweepRun' objects. No untrusted data is written to external systems or files, and there are no network operations or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input 'sweep_config' -> validation (if enabled) -> parameter sampling -> creation of 'SweepRun' objects -> return.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The code relies on external classes and modules for core operations, which appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs configuration validation and generates a list of 'SweepRun' objects with randomized parameters. It uses well-defined class methods and standard Python structures. No evidence of obfuscated code, malicious data exfiltration, or harmful operations. The only potential concern is reliance on external modules, but these are typical for such tasks. The logic is straightforward and intended for hyperparameter tuning without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a hyperparameter search utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses common patterns for configuration validation and data handling in machine learning workflows.",
