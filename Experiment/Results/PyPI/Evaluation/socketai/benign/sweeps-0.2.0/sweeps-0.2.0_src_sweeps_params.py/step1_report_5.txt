{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for managing hyperparameters in a hyperparameter search framework, including distribution sampling, configuration handling, and conversion between parameter representations.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data for hyperparameters from dictionaries, and input values for distribution functions (e.g., via method parameters like 'x' in ppf and cdf).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present that handle untrusted data for critical operations like network connections, file access, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from configuration sources into HyperParameter objects; distribution functions compute percentile points; normalization functions process run data; no source-to-sink malicious data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures are observed. The code employs standard statistical distributions and configuration validation. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical implementation of a hyperparameter management system, including statistical sampling and distribution calculations. It uses well-known libraries (numpy, scipy) and adheres to expected patterns for such systems. There are no signs of malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions and classes perform standard validation, sampling, and configuration handling. No suspicious code paths or hidden malicious logic are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, intended for hyperparameter configuration and sampling within a search framework. It contains no indicators of malware or malicious behavior. The risk is minimal, primarily involving potential misconfiguration if used improperly, but nothing malicious is evident.",
