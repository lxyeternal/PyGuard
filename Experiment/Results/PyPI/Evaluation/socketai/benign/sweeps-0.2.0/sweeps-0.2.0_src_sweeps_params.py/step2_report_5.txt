  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code**: All reports describe the code as handling hyperparameters, distributions, sampling, and configuration management. No report indicates actual bugs, vulnerabilities, or malicious code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes**: None of the reports identify logical errors or security flaws. They all acknowledge standard statistical operations and configuration handling.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues**: All reports assign malware scores of 0, indicating no malware detected. Security risks are low (around 0.1 to 0.2), which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Malware justification**: The code only performs statistical sampling, configuration validation, and nested dict handling. No network activity, code injection, or system modifications are present. The sampling functions (ppf, cdf) and distribution calculations are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions**: All reports correctly interpret the code as standard hyperparameter management routines. No unwarranted assumptions about malicious behavior are made.\n\n6. **Score consistency**: The assigned scores seem appropriate given the benign analysis. The malware scores are all zero, and security risks are minimal, aligning with the detailed assessments.\n\n**Overall conclusion**:\n- The code is a typical, well-structured implementation for hyperparameter configuration, sampling, and normalization.\n- No malicious or obfuscated behavior is evident.\n- The use of random sampling and statistical functions is standard for such frameworks.\n- No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or sabotage are present.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score**: **0** — code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard libraries.\n- **Risk score**: **0.1** — minimal security concern, mainly related to potential misconfiguration, but no active threat.\n\n### Final notes:\nThe code appears safe, legitimate, and suitable for its purpose. The high confidence levels in the reports are justified, and no changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0.1\n\nAll indicators confirm the code is benign with no malicious intent.",
