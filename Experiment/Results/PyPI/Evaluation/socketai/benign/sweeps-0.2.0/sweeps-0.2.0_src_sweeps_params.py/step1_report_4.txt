{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions for managing hyperparameters in a search or optimization process, including sampling, cdf/ppf transformations, and configuration handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters, configuration dictionaries, and input data for statistical distributions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if sensitive information is stored in configuration or passed into functions; however, no explicit data exfiltration or network activity is present.",
  "flows": "Inputs from configuration or data are processed through distribution functions and class methods; data flows through cdf, ppf, sample, and to_config methods without external influence, indicating standard statistical handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, hidden backdoors, or malicious system calls, are detected. The code primarily performs statistical sampling, data transformations, and configuration processing.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard statistical methods for hyperparameter sampling, distribution cdf/ppf calculations, and configuration handling. The usage of numpy, scipy.stats, and JSON schema validation appears legitimate. There are no indications of data exfiltration, network communication, or malicious system manipulations. The functions and classes serve typical roles in hyperparameter search frameworks, with no suspicious or malicious constructs. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious side effects are detected. The code adheres to common practices for such systems and does not perform any operations outside of statistical and configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation for hyperparameter management in search algorithms. It does not contain any malicious or sabotage behavior. The functions and classes are designed for statistical sampling, configuration validation, and parameter normalization, all within expected patterns. Overall, it is safe from a security perspective based on the provided content.",
