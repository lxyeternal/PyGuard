{
  "purpose": "The code manages hyperparameters, supports various distributions, performs sampling, validation, and configuration serialization for hyperparameter optimization workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration dictionaries, input parameters for distributions, and nested parameter definitions.",
  "sinks": "Internal sampling functions, configuration serialization, and nested dict creation; no external data transmission or malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows into HyperParameter objects, which generate samples via ppf functions; nested configurations are reconstructed during to_config serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Uses standard libraries and statistical methods.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive implementation of hyperparameter management, including various distribution types, sampling, and configuration nesting. It employs standard scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, jsonschema) without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated segments. The sampling functions (ppf, cdf) are mathematically correct and typical for hyperparameter search routines. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The configuration validation and nesting are standard practices, and the code is readable and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard hyperparameter management module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's functionality.",
