  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for sweep configuration, importing classes and functions related to validation and schema handling.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and functions from local package files (.cfg and .schema), which are likely internal dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations such as network access or data leakage.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions and classes; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present. All code consists of imports and an __all__ declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules and defines an explicit __all__ list for exports. It appears to be a straightforward module setup without any logic, input handling, or potentially malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module interface declaration with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign package setup.",
