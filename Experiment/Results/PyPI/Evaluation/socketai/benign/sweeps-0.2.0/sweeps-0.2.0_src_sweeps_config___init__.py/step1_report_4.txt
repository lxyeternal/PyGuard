  "purpose": "This code defines an interface for sweep configuration, including importing classes and functions related to validation and schema handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .cfg and .schema",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output or external communication observed",
  "flows": "Imports are used for internal functionality; no data flow from untrusted sources or external inputs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward with standard import and export statements",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific classes and functions from local modules and defines an __all__ list for exports. No external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be part of a larger, standard Python package for configuration validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module defining an interface with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply re-exports certain components from other modules for use elsewhere.",
