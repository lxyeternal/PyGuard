  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for sweep configuration, importing classes and functions from local modules for validation and schema handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .cfg and .schema",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data processing points that handle untrusted input; the code only imports and re-exports functions and classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely structural and organizational.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. The code is straightforward and standard for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module that imports specific classes and functions from local modules and defines an __all__ list for export. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing. It does not include any obfuscated code or potentially malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign module that solely manages imports and exports for a larger package. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this fragment.",
