{
  "purpose": "This module provides an interface for sweep configuration, importing classes and functions related to schema validation and parameter filling.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and functions from local package files (.cfg and .schema), which are source points for the functionalities used in this module.",
  "sinks": "The code exports certain classes and functions via __all__, but there are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows involving untrusted input or external data manipulation; the module only imports and re-exports components.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with standard Python import and export statements; no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical interface module that imports specific components from local submodules and defines __all__ for export. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. The functions and classes imported are likely utility or validation functions, and there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious operations. The code structure is simple, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a clean interface to other modules. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It simply organizes and exposes functionality for sweep configuration and schema validation.",
