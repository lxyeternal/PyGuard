{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define an interface for sweep configuration management, including imports and exporting functions and classes related to schema validation and parameter filling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.cfg and .schema). No data input or external sources are present.",
  "targets": "No explicit targets or sinks; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow is evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code mainly consists of imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific classes and functions from local modules and re-exports them for external use. There are no runtime operations, no data processing, and no external inputs or outputs. The code structure is straightforward and standard for Python modules, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard interface module with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior detected. It serves as a clean and typical component for a larger configuration management system.",
