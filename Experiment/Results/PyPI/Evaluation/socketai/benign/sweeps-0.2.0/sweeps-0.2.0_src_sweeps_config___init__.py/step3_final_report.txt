{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface module that imports specific classes and functions from local submodules (.cfg and .schema) and re-exports them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from .cfg and .schema modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; purely static import/export statements",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only organizes and exposes components",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; straightforward import/export pattern",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports specific components from local modules and defines __all__ for export. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The structure is typical for a package interface, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard interface module with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
