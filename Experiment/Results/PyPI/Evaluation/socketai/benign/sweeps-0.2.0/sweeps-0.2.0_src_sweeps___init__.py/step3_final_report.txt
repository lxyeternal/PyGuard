{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports specific configuration and runtime classes/functions from local modules and sets a version string, likely for initialization or setup within a larger package.",
  "sources": "Imports from .config and .run modules, and the version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements and a version string. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of this code snippet. Slight variations in risk scores (e.g., 0.1) are acceptable given the potential for imported modules to handle untrusted data internally, but the code itself remains safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
