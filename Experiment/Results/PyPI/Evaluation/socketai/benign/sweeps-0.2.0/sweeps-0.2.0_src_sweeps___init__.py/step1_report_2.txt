{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package, primarily importing configuration and runtime management components related to a 'Sweep' process.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .config (SweepConfig, schema_violations_from_proposed_config), .run (RunState, SweepRun, next_run, next_runs, stop_runs)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks observed; the code imports modules but does not process untrusted data or execute external commands",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static and do not handle runtime data",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns; the __version__ string is a standard package version indicator",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from local modules, indicating modular design. No input/output handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The version string is standard for package versioning and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization segment, importing configuration and runtime components with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
