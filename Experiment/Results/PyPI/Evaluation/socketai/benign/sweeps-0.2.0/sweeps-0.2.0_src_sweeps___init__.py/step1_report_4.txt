{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules for configuration and execution management, and defines a version string.",
  "sources": "Imports from .config and .run modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms observed",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; code mainly establishes references to functions and classes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code patterns; use of noqa suggests suppression of linting issues but not malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements and a version assignment. It does not include any data input, processing, or output logic. The imports suggest dependencies on local modules for configuration and runtime operations. The version string is a standard practice and contains no embedded secrets or malicious code. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to be a straightforward module setup with imports and version declaration. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation are detected. It is a benign piece of code typical in modular Python projects.",
