  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their assessments, as well as their scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, straightforward imports, version string.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** Correct. The code is simple, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The high confidence score (1) is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious activity, standard package code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** Correct. No issues detected. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, noting that imported modules could process untrusted data, but the snippet itself is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Justification:** Given that the code only imports modules and sets a version string, and no data processing occurs here, a risk score of 0.1 seems a bit high. It might be more appropriate to set this to 0 unless there's evidence that the imported modules are malicious or handle untrusted data insecurely. The malware score remains 0, which is correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, straightforward imports, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** Correct. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, minimal code, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of observations:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The only minor point is Report 3's assigned security risk score of 0.1, which might be slightly overstated given the code snippet alone.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** All should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All should be 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 for all, since the code is just imports and version declaration, with no processing or handling of untrusted data in this fragment.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The code is a standard, benign module setup with no security issues.\n- No changes needed to the malware or obfuscated scores.\n- The security risk score should be 0 across the board.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the code's simplicity.",
