{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a package's module that imports specific classes and functions from local modules and sets a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.config and .run)",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling occurring in this snippet",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to module imports; no untrusted data handling or flow present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of import statements and a version string assignment. It imports classes and functions likely used elsewhere in the package. There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable code that could pose security risks. The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or system modifications. As such, it does not exhibit malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple module import and version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and standard for package modules.",
