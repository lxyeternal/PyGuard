  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward import and version declaration, with no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.5 (reported as 0). Given the absence of any suspicious activity, a security risk score of 0 is justified.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code only imports local modules with no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.5 (reported as 0). Again, justified.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** The code performs only imports and version setting, with a note that imported modules could handle untrusted data internally.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (reported as 0.1). Since the code itself is benign but acknowledges potential risks in imported modules, a low but non-zero security risk score is reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** The cautious approach is appropriate; no malicious activity is indicated.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—simple imports and version string.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0 (reported as 0). Fully justified.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same minimal import pattern with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0 (reported as 0). Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk Score:** Most are 0, with one report at 0.1 due to the possibility that imported modules could process untrusted data internally. This cautious score is reasonable given the limited context.\n\n### Additional Recommendations:\n- Since the code is purely import statements and version declaration, the overall **malware** and **obfuscated** scores should remain at **0**.\n- The **security risk** score can stay at **0** for the majority, with a slight increase (up to 0.1) if considering potential internal behaviors of imported modules, but given the current code snippet, 0 is justified.\n\n### Final Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the evidence and the logic presented in all reports.",
