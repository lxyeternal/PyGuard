{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for combining multiple text map propagators for context propagation in OpenTelemetry.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'carrier' objects during extract and inject methods, which are inputs for context propagation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are evident; the code could write to 'carrier' objects during inject.",
  "flows": "Input 'carrier' flows into the extract and inject methods, which process it via configured propagators; the context is passed and modified during these processes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs are present. The use of deprecated decorator is noted but not suspicious. No obfuscation or malicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a clean, straightforward implementation of a composite propagator pattern for OpenTelemetry, allowing multiple propagators to work together for extracting and injecting context. It adheres to standard patterns without any signs of malicious behavior. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. Use of deprecated decorator is benign and only indicates a versioning note.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and serves as a utility for context propagation. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
