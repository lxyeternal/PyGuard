  "purpose": "Provides a mechanism for combining multiple text map propagators into a single entity for context extraction and injection in OpenTelemetry.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'carrier' during extract and inject methods, accessing propagator fields.",
  "sinks": "Writes to 'carrier' during inject, potentially affecting external data such as HTTP headers.",
  "flows": "Sequentially calls extract and inject on each configured propagator, passing the same carrier and context.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code; use of deprecated decorator is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard composite pattern for propagators, with straightforward extract and inject methods. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The use of deprecated decorator indicates versioning but does not impact security. No obfuscation or malicious logic detected. The data flow is limited to in-memory context and carrier manipulation, typical for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a composite propagator for OpenTelemetry, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
