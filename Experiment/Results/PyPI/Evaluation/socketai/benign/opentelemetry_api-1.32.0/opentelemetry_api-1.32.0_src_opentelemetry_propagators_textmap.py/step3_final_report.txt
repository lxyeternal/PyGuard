{
  "purpose": "Defines interfaces and default implementations for context propagation in distributed tracing, facilitating extraction and injection of context data into carriers such as HTTP headers.",
  "sources": "Dictionary-like carriers accessed via get() and set() methods, primarily through default dictionary implementations.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; the code interacts with carriers via getter and setter interfaces, with no external or malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from carriers to Context objects during extraction and from Context to carriers during injection, using getter and setter methods respectively.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code consists solely of interface definitions and straightforward default implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard interface definitions for context propagation in telemetry SDKs, with default dictionary-based getter and setter implementations. It does not execute any logic beyond dictionary access and assignment. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is well-structured, clear, and typical for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and safe, serving as part of an open-source telemetry SDK. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
