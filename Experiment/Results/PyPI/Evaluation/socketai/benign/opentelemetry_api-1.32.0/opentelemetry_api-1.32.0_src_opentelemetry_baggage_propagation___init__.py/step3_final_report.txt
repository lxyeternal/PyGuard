  "purpose": "Implementation of a W3C baggage propagator for extracting and injecting baggage headers in OpenTelemetry context propagation.",
  "sources": "Carrier headers (specifically 'baggage') accessed via getter.get, input header string extracted from carrier.",
  "sinks": "set_baggage function updates the context with baggage entries; setter.set injects baggage header into carrier.",
  "flows": "Header retrieved from carrier -> split into entries -> validate and decode each entry -> update context with valid baggage -> format baggage string for injection.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected. Validation and length checks are standard. No suspicious behaviors or side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard extraction and injection of baggage headers with validation, length checks, and logging. It uses well-known libraries and functions, handles malformed entries gracefully, and maintains context integrity. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The overall design aligns with best practices for safe header propagation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented baggage propagator for OpenTelemetry, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score (~0.1) reflects normal operational warnings related to header size limits, not security issues.",
