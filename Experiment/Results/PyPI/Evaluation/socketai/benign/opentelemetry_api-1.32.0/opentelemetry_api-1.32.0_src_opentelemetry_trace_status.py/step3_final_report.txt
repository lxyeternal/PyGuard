  "purpose": "Provides status codes and a class to represent the status of a finished span, including validation and logging.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'status_code' and 'description' during Status object initialization.",
  "sinks": "Logging warnings for invalid description types or improper usage.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Validation checks -> Logging warnings -> Setting description if valid.",
  "anomalies": "Validation logic restricts 'description' to be set only when 'status_code' is ERROR; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enum for status codes and a class that encapsulates status with validation and logging. No external data sources, network activity, or obfuscation are present. Validation logic is standard, issuing warnings for improper types or usage. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The logging is used solely for warnings, not malicious purposes. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with best practices. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a status management component with proper validation and logging. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
