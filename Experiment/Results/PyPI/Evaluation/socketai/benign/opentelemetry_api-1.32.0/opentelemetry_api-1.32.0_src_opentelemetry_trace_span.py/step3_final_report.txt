  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions for managing distributed tracing context, including span, trace ID, span ID, trace state, and validation routines.",
  "sources": "Validation regex patterns, input parameters for trace keys, values, and trace context creation functions.",
  "sinks": "Validation functions, class methods for setting attributes, formatting functions for trace IDs and span IDs.",
  "flows": "Validation routines process input data; formatted IDs are used for trace context propagation; no external data or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code; regex validation is standard; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation of trace IDs, span IDs, and trace state headers, with regex patterns adhering to W3C specifications. No network, file, or external data handling is present. Warnings are used for validation failures, which is typical. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The code is a typical SDK component for distributed tracing, with thorough validation routines and clear structure. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of distributed tracing context management with no malicious activity or sabotage. Validation routines and formatting functions are appropriate and do not pose security threats. The overall security assessment is very high, with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
