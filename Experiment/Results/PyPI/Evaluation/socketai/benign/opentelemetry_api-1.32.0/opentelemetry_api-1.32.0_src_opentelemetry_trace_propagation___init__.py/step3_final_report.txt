  "purpose": "Manage and retrieve span objects within an OpenTelemetry context for distributed tracing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from optional 'context' parameters in functions; uses 'create_key' to generate a context key.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; the code only interacts with context objects internally.",
  "flows": "The span is set into the context via 'set_value' and retrieved via 'get_value' using the '_SPAN_KEY' key.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two functions for setting and getting a span in a context, using standard OpenTelemetry APIs. It handles optional parameters and type checks correctly, returning 'INVALID_SPAN' when no valid span is found. The implementation is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code aligns with best practices for context management in distributed tracing systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for managing span context in OpenTelemetry. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
