  "purpose": "Auto-generated test suite for listing Azure Automation accounts using Azure SDK.",
  "sources": "Azure SDK responses, resource group names from test utilities",
  "sinks": "API calls and response handling within controlled test environment",
  "flows": "API responses to assertions, resource group name inputs to SDK methods",
  "anomalies": "None observed; straightforward, auto-generated test code",
  "analysis": "The code performs resource listing tests with no external data manipulation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious logic. It uses standard libraries and testing patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1) are consistent with its benign, testing purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated test suite for Azure SDK resource listing operations. It exhibits no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
