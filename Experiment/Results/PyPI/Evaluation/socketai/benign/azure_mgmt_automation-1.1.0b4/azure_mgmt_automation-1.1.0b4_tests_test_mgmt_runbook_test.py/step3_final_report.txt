{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for managing Azure Automation accounts and runbooks, including fetching runbook content from a public GitHub URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads resource names, external URL for runbook content, and interacts with Azure SDK methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only retrieves content from a public URL and manages Azure resources.",
  "flows": "Resource creation functions (create_automation_account, create_runbook) call Azure SDK; get_content fetches runbook script from a public URL.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Azure SDK operations for resource management, with a static URL pointing to a public GitHub script. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious activity is evident. The URL is benign, and no secrets are hardcoded. The malware score is appropriately zero; obfuscation is absent. The security risk is minimal, justified by external URL usage but not problematic. Confidence in benignity is high.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign test suite for Azure automation resources, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
