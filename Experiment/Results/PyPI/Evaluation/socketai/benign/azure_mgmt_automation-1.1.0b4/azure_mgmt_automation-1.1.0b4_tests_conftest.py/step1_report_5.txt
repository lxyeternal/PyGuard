{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up test environment sanitizers to remove or mask sensitive data in recordings during automated tests.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET)",
  "sinks": "Sanitizer functions that mask sensitive data in logs or recordings, header and body sanitizers",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read as sources; sanitizers are applied to headers, body content, and regex patterns to prevent leakage in logs",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded default values for environment variables; sanitizers are applied to sensitive info but the approach is standard for testing, not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables, which may contain sensitive information. It then applies regex-based sanitizers to mask these variables and related headers in logs or recordings. This is a typical practice to prevent sensitive data exposure during testing. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code is present. The code does not perform any network communication, data theft, or system manipulation. The inclusion of hardcoded default values is a potential concern if used improperly, but within the context of test setup, it is benign. The code is straightforward and follows standard testing security precautions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for masking sensitive information during testing, with no indications of malicious intent or malware. The presence of default hardcoded values is typical in test environments but should be used carefully. Overall, the code is safe and intended solely for security hygiene during automated tests.",
