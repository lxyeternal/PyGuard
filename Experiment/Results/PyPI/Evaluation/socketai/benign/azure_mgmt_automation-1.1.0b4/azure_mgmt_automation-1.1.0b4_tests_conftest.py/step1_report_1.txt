{
  "purpose": "The code sets up environment variable loading and sanitization rules for test recordings to avoid leaking sensitive information such as credentials and tokens during testing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET)",
  "sinks": "Sanitization functions that replace sensitive data in test recordings, headers, and JSON response bodies",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read (sources) and then sanitized in test recordings via sanitizers (sinks)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets are used directly in code; sanitization uses environment variables which are typical for security. No suspicious or malicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules for environment loading and testing utilities. It loads environment variables, which are used to set sanitization rules for sensitive data, replacing potentially sensitive information with placeholders in test recordings. All actions follow standard security practices for test environment sanitization. No suspicious code, malicious behavior, or obfuscation is present. The code’s purpose is to prevent sensitive data leakage during testing, not to perform any harmful activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard environment variable sanitization for testing purposes and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly manages sensitive data in test recordings without exposing secrets.",
