{
  "purpose": "The code is used for setting up testing fixtures that sanitize sensitive information in test recordings to prevent leakage of secrets and identifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET) which may contain sensitive credentials.",
  "sinks": "Sanitizer functions that mask or replace sensitive data in recordings, and sanitizes HTTP headers and response body data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read as sources, and sanitizers are applied to mask these values and headers before data is stored or transmitted in test recordings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. Use of hardcoded placeholder secrets is common in testing contexts and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables containing sensitive credentials, then applies sanitizers to mask these values in test outputs, including headers and body content. The code appears to serve a security purpose in test data sanitization, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. The overall structure and functions are straightforward and typical for test setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is intended for sanitizing sensitive data during testing, not for malicious activities. It properly masks credentials and cookies in test recordings. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
