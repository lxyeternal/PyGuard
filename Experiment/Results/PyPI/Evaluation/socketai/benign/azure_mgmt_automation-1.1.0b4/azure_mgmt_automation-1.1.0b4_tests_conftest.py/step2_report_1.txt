  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's behavior, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code loads environment variables related to Azure credentials and applies sanitization functions to mask these secrets in test recordings.\n- It also sanitizes headers like \"Set-Cookie\" and \"Cookie\" and JSON fields such as \"$..access_token\".\n- All reports agree that the code's purpose is to prevent sensitive data leakage during testing.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is evident.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- The sanitization functions are standard for test environments.\n- No hardcoded secrets are present; defaults are placeholders.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are observed.\n\n### Errors or flaws:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a standard sanitization setup.\n- The only minor concern is the use of default placeholder environment variable values, which could be misused if not properly configured, but this is typical in test code.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal risk—appropriate given the code's purpose.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk above 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not introduce security vulnerabilities; it is a sanitization utility.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, as it's a test utility)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a straightforward, standard test setup script for sanitizing sensitive information.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks beyond normal test hygiene.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Score |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Risk           | 0.1             |\n\nThe low risk score reflects the minimal security concern, mainly because it handles sensitive data in a test environment, not in production or malicious context.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are accurate; the code is benign and standard for test sanitization.",
