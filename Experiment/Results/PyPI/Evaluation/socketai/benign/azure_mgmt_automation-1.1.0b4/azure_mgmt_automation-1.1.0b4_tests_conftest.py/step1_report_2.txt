  "purpose": "The code is a test setup script for managing environment variables and sanitizing sensitive information in test recordings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET)",
  "sinks": "Sanitizer functions that replace sensitive data in recordings; no data is transmitted or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read (sources) and then sanitized in test recordings via sanitizer functions (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Use of default placeholder values for sensitive environment variables; no hardcoded secrets or credentials in code.",
  "analysis": "The script loads environment variables and applies sanitizers to mask sensitive data in test recordings. No external data transmission, no malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to follow standard testing and sanitization practices, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing utility script used to sanitize sensitive environment variables and HTTP headers in test recordings. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks present.",
