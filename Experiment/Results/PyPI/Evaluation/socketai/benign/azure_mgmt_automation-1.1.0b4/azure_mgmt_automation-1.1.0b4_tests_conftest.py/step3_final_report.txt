  "purpose": "The code loads environment variables containing Azure credentials and applies sanitizers to mask these secrets, headers, and JSON fields during testing to prevent sensitive data leakage.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET), headers ('Set-Cookie', 'Cookie'), JSON path ('$..access_token')",
  "sinks": "Sanitization functions replacing sensitive data in test recordings, headers, and JSON bodies",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and passed to sanitization functions which mask their values in test outputs",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; use of default placeholder values is standard in test setups",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables for Azure credentials and applies regex sanitizers to mask these secrets, headers, and JSON fields during testing. It uses standard testing utilities and sanitization functions. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. The purpose is to prevent sensitive data leakage in test recordings. No obfuscation, network activity, or malicious behavior is observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, standard sanitization utility. The code is straightforward, with no anomalies or security issues. The overall assessment confirms the code's benign nature and appropriate scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign test sanitization script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are accurate and consistent with its purpose.",
