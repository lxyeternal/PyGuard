{
  "purpose": "This code configures sanitizers for sensitive information in test recordings, primarily to prevent exposure of secrets and identifiers during automated testing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables such as AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET; incoming HTTP headers and JSON response bodies.",
  "sinks": "Sanitizer functions that mask sensitive data in recordings, especially environment variables, headers, and JSON keys.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at the start; their values are sanitized in recordings; HTTP headers and JSON body fields containing sensitive info are sanitized during testing.",
  "anomalies": "The code reads environment variables containing sensitive credentials and applies regex-based sanitization, which is standard in test environments but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are found.",
  "analysis": "The script loads environment variables likely containing sensitive credentials. It uses these variables to set regex sanitizers to mask the values in test recordings. The sanitizers target common sensitive data such as subscription IDs, tenant IDs, client IDs, client secrets, cookies, and access tokens. All operations are related to test environment sanitization and do not execute any malicious or suspicious code. The use of dotenv, pytest, and sanitizers aligns with secure testing practices, and no malicious behaviors or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for sanitizing sensitive data during testing to prevent information leaks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security exploits. The focus is on masking secrets in logs and recordings, not on executing malicious actions.",
