  "purpose": "This script is used to configure the packaging and distribution of a Python Azure SDK library, specifically for 'azure-mgmt-automation'.",
  "sources": "File reads for 'version.py' or '_version.py', 'README.md', and 'CHANGELOG.md'. No untrusted input sources or network calls are present.",
  "sinks": "The script writes to setup configuration files and reads version info; no data leaks or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Read version info from local files -> parse and assign version -> configure package setup with static data; no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the code adheres to standard packaging practices. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static file reading to extract version information, then uses this information in setup configuration for packaging. All operations involve reading local files and defining package metadata, with no external data inputs, network activity, or malicious behavior. The license and author info is standard, and the code structure follows typical setup scripts. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It reads necessary files locally and configures package metadata safely.",
