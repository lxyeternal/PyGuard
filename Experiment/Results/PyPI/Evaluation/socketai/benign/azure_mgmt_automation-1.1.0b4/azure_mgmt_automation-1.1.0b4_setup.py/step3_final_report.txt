{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, reading version info from local files, and preparing package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from version.py or _version.py, and reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; all data is read from local files, with no network or external input involved.",
  "flows": "Reads local files -> processes data (regex extraction) -> passes data to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: reading version info via regex from local files, reading documentation files, and invoking setuptools.setup() with package metadata. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The regex used for version extraction is straightforward and safe. The code structure is typical for Python packaging scripts, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate.",
