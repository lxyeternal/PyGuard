  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the script as a setup configuration that reads version info, README, and CHANGELOG files. No issues here.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The setup() function is standard; no data leaks or malicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; this is a typical setup script with no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)  \n\n**Verdict:** No issues, scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; reads local files for version and documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flow or dynamic code execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; standard setup script, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing static file reads and standard setup procedures. No suspicious activity or anomalies noted.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same conclusion: straightforward setup script, no external inputs or malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Also consistent: reads local files, extracts version info with regex, no network or dynamic code execution.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Risk scores:** All are appropriately zero, given the code's benign nature.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly zero across all reports.\n- **Confidence:** High, as all reports agree and the code is straightforward.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Estimated scores:**  \n  - Malware: **0**  \n  - Obfuscated: **0**  \n  - Risk: **0**\n\n- **Justification:** The code is a standard setup script that reads local files for versioning and documentation, then invokes setuptools to package the library. No external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The process is typical for Python package distribution and poses no security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that. No further action needed.",
