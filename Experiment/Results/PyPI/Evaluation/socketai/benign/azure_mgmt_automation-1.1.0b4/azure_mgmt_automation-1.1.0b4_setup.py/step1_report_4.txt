  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package, specifically for the 'azure-mgmt-automation' SDK, used to package and distribute the library.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from local files, reading README.md and CHANGELOG.md files, and importing standard libraries.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes or transmits untrusted data, executes untrusted code, or interacts with network resources.",
  "flows": "The script reads local files to extract version info and documentation, then configures package setup parameters based on this data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The code strictly handles package setup and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks, including extracting version info from local files, reading documentation files, and configuring package metadata. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are involved beyond file reads, which are controlled. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic observed. The code aligns with common Python packaging practices and does not include malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It securely reads local files for package information and configures the package accordingly.",
