  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the details step-by-step.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly states that the code provides an interface for ssm-incidents, importing classes and functions from internal modules. No untrusted input handling is present.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows involving untrusted data are identified.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard wrapper, purely structural, with no dynamic or risky operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. — **Reasonable.**\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the absence of external input, data sinks, or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. — **Appropriate.**\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, the analysis confirms the code is a straightforward import/export module with no untrusted data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. — **Consistent.**\n\n**Report 4:**\n- The analysis notes the code sources from local modules, with no external or untrusted input, and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. — **Appropriate.**\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Recognizes the code as a simple import and export module, with documentation and no runtime data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. — **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking the Code and Reports:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is purely structural, importing classes and functions, defining aliases, and exporting them via `__all__`. There are no functions, no user input, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no data processing.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious code are present.\n- **Security Risks:** Since the code only re-exports classes and functions, and documentation is standard, the risk is minimal.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The **malware score** is correctly set to 0 across all reports, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- The **security risk score** is 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The only irregularity is the copyright year \"2025\" in the documentation, which is in the future relative to the knowledge cutoff (October 2023). This is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- All reports are accurate in their analysis.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's nature.",
