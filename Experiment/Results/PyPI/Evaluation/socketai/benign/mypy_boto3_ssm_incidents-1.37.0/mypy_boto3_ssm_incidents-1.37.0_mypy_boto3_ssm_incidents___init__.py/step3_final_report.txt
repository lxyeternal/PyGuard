{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the ssm-incidents service by importing and re-exporting SDK components.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter). No external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs involving untrusted data; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely structural with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the only irregularity is the future-dated copyright year '2025', which appears to be a typo or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, class aliasing, and documentation. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The structure is straightforward and typical for SDK wrapper modules. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content. The only minor concern is the copyright year, which does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature and assign appropriate scores. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
