{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface to the AWS SSM Incidents service, defining imports, class aliases, and module exports for interacting with the service via boto3.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter), and the inline documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks involving untrusted data handling, user input, or network communication are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow involving untrusted sources; mainly module setup and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The only notable element is the copyright date set in 2025, which is inconsistent with the 2023 knowledge cutoff but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, class aliasing, and module exports. It includes a docstring with usage examples and a link to documentation. There are no functions, data processing, or runtime data handling. No malicious or suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup for AWS SSM Incidents client with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not handle untrusted input nor perform any insecure operations. The only irregularity is the future-dated copyright year, which is benign.",
