{
  "purpose": "This module provides an interface for the ssm-incidents service, facilitating access to various paginators, waiters, and client classes for interacting with the service.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from imported modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter) and the inline documentation string. It does not handle untrusted input directly.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to security vulnerabilities, as the code primarily defines imports, class aliases, and exports.",
  "flows": "The code creates class aliases and re-exports imported components; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks or vice versa.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The documentation string includes example usage, but it is standard and contains no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes and functions from internal submodules and then exposes them via an alias and __all__ list. It includes only documentation and standard import statements, with no dynamic execution, user input handling, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. All code appears to be standard boilerplate for a Python SDK wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an interface for a service SDK. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious data handling, and no obfuscated or malicious code. It simply re-exports imported classes and functions for external use.",
