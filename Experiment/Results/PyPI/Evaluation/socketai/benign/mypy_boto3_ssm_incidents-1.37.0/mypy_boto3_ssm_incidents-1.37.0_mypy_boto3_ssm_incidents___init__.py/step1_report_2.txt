{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for the ssm-incidents service, importing client classes, paginators, and waiters for use in managing and interacting with AWS SSM Incidents.",
  "sources": "No external input sources, environment variables, or data reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output mechanisms that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code mainly imports and exposes classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and purely structural.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules related to the ssm-incidents AWS service and re-exports them via __all__ for external use. The comments and documentation provide usage examples but do not contain any executable code that processes untrusted input or performs risky operations. No environment variables, network calls, or data handling functions are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured API interface layer with no indicators of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard interface for AWS SDK components related to ssm-incidents, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly acts as an organizational layer for importing and exposing classes and constants.",
