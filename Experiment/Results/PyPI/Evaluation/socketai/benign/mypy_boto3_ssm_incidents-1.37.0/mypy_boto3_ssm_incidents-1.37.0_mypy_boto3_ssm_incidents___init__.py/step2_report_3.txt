  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is benign, only imports and re-exports, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** This is consistent. No issues detected. The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, no external input, no data handling, straightforward structure.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign and well-structured.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, a simple import/export module, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Slightly more detailed, mentions the potential for interaction with AWS services but no actual untrusted data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent. The code remains a benign wrapper.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as others, straightforward module, documentation, no runtime data processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural, importing and exporting classes/functions.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data handling that could be exploited.\n- The malware score is appropriately zero across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly zero, as there's no obfuscation.\n- The security risk is rightly zero, given the code's static nature and lack of data processing.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The only minor irregularity is the copyright year 2025 in the docstring, which is in the future relative to the knowledge cutoff, but this is benign and likely a typo or placeholder.\n- No report suggests any hidden or malicious intent.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign SDK interface module with no security issues. All scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
