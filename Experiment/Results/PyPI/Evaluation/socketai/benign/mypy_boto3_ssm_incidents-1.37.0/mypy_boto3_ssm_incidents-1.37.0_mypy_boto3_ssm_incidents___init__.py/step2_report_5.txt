  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is a simple module that imports classes and functions, then re-exports them. No dynamic code, user input, or network activity. No anomalies or obfuscation.  \n- **Assessment:** Completely benign, standard SDK wrapper code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; straightforward import and export of SDK components. No external input or data handling. No suspicious patterns.  \n- **Assessment:** Benign, standard structure.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; purely structural code, no processing of untrusted data, no network or dynamic execution.  \n- **Assessment:** Benign.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, a standard module organizing imports and exposing API components. No input handling, no network activity, no obfuscation.  \n- **Assessment:** Benign.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as others; purely import/export with documentation. The only irregularity is the copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future relative to current knowledge but is not malicious.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, no security risk.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or hidden payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the lack of any data handling, network activity, or dynamic execution, a risk score of 0 is justified across all reports.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The only minor irregularity is the copyright year 2025, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- The code's purpose is purely structural: importing classes/functions and exposing them, typical for SDK modules.\n\n### Final assessment:\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with this assessment, and the scoring aligns with the code's benign nature.",
