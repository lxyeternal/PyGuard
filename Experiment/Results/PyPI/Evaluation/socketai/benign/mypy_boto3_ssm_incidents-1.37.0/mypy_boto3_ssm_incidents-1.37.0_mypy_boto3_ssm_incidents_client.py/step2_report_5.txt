  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the validity of their claims, the correctness of their scoring, and whether any anomalies or malicious indicators are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that this code is a type-annotated SDK interface for AWS SSM Incidents, sourced from standard imports and local modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The code primarily unpacks kwargs into API calls, which is standard for SDK stubs. No untrusted data flows are evident.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code appears to be a well-structured, benign SDK interface.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that the code is benign with a high confidence level (0.9) and malware score of 0 is accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes this as a type annotation for an AWS SDK client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data manipulation or external communication; only method signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Standard SDK stub pattern, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly concludes the code is benign with high confidence (0.9) and malware score of 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, standard SDK stub definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows; mainly class and method signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Properly identified as benign with full confidence (1.0) and malware score of 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Recognizes this as a type-annotated SDK interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing; only method signatures with type hints.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly assesses benign nature with high confidence (0.9) and malware score of 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, standard SDK interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows that suggest malicious intent.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Properly concludes benign with full confidence (1.0) and malware score of 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify this as a type-annotated SDK client stub for AWS SSM Incidents.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports agree there is no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Security Risks:** The code is purely interface/definition code with no runtime logic or data processing that could pose security risks.\n- **Scores:** The assigned malware scores (0) and risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (negligible, as it is SDK interface code)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured, benign SDK stub for AWS SSM Incidents with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe and purely serves as a static type annotation interface for AWS SDK interactions.",
