  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the AWS SSM Incidents service, providing an interface for interacting with the service via boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class attributes; method definitions with parameters and return types.",
  "sinks": "Methods that perform actions such as retrieving or modifying resources, generating URLs, or managing incidents; especially the use of **kwargs unpacking that may include untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input via **kwargs passed to various methods (e.g., create, delete, update actions) flows into the API calls. No direct data flows to external systems are evident, but API calls are potential sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code structure is straightforward and conforms to typical boto3 client stub patterns. Use of extensive method signatures with type annotations is normal for SDK interfaces.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for AWS SSM Incidents with detailed type annotations, property methods, and overloads for paginators and waiters. The class methods mirror AWS API actions, using **kwargs for input parameters. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns are apparent. The presence of extensive type hints and API wrappers indicates a standard SDK interface implementation. No external network activity or sensitive data handling is directly visible. The code appears to be a well-structured, type-annotated SDK client stub for interfacing with AWS services.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign SDK interface implementation with detailed type annotations for the AWS SSM Incidents client. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured client stub code.",
