  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the AWS SSM Incidents service, enabling type-safe interactions with the API.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, standard library, botocore modules, local type_defs, paginator, waiter modules, and class method definitions including kwargs unpacking.",
  "sinks": "Methods accepting **kwargs unpacked from predefined type defs; no direct handling of untrusted data sources or output streams.",
  "flows": "Unpack of method kwargs (source) into API calls (sink), with no evidence of data manipulation or transmission beyond API request formation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'Unpack' in method signatures for kwargs; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no indication of malicious code such as network connections or system modifications; standard boilerplate for a boto3 client stub.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a boto3 client subclass with type annotations, property methods, and multiple method stubs for API operations, all with type hints referencing local type definitions. The use of 'Unpack' allows flexible kwargs passing aligned with predefined input types. There are no signs of obfuscated code, suspicious imports, or malicious logic. The purpose appears solely to enable type-checked API interactions. No signs of data exfiltration, system compromise, or malicious payloads are evident. All operations are standard API calls, with no malicious flows detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard type-annotated boto3 client stub implementation for AWS SSM Incidents. It contains no malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. It is designed to facilitate type-safe API calls with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
