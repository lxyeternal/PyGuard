{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the ssm-incidents service, used to facilitate type checking and IDE support for AWS SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class method parameters and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters (mostly kwargs), property accessors, and return statements; no direct data sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (kwargs) flow into client method calls, which would invoke AWS APIs; no untrusted data flows explicitly shown within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard SDK stub definitions with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious logic. The only notable aspect is extensive use of type annotations and overloads, which are standard for SDK stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class with methods corresponding to AWS SSM Incidents API operations. It includes type annotations, overloads for paginators and waiters, and properties for exceptions. No data manipulation, system commands, network connections, or other suspicious activities are present. The code mainly serves as a structured, type-annotated interface to AWS APIs. The license and comments do not indicate malicious intent. There is no evidence of code injection, backdoors, or harmful behavior. The code adheres to standard SDK stub design patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical SDK interface implementation for AWS services, providing type annotations and method signatures for API calls. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is very low.",
