  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and client class for AWS SSM Incidents, sourced from standard imports and local modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Input via **kwargs, which flow into API calls; no external data or untrusted sources evident.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; extensive type annotations are standard for SDK stubs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a well-structured, type-annotated SDK interface, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. It appears benign.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, reasonable given the detailed review.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on type annotations and API interface.\n- No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0.1 and 0, respectively, indicating negligible risk.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, consistent with the detailed reasoning.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Emphasizes static type annotations for the SDK.\n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, matching the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1, high due to clear, standard SDK stub patterns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Focuses on type annotations, method signatures, and overloads.\n- No malicious logic, data exfiltration, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, consistent with the thorough review.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar in scope—SDK interface with type annotations and documentation links.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, matching the benign assessment.\n- **Confidence:** 1, high due to the straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm that the code is a standard, well-structured SDK stub for AWS SSM Incidents.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is clear and typical for SDK type annotations.\n- **Risk scores:** All are appropriately low (0 or 0.1), reflecting negligible security risk.\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is transparent and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities evident beyond standard SDK use.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is a legitimate, non-malicious SDK interface for AWS SSM Incidents. There are no signs of supply chain compromise, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo further action needed. The code is safe and serves as intended for static type checking and SDK interaction.",
