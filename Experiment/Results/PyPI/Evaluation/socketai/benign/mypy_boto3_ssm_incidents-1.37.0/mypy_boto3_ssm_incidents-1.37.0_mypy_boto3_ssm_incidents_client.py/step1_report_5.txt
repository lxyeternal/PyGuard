  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for interacting with AWS SSM Incidents service, providing method signatures and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class and method definitions; property and method signatures.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no code executes untrusted input or performs insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code is mainly type definitions, method signatures, and property declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. The code appears to be standard SDK wrapper with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for AWS SSM Incidents with type annotations, method signatures, and overloads for paginators and waiters. No execution logic, data processing, or network activity is present. It primarily serves as a type-safe interface for AWS SDK. The presence of imports, class structure, and documentation links suggest it is a standard, well-structured SDK stub without malicious intent or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK type annotation and client class definition for AWS SSM Incidents. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It serves as a type-safe interface for the SDK, with no suspicious anomalies.",
