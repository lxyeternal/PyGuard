{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the boto3-stubs version of the SSMIncidents AWS SDK client, facilitating static type checking and autocompletion.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard library modules, third-party boto3 and botocore modules, and local type definitions and paginator/waiter classes. No user input or external data sources are accessed within the code itself.",
  "sinks": "None. The code consists mainly of class definitions and method signatures with no direct data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A. The code only defines the client interface and does not implement any data flows or logic beyond type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code strictly provides type annotations and class interfaces without any runtime logic that could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations, class definitions, and method signatures for the AWS SSM Incidents client, using type overloads for pagination and waiters. It imports necessary modules, defines exception types, and adheres to standard patterns for boto3 client stubs. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hidden code, or unsafe operations. The structure is consistent with a standard type stubs file intended for static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-malicious, well-structured set of type annotations for the AWS boto3 SSM Incidents client. It serves as a static type checking aid and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
