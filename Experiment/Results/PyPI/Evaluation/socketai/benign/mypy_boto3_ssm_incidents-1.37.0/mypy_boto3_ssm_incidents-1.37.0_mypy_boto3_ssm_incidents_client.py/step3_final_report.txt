  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for AWS SSM Incidents SDK, facilitating static type checking and API interaction.",
  "sources": "Method parameters via **kwargs, imported type definitions, and internal class properties.",
  "sinks": "API call methods that pass kwargs into AWS service requests; no external data flow or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Input kwargs flow into API request calls; no external data or untrusted sources processed directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured SDK stub with extensive type annotations, overloads, and documentation links. It serves as an interface for AWS SSM Incidents, with no runtime logic or external data handling that could indicate malicious activity. The absence of obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious patterns confirms its benign nature. The use of kwargs and type definitions aligns with standard SDK design, and no anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious SDK interface for AWS SSM Incidents. There are no signs of supply chain compromise, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with its benign, static nature.",
