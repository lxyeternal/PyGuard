  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations and waiter class definitions for ssm-incidents.\n- Sources: Import statements, class definitions, comments.\n- Sinks: No untrusted data processing.\n- Flows: No data flow, only class/method definitions.\n- Anomalies: None detected; code is straightforward.\n- Analysis: Standard subclassing of Waiter with type annotations; no malicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Benign, purely structural/type annotation code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Confidently safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to above, facilitating type-safe waiters.\n- Sources: Imports, class methods with **kwargs.\n- Sinks: No processing of untrusted data.\n- Flows: No data flow, just wrappers.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: Standard subclassing, conditional imports based on Python version.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign boilerplate code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Confident.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations and waiter class definitions.\n- Sources: Imports, class definitions.\n- Sinks: No untrusted data or I/O.\n- Flows: No data flow, mainly class definitions.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Boilerplate subclassing, no suspicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Standard SDK support code, safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Confident.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations and class extensions.\n- Sources: Imports, type_defs.\n- Sinks: No untrusted data or system interaction.\n- Flows: No data flow, only class/method definitions.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical pattern for type hints, no malicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Benign, safe code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Confident.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations and waiters for boto3.\n- Sources: Modules, class definitions, comments.\n- Sinks: No data manipulation.\n- Flows: No data flow, just class structures.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard subclassing, no runtime data processing.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard SDK boilerplate.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Confident.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None. All reports clearly describe static class definitions, type annotations, and documentation links. No network activity, data processing, or suspicious code is present.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward, with clear class structures and conditional imports.\n- **Malware score:** Zero across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk score:** Zero, as the code is purely for type annotations and SDK support, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports seem appropriate and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed; the code is safe and standard boilerplate for boto3 type annotations.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the absence of any suspicious or malicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports accurately identify the code as benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.",
