  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from boto3's Waiter, with type annotations and documentation links.\n- No data processing, external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code appears to be boilerplate or autogenerated SDK support code.\n- All reports conclude the code is benign, with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Observations:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of issues like hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or data leaks.\n   - The class structures and methods are standard and do not process untrusted data.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely structural/type annotations, with no malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Malware and Risk Justification:**\n   - The code contains no malware, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The highest risk scores (close to 1) are unjustified; all evidence points to zero risk.\n   - The code is purely for type annotations and class inheritance, typical for SDK stubs.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly identify the code as non-malicious.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No anomalies or inconsistencies are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious patterns)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Estimated scores** based on the detailed review should be:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is standard, safe, and purely for type annotations and class definitions related to boto3 waiters. All reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nKeep the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at **0**. The code is benign with no security concerns.",
