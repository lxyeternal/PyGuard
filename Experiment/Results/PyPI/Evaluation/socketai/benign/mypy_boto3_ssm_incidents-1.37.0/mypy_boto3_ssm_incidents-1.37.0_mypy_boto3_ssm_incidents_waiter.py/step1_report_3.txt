  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for waiters in the ssm-incidents service client for boto3.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources; only imports and class/method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; wait methods are overridden but contain no logic or data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; methods are placeholders calling super().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code is purely for type annotations and class structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two waiter classes inheriting from boto3's Waiter, with overridden wait methods that accept specific parameters. It includes type annotations, conditional import logic based on Python version, and documentation links. No input/output handling or dynamic code execution is present. The code appears to be standard, autogenerated or boilerplate code for SDK support with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard SDK boilerplate for type annotations and waiter class definitions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and purely for type hinting and documentation purposes.",
