  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is purely for type annotations and class definitions.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None identified. The report correctly notes the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification for risk/malware scores?** None needed; the code is safe.\n- **Overall:** The report is accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is straightforward, defining subclasses with typed wait() methods.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. The reasoning aligns with the code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is boilerplate for SDK support.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. The analysis is accurate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Justified.\n- **Overall:** Valid and sound.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is a standard type annotation setup.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is purely for type annotations and class structure.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. The analysis is thorough.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Reasonable.\n- **Overall:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores are 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores are 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is purely structural, type annotations, and documentation, the risk score should be minimal or zero.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The entire set of reports is consistent, accurate, and the code in question is safe. No modifications to scores or assessments are necessary.",
