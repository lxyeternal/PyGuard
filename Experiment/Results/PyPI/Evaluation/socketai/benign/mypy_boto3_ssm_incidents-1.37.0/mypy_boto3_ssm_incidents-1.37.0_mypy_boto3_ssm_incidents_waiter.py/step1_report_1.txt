{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and waiter class definitions for the ssm-incidents service client in boto3, intended to facilitate type checking and provide documentation links.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method signatures, and comments/documentation URLs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user input, or external data processing points are present. No data leaks or unsafe operations are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and methods for a boto3 client.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and primarily consists of class definitions, method signatures, and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and waiter class wrappers for boto3 ssm-incidents client. It imports necessary modules, defines two classes inheriting from botocore.waiter.Waiter, and specifies wait methods with type annotations using Unpack for argument flexibility. The comments include documentation links but do not execute or process data. No code manipulates external data, performs network operations, or includes any suspicious logic. All imports and class structures are standard and documented. No potential security risks or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for type annotations and class structure related to boto3 waiters. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It is a standard, safe code module with no indications of malware or security concerns.",
