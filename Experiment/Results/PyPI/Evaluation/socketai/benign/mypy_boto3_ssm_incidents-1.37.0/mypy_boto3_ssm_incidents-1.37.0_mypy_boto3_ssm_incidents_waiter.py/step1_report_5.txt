{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and waiters for the ssm-incidents service client in boto3, providing structured wait functionality with type hints.",
  "sources": "Reading imported modules, class definitions, method signatures, and comments.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes to or manipulates untrusted data or system resources directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily defines classes and methods with type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected. No network, file, or system command operations present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two subclasses of Waiter with overridden wait methods, includes imports with version checks, and contains detailed documentation comments. No external data is read at runtime, no dynamic code execution, no system modifications, nor network activities are present. The purpose appears solely to provide typed waiters for AWS SDK interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a type-annotated interface for AWS waiters with no malicious intent. It follows standard patterns, and no security issues are detected.",
