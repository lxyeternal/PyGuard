{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and waiter class definitions for the ssm-incidents service client, facilitating type-safe waiting for specific resource states in boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs; class methods using **kwargs for waiters.",
  "sinks": "The wait() methods accept arbitrary keyword arguments unpacked as specific type defs, but do not process or transmit untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; wait() methods are merely wrappers around AWS SDK waiters with typed parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The code is straightforward and purely structural/type annotation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses of Waiter with typed wait() methods, importing standard modules, and conditional typing imports based on Python version. No external input handling or network activity is present. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign set of type annotations and class definitions for AWS waiters, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
