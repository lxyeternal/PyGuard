  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for waiters in the ssm-incidents service client for boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and type definitions from .type_defs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; no network, file, or environment variable operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily defines classes and methods with no data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is a straightforward type annotation and class extension setup.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type annotations for waiters in the boto3 ssm-incidents client, defining two classes that inherit from Waiter. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard practice. No input/output operations, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. No signs of malicious code, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The module appears to be a well-structured type definition file for SDK enhancement, with no suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for type annotations and class inheritance, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign, standard setup for boto3 stubs with no indicators of malware or security issues.",
