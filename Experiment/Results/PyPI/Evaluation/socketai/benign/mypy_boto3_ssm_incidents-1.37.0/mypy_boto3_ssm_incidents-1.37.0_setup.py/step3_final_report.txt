  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Local README.md file for long description, static package metadata fields, imported modules (pathlib.Path, setuptools.setup).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network calls, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md into LONG_DESCRIPTION, static data passed directly to setup() without processing or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and follows typical packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script with static metadata, no dynamic or malicious behavior. It reads a local file for description and calls setup() with fixed parameters. No obfuscated code, secrets, or network activity are present. All signals indicate benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The reports are accurate and correctly assess the code as safe. No modifications or escalations are necessary.",
