{
  "purpose": "This script is used to configure and package a Python library called mypy-boto3-ssm-incidents for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The script reads the content of README.md for the long_description.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data; no output or external data processing that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The only flow involves reading a file (README.md) and passing static data to the setup() function; no external input is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior. The license and author info are standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries, reads a markdown file for description, and configures the package setup with static, hardcoded metadata. It uses a typical setup() call with no untrusted input, dynamic code execution, or external network activity. No secrets or credentials are embedded. The code is clean, well-structured, and typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks. It appears to be a benign, legitimate package configuration.",
