  "purpose": "Setup script for publishing the mypy-boto3-ssm-incidents package, providing package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; importing setup from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only uses static data and file reading.",
  "flows": "N/A - no dynamic data flow; static configuration data is used for setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the script follows standard setup.py structure. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path and setup, reads the README.md for a long description, and calls setup() with static package metadata including name, version, author info, classifiers, keywords, URLs, and dependencies. All data appears to be static and intended for package distribution. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic execution that could be malicious is present. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign, typical setup configuration for a Python package.",
