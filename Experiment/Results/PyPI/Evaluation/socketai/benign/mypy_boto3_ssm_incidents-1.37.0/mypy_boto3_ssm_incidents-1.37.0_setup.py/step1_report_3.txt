{
  "purpose": "This setup script is intended to configure the packaging and installation parameters for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-ssm-incidents'.",
  "sources": "Reads the script file itself for the copyright comment and the 'README.md' file for long description; uses setuptools.setup() to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No typical data sinks for untrusted input; no network, file, or system command executions present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow paths involving untrusted data; data primarily sourced from local files and package configuration inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; standard setup script structure.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'Path' from 'pathlib' and 'setup' from 'setuptools', then reads the README.md for long description content. The setup() function is called with static package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, and no suspicious patterns detected. The copyright notice is a static comment, and all other data are hardcoded or derived from local files. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to define package configuration and metadata. No suspicious anomalies or malicious intents are identified.",
