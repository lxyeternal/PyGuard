  "flows": "N/A - static assignment without external data input.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future copyright date (2025) which is inconsistent with the current year; no malicious code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, which is a common practice for Python packages. The only potential anomaly is the copyright year set to 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date, but this does not indicate malicious intent. The code is simple, static, and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, no external data sources, or complex flows. No obfuscation or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration with a minor anomaly in the copyright year. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks present.",
