  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and overall security implications.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll reports describe a minimal, static version assignment in a Python module, with no dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. The only noted anomaly is a future copyright year (2025), which is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Code Content:** The code is simply:\n  ```python\n  \"\"\"\n  Source of truth for version.\n\n  Copyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n  \"\"\"\n\n  __version__ = \"1.37.0\"\n  ```\n  No input handling, no external communication, no obfuscation, no malware, and no suspicious constructs.\n\n- **Malware and Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify no malware or obfuscation.\n\n- **Security Risks:** No evidence of security risks, given the static, benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Issue Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the benign static assignment.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.9 with justification, but since the code is harmless, a score of 0 is appropriate. The one report with 0.9 seems to overstate risk due to the future copyright year, which is not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Each Report:\n\n1. **Report 1:**\n   - **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious behavior.\n   - **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.\n   - **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n2. **Report 2:**\n   - **Notes:** Mentions the future copyright year.\n   - **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0 — correct.\n   - **Confidence:** 0.9 — acceptable; minor anomaly but not risky.\n\n3. **Report 3:**\n   - **Conclusion:** Benign, straightforward.\n   - **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.\n   - **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n4. **Report 4:**\n   - **Analysis:** Same as above.\n   - **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0 — correct.\n   - **Confidence:** 1.\n\n5. **Report 5:**\n   - **Analysis:** Similar, no issues.\n   - **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.\n   - **Confidence:** 1.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The **malware scores** are correct across all reports.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are correct.\n- The **risk scores** should all be **0**, as there is no security risk, malicious activity, or obfuscation. The minor anomaly (future copyright year) does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a simple, static version declaration with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores should be uniformly **malware: 0**, **obfuscated: 0**, **risk: 0**. The only minor note is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern.\n\nPlease proceed with these adjusted scores for consistency.",
