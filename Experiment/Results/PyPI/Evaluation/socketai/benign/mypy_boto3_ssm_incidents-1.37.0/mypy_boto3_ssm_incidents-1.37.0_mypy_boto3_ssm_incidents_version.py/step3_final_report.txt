  "purpose": "Defines a static version string for the package, serving as a version identifier.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns a static string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is benign and likely a typo.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module assigning a static version string. It contains no dynamic code, input/output, external data handling, or obfuscation. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving solely as a version identifier. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks present. The minor anomaly in the copyright year does not influence security assessment.",
