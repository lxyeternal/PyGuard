  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the correctness of their conclusions, the consistency of their scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe a minimal, static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No external data handling, dynamic code, or complex logic is present.\n- The code is straightforward, with only a copyright comment and a version assignment.\n- The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is benign but slightly unusual.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Issue Presence\n\n- **Issue presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a static version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct given the code's simplicity.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes in the reports\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- They correctly identify the absence of dynamic behavior, external data flows, or obfuscation.\n- The only potential concern is the future copyright year (2025), but this is not a security issue; it's an anomaly worth noting but not a risk.\n\n---\n\n### Score evaluations and reasoning\n\n- **Confidence scores:** Mostly 1 or 0.9, reflecting high certainty that the code is benign.\n- **Anomalies:** The only anomaly is the future year, which the reports mention but do not consider a security concern.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Suggestion:** The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** None of the reports make unwarranted assumptions. They do not speculate beyond the evidence.\n- **Malware or malicious intent:** None detected or suspected; scores are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** Correctly identified as absent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment\n\nGiven the code's simplicity and the reports' correctness, I agree with the assigned scores.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe only minor note is the future copyright year, which could be flagged as a minor anomaly, but it does not affect security.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe and does not pose any security concerns.",
