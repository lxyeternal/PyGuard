  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leak or effect.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from external sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward version declaration with a copyright statement.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a copyright notice and sets a version string. It does not perform any input/output operations, data processing, or system interactions. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code features are present. The structure and content are typical for a version module in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
