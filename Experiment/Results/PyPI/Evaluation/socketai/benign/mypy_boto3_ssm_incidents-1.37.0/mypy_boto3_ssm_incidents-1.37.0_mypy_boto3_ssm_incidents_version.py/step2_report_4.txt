  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No external data handling, dynamic code, or data flows are present.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The only minor anomaly noted is the future copyright year (2025), which is not a security concern.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The first report correctly states that the code is benign, with a confidence of 1, and assigns a malware score of 0.\n- The second report notes the future copyright year but appropriately concludes no malicious intent.\n- The third, fourth, and fifth reports similarly identify the code as straightforward and safe.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is accurate.\n- The security risk score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only point of contention might be the future copyright year (2025). While this is an anomaly, it doesn't impact security.\n- No reports suggest any code that could be malicious or obfuscated.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n- The code is a minimal, static version declaration with no security risks.\n- The malware score should remain 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain 0.\n- The overall security risk should stay at 0.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no security issues or malicious behavior. The only minor anomaly (future copyright year) does not affect security.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Confirmed no issues in the code.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The report accurately reflects the benign nature of this version declaration.",
