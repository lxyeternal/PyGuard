  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential security issues, malware, obfuscation, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes the code as type annotations and paginator class definitions for the ssm-incidents service, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, serving as a stub for type safety, with no signs of external data processing or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** Fully aligned with the code's nature. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing type annotations, class structures, and no malicious behavior. Slightly higher securityRisk (0.1) possibly due to the mention of documentation URLs and license comments.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious code, no external data handling, just type stub definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — **reasonable**.\n- **Justification for securityRisk:** The minimal risk is acceptable given the nature of the code; no actual security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing safe, standard class definitions and type annotations.\n- **Scores:** All zero except securityRisk=0, which is appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious elements detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard type annotations, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** All zero, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with confidence slightly below 1 (0.9), but still consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** All zero, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. The code is purely for type annotations and class definitions; no network activity, code execution, or malicious patterns are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports. The code is clear, standard, and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0 or very minimal (0.1), justified by the fact that the code doesn't process untrusted data or perform any operations beyond type annotations.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code's nature. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is detected. The minimal security risk score in one report is justified by the documentation and licensing comments, not by any actual security concern.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe type stub for boto3 paginators, with no security or malicious issues.",
