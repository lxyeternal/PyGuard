{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the ssm-incidents service client, facilitating typed access to paginated responses from AWS API calls.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class methods that call client.get_paginator and its paginate method.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods invoke client.get_paginator, which may access AWS services; however, no untrusted input is processed directly within these methods.",
  "flows": "The code defines classes extending Paginator, with paginate methods that unpack input parameters and return PageIterator objects; no data flows directly from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. All code appears to be standard type annotations and class definitions for a boto3 paginator interface.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and class structures for AWS boto3 paginators, with conditional imports based on Python version, and uses TYPE_CHECKING to optimize type hints. It extends Paginator classes with paginate methods that accept specific typed inputs and return typed PageIterator outputs. No external data, network calls, or untrusted inputs are processed directly within these class methods. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured typing stub for AWS boto3 paginator interfaces.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type stub implementation for boto3 ssm-incidents paginators, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves as an interface for typing support, without executing any untrusted or harmful code.",
