  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginator classes for the ssm-incidents service client in boto3, facilitating type-checked pagination over various API endpoints.",
  "sources": "Code reads static type definitions from 'type_defs', imports from botocore.paginate, and system modules. No user input or external data sources are accessed.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data writing, network communication, or sensitive data handling. It mainly defines classes and methods for pagination.",
  "flows": "The paginator classes define 'paginate' methods that accept arbitrary keyword arguments unpacked into type definitions, returning page iterators for paginated responses. No untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard type annotation and class definitions for boto3 paginators. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present. No suspicious dynamic code execution or backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type definitions for boto3 paginators related to the ssm-incidents service. It conditionally imports 'Unpack' for Python >= 3.12, defines several paginator classes inheriting from generic Paginator with appropriate type annotations, and implements 'paginate' methods that simply pass through keyword arguments. There are no indications of malicious behavior, network activity, or security issues. The code is consistent with standard type stubs for boto3. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of type annotations and paginator class definitions for boto3, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to facilitate type-checked pagination in the boto3 ssm-incidents client.",
