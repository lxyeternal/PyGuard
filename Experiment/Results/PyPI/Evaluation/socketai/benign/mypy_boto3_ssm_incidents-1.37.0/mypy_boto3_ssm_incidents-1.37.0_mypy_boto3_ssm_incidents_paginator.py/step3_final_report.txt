  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for boto3 ssm-incidents paginators, serving as interface stubs for type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Methods invoking 'client.get_paginator' with parameters; class constructors; type definition imports.",
  "sinks": "No external data processing, network calls, or untrusted input handling within this code.",
  "flows": "The 'paginate' methods accept parameters and return PageIterator objects; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns; standard structure for type stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of type annotations and class definitions for boto3 paginators, with no external data handling or malicious behavior. Documentation links and type definitions are used appropriately. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0 or 0.1) accurately reflect the benign, interface-only nature of the code. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious type stub for AWS boto3 paginators. All reports correctly identify its safe, structural purpose. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are appropriate and justified.",
