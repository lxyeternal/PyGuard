  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for ssm-incidents service client, providing structured access to paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class methods that call 'paginate' with **kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods accept **kwargs, which are unpacked and passed to Paginator objects. No external or untrusted data sources identified.",
  "flows": "Sources (input parameters in 'paginate' methods) flow into paginator classes and are used in API calls within the 'paginate' methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. All code appears to be standard boto3-stubs class definitions and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for various ssm-incidents API operations, extending generic Paginator classes with specific type annotations. The 'paginate' methods are designed to accept keyword arguments matching the respective input types and return PageIterator objects for output types. The structure adheres to standard boto3-stubs patterns. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are handled unsafely. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected. The code appears to be a well-structured type annotation layer for boto3 paginators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of paginator class definitions with appropriate type annotations for AWS ssm-incidents. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks identified. It is safe and intended for type checking and IDE support.",
