{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for ssm-incidents service client, providing type-safe pagination methods for AWS SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore.paginate, type definitions from .type_defs, and class methods that accept **kwargs for pagination parameters.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data; the code defines interfaces and classes for pagination without executing or processing external data directly.",
  "flows": "The paginate methods accept pagination parameters via **kwargs, but do not process or send data to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. All code appears to be standard type annotation and pagination class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for AWS paginator wrappers, with type annotations, conditional import handling, and minimal logic—mainly method signatures. No data processing, network communication, or external data handling is present. The code is straightforward, aimed at providing type safety and documentation links. No obfuscated or malicious code is detected. Overall, this appears to be a legitimate SDK typing enhancement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type annotations module for AWS SDK paginators with no malicious intent or security risks. It strictly provides interface definitions and does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
