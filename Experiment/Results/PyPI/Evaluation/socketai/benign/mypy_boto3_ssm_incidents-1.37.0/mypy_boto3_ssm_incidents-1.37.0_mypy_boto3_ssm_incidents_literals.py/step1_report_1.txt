  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS SDK literal values used in boto3-stubs for the ssm-incidents service.",
  "sources": "Constant string literals assigned to variables for type annotations, imported modules, and version check for typing import.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; the code only establishes type literals and conditional imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and purely definitional.",
  "analysis": "The script defines various Literal types for use in type annotations, adapting to Python version differences for importing 'Literal'. It imports standard modules, declares constants with string literals, and exports them. The code is purely declarative, with no input/output or side effects. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type definitions module for AWS boto3-stubs, with no signs of malicious intent or security threats. It is a benign, purely informational, and structural component.",
