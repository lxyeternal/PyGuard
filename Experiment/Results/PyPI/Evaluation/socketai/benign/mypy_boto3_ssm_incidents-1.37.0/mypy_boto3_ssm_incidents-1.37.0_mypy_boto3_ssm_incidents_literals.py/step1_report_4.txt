  "purpose": "Define type annotations for literals used in boto3 ssm-incidents service to improve code correctness and autocompletion.",
  "sources": "Literal string definitions for various AWS resource names, statuses, and paginator/waiter names; import statements for Python version compatibility.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type annotations via Literal definitions for various AWS resources and statuses used in boto3. It imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version. All defined constants are static string literals, used for type safety. No input/output, no dynamic execution, no credential handling, nor network communication present. The code is purely declarative with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type definition module for boto3 literals, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves as a helper module for type safety and code assistance.",
