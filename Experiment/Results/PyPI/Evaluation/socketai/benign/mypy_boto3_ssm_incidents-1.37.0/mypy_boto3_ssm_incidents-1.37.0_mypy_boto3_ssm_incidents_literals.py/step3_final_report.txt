  "purpose": "Define static type annotations for AWS SDK literals used in boto3-stubs for ssm-incidents, including resource names, statuses, paginator names, and other constants.",
  "sources": "Static string literals and conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, output, or dynamic code execution; purely static definitions.",
  "flows": "The code provides type aliases for literals, used for type safety and IDE support; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.version_info for conditional import is standard; no suspicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using Literal, with a compatibility check for Python versions >= 3.12. It contains no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or malicious patterns. The purpose is to improve type safety and documentation for AWS SDK resource identifiers and statuses. All findings indicate a benign, declarative module with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static set of type annotations for AWS SDK literals, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are all 0, consistent with its static, declarative nature.",
