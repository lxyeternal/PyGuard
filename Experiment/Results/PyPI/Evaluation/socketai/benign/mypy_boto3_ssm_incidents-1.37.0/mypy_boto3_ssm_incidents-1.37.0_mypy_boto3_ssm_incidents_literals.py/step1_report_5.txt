{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various literals used in the ssm-incidents service, primarily for type safety and clarity in code using boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Constant string literals assigned to variables for use as type annotations; imported modules sys and typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows detected; the code primarily declares constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "No flow from source to sink identified; code is static and does not process external input or data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. The code is straightforward type definition with version-dependent import handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version-based conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It then defines multiple Literal type aliases for various resource names, statuses, and other constants used within the boto3 ssm-incidents module. All literals are static strings, with no dynamic or user input processing. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs, no code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for type annotation purposes, enhancing code safety and developer clarity. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign static declaration file with no indications of sabotage or security threats.",
