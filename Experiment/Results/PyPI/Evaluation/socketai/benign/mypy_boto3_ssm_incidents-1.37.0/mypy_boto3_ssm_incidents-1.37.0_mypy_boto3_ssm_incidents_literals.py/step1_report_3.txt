{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS SDK resource identifiers, paginator names, and status types for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions, and variable assignments of Literal types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static type definitions do not process external input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to dangerous sinks; the code strictly defines type literals.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.version_info for conditional import, but this is a common pattern for compatibility. No suspicious code or obfuscated patterns. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions using Literal, intended for type safety and code clarity. The conditional import ensures compatibility across Python versions. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or network interactions are present. All variables are simple type aliases with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines static type annotations for AWS resource identifiers and related literals. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code appears to be a benign, well-structured type definition module.",
