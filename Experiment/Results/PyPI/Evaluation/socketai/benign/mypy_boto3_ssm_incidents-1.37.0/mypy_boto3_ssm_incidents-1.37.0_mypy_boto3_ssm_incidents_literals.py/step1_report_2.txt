{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS SSM Incidents service literals and related string literals for improved type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "String literals assigned to variables such as GetResourcePoliciesPaginatorName, IncidentRecordStatusType, ServiceName, etc.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs identified; code primarily defines constants and type annotations.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions without dynamic data flow or untrusted input/output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, and no obfuscated code. Usage of conditional import for typing extension is standard. All literals are documented and used for type safety.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static type annotations using Python's Literal types to define constants for AWS SDK parameters, regions, service names, and other enumerations. The conditional import for Literal ensures compatibility with different Python versions. No external data sources, no code execution, no dynamic behavior, and no signs of malicious intent. It appears to be a straightforward, well-structured module for type annotations, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, aimed at improving code correctness and readability through type annotations. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks within this code fragment.",
