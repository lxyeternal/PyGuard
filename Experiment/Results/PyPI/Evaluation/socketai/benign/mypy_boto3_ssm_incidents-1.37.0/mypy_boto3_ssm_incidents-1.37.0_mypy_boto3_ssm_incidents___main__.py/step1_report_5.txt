  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs package information and version details. It only reads command-line arguments and writes static information to stdout. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code activities. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed beyond basic argument checking. The code structure is simple, clean, and intended solely for informational output.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a CLI utility for package info and version display. No malicious intent, no security risks detected.",
