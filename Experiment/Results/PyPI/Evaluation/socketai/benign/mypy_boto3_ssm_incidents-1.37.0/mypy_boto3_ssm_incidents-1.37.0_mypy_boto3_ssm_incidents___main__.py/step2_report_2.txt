  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the review reports carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code Review and Logical Analysis:**\n\n- The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details.\n- It reads command-line arguments via `sys.argv`.\n- It outputs data via `sys.stdout.write()`.\n- The only argument it checks for is `--version`.\n- The functions `print_info()` and `print_version()` output static, hardcoded strings.\n- There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no user input processing beyond argument checking.\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, intended solely for informational purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Reports:**\n\n- All five reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious activity.\n- They consistently note the absence of suspicious code, external data fetching, or obfuscation.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n- The malware scores are all 0, aligning with the assessment that there is no malicious intent.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**3. Scoring Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is correct; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 is appropriate; the code poses no security threat.\n\n**4. Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n\n- No discrepancies are apparent.\n- The code and reports are consistent.\n- The reports do not overstate the security implications; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n**5. Final Assessment and Recommendations:**\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n- The code is a simple CLI utility with static outputs.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code and reports are aligned. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that. No further action or adjustment is necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** The reports are thorough and accurate. The code is a benign utility with no security concerns.",
