  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It imports only `sys`, uses straightforward functions, and runs only if executed directly.\n   - There are no external data sources, network calls, dynamic code execution, or user inputs beyond argument checking.\n   - The output is static and informational.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious imports.\n   - No signs of data exfiltration, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is very simple and serves a benign purpose.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All five reports consistently describe the code as benign, straightforward, and without security concerns.\n   - They correctly identify the code's purpose as informational CLI output.\n   - They note the absence of anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious intent.\n   - The confidence levels are all at 1, which aligns with the code's simplicity and transparency.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, justified by the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Reconsiderations:**\n   - The code is very simple and static; no dynamic or risky behaviors are present.\n   - The reports are accurate; no changes needed.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a benign CLI utility with no security issues.\n   - The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n   - No further action or adjustment is necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code poses no security threat, and the reports accurately reflect this. The overall security assessment remains very low risk.",
