  "purpose": "Provides CLI commands to display package information and version for boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout (outputs info)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (writes package info and version)",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (source) -> print_version or print_info (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. The code simply prints static information.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and only outputs static package information or version based on command-line arguments. It uses sys.argv for input and sys.stdout for output, both standard Python modules. No untrusted input processing, no data exfiltration, network activity, or suspicious dynamic code execution is present. The code performs basic CLI functions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed solely for displaying package info and version. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
