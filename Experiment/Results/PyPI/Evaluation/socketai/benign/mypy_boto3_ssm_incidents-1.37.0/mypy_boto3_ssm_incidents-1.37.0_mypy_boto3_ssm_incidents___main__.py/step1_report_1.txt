  "purpose": "CLI entry point for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "targets": "Outputs information to stdout via sys.stdout.write().",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, calls print_version() -> outputs version string; otherwise, calls print_info() -> outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No external data sources or untrusted inputs involved. The code is straightforward and mainly for informational purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and defines three functions: print_info(), print_version(), and main(). print_info() outputs package-related metadata; print_version() outputs the version string. main() checks for '--version' argument and calls the appropriate function, defaulting to print_info(). The script then runs main() if executed directly. There are no indications of data exfiltration, malicious code, or obfuscation. The only inputs are command-line arguments, which are handled securely. The output is purely informational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying package information and version. No malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks detected.",
