  "purpose": "Display static package information and version details via CLI.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "stdout via sys.stdout.write() for output",
  "flows": "Argument check in main() -> print_version() or print_info() -> stdout",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static strings, no dynamic code or external data",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments. It imports only sys, checks for '--version' argument, and prints predefined strings. No external data sources, network activity, or untrusted input processing is present. The code is straightforward, with functions dedicated to outputting static information. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. The logic is clear, and the code serves an informational purpose only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as an informational CLI utility. The existing assessment scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0—are accurate and justified.",
