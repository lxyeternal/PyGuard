  "purpose": "CLI entrypoint script for displaying package information and version.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write() outputs data; sys.argv reads input data.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, calls print_version() then outputs '1.37.0'; otherwise, calls print_info() to output package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI tool that displays static information about a package. It reads command-line arguments to determine whether to output version info or package details. All data outputs are static strings. There are no external data sources, network calls, or user inputs that could be exploited. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, intended solely for providing package information via CLI. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
