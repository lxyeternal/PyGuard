  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code only contains type definitions and data structures for the ssm-incidents SDK. No external input handling, no executable logic, no data flows involving untrusted sources. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that this is a benign type annotations module. The code is standard for SDK type definitions, with no runtime logic or external interactions.\n\n- **Security implication:** No malware, no security risk. The confidence is high (1), and the analysis is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is solely for static type checking, with no external data handling or executable logic. No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report accurately describes the nature of the code. It confirms that the code is purely for type annotations and documentation, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Security implication:** No malware or security risk. The confidence is high (1).\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a collection of type definitions and data structures, with standard imports and no runtime logic. No external data processing, no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes that the code is for static type safety, with no executable or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Security implication:** No malware, no security concern. Confidence is high (1).\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is primarily static type definitions, with no runtime logic or external data handling. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The review correctly concludes that this is a standard type declaration module, serving only for static analysis and documentation.\n\n- **Security implication:** No malware or security risk. Confidence is high (1).\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code contains type annotations and data schemas, with no executable code or external data processing. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report accurately describes the code as a standard type declaration library, with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Security implication:** No malware, no security concern. Confidence is high (1).\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports agree that the code only defines data structures and type annotations, with no executable logic, external data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Malware / Obfuscated / Security risk scores:**\n\n  - **Malware:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n  \n  - **Security risk:** 0, as there are no signs of vulnerabilities, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores justification:** Given the detailed descriptions and the actual code content, these scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — purely static type definitions, no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The entire set of reports correctly identifies that this code is a benign, standard type definition module for an SDK, with no malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a further detailed review or specific focus on any part.",
