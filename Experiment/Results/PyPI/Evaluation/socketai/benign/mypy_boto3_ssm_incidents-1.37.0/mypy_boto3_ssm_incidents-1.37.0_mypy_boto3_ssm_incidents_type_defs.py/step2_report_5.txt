  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of type definitions, TypedDict classes, type aliases, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n   - No executable logic, data processing, network calls, or external interactions are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are observed.\n   - The code is purely declarative, serving as a schema for static type checking.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is standard for SDK type definitions and contains no executable or runtime logic.\n   - No inaccuracies or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning of the reports.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Given the code's nature, this is appropriate.\n   - No adjustments are necessary for the scores; they are consistent with the findings.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely type annotations and data schemas with no runtime or executable components, the risk of malicious activity is effectively zero.\n   - The malware score is also zero because there's no evidence of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n   - The security risk score is zero for the same reasons.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports base their conclusions on the observable code, which is safe.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made; the analysis is based solely on static code review.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the analysis.\n   - The overall assessment that this is a benign, purely declarative module is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustment is needed.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms the code's benign and safe nature.",
