  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structures for the ssm-incidents service API, facilitating type safety and structured data handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs or untrusted sources; it defines data structures and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that handle untrusted data or interact with external systems within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "The code only establishes type definitions; no data flow, source-to-sink paths, or execution logic is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hidden code, or obfuscation. The code contains straightforward data class definitions with no embedded executable logic, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "This module strictly provides type annotations and data structure definitions for the ssm-incidents SDK. It uses standard Python typing features, conditional imports for compatibility, and no executable or runtime logic. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. All functions and classes serve solely to define data schemas, and there are no external interactions, code injections, or cryptic behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical type definitions module for a Python SDK. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The structure and content are consistent with standard practice for type annotations and data schemas. There is no evidence of malware or security issues.",
