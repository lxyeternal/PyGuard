  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code only defines data structures and type annotations for the ssm-incidents SDK. No external inputs, sinks, or executable logic are present. No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** This is accurate. The code is purely type definitions, with no runtime or external interactions.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is solely for static type definitions, with no runtime logic or external data handling. No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is standard for type annotations and data schemas.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** The code only contains type definitions, no executable logic, data handling, or suspicious patterns. It uses standard libraries and local literals for type annotations.\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is primarily static type definitions with no runtime logic or external data processing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code serves as a data schema module.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing that the code is solely for type annotations and data structures, with no executable or malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious patterns or security concerns are evident.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Summary:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is purely type definitions with no executable logic, external data handling, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware and Obfuscation:** No signs of malware or obfuscation are present in any report.\n\n- **Risk Score:** All assessments assign a risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Scores Consistency:** The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for a Python SDK. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports are accurate, and their scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the assessments provided.",
