  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code to identify any potential security issues, malware, obfuscation, or inconsistencies.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of type definitions using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No executable logic, data processing, external system interactions, or runtime code.\n- No hardcoded secrets, cryptic patterns, or obfuscated code.\n- All imports are from standard libraries or local literals, used solely for type annotations.\n- The purpose is to facilitate static type checking and data validation for the ssm-incidents SDK.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. The code only defines data structures and type annotations; no runtime or executable code is present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  None apparent. The code appears well-structured, with standard practices for type annotations and compatibility.\n\n- **Scores and their reasonableness:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's nature as purely static type definitions.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  Not applicable; all scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The code contains no malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious patterns. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is only for type annotations and data schemas.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  All reports assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports correctly identify that this module is purely for type definitions, with no executable or malicious code.\n- No hidden or obfuscated code patterns are present.\n- No external data handling or potential attack vectors are evident.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, standard type definitions module for a Python SDK.**\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks in this code. The provided reports are accurate and reasonable. The scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and overall security risk.\n\n**My estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the nature of the code.",
