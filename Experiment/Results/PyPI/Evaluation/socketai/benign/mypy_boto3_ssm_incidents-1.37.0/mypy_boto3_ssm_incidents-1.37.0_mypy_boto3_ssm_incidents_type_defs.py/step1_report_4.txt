  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structure declarations for the ssm-incidents service module, intended for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, datetime, typing, and internal literals; type annotation definitions; class and variable declarations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no functions or runtime data handling present; primarily static type definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows or runtime execution paths; the code only defines data structures and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is a straightforward type definition module. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of TypedDict classes, type aliases, and conditional imports based on Python version, which are standard for type hinting. No runtime logic, network calls, or data manipulation is present. The module appears solely for static type safety and documentation. No suspicious or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type definition module for a Python SDK or client library, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It does not perform any runtime operations or data handling that could pose a security risk.",
