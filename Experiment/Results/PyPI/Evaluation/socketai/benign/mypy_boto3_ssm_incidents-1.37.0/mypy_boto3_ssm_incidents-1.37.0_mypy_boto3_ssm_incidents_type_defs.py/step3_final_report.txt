  "purpose": "Type annotations for ssm-incidents service type definitions.",
  "sources": "All type definitions, class declarations, and import statements for static type annotations and data schemas.",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains no runtime or external data handling, only static type declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is purely declarative with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard Python typing constructs, conditional imports, and local literals without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for compatibility. There are no runtime operations, external data handling, or executable code. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is to serve as a schema for static type checking within the SDK. All signals indicate benign, purely declarative data schemas with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of type definitions for the ssm-incidents SDK. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
