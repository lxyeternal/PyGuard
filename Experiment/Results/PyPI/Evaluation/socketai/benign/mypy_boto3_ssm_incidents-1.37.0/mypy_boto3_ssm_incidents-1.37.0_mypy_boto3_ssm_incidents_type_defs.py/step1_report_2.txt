{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for the ssm-incidents service, used for static type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "All data originates from function parameters, type annotations, and constants defined within the module; no external input handling or data parsing present.",
  "sinks": "No unsafe data handling, external data processing, or output to network/IO is evident in the code.",
  "flows": "Type annotations guide data flow within the code but do not involve untrusted data processing; no runtime data flow analysis is applicable.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains standard type definitions with no embedded executable logic, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The module solely consists of TypedDict and Union type definitions for static type checking. No functions, data processing, or runtime code is present. The imports are standard and used solely for typing purposes. No code injection, dynamic execution, or external data handling is detected. The code appears to be generated or maintained for type annotations, documentation, and SDK structure. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely type definition declarations with no executable logic or data handling. There are no indicators of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is a standard, benign SDK typing module.",
