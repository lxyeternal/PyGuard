  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, unreasonable scores, or overlooked issues.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is solely for type definitions and data schemas.\n- No executable logic, external data handling, or runtime operations are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code uses standard Python typing features, conditional imports for compatibility, and typical SDK data structures.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as pure type definitions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Fully aligned with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, emphasizing no executable code or external data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Reinforces the benign nature, no executable logic or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms no runtime operations, only static type definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Similar findings, emphasizing the safety and lack of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. There is no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with straightforward type definitions.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of executable or external data handling.\n\n**Are there any overlooked issues?**  \n- No. The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as a benign, purely declarative type definitions module.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores align with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is a standard type annotations module with no malicious or obfuscated content. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Note:** No changes needed. The security posture of this code is benign.",
