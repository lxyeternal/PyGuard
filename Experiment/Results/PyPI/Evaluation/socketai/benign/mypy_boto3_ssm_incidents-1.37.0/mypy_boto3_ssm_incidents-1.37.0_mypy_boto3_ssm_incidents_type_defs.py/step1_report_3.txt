  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structures for ssm-incidents service, used for data validation and type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, and local literals; all are standard libraries or type annotations; no external data sources or input handling detected.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No code performs data processing, network calls, or untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "There are no executable flows; the code solely defines types and data structures without runtime logic or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code strictly consists of type annotations and data structure definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises structured type definitions using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports based on Python version. It imports standard libraries and local literals for type annotations. No executable code, no data input/output handling, and no suspicious behaviors are present. All code serves to facilitate static type checking and data validation for the ssm-incidents SDK. There are no signs of malicious or obfuscated code, backdoors, or external data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining data structures for the ssm-incidents SDK. It contains no executable logic, network interactions, or malicious patterns. Overall, it appears safe and intended solely for type validation. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
