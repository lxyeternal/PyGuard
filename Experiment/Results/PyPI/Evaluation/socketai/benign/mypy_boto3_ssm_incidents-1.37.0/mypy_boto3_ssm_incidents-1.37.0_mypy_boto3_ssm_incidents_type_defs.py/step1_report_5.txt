{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structures for the ssm-incidents service, facilitating type safety and clarity in the API interactions.",
  "sources": "Constant import statements, class and function definitions, and data type annotations throughout the module.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily defines data schemas without executing external or system-level commands.",
  "flows": "The code defines data flow structures for inputs, outputs, and internal data representation; no runtime data flows involving external inputs are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely declarative with no executable logic, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation; no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets are identified.",
  "analysis": "The module consists of type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and conditional imports based on Python version, aimed at providing structured data types for the service. It does not include executable code, external data processing, or security-sensitive operations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are present. The import of typing extensions and conditional imports are standard for compatibility, not malicious. Overall, it functions as a type definition library with no evident security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, standard type declaration module for a Python SDK, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
