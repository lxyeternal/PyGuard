  "purpose": "Defines a version string and assigns an imported class to a variable for instrumentation purposes in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module; hardcoded version string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or external effects detected.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only performs import and assignment operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, assigns it to a variable, and sets a version string. All operations are standard and benign. No data flow or external communication is present, and no suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward module setup for instrumentation with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
