  "purpose": "Define and assign a class alias for PrometheusFastApiInstrumentator from a local instrumentation module, and set the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module .instrumentation",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external effect found",
  "flows": "Import from instrumentation module -> assignment to Instrumentator",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual behavior present",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module, assigns a version string, and creates an alias for the class. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data leakage, or code injection. The code appears straightforward, serving the purpose of setting up instrumentation and versioning. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple setup snippet for a monitoring tool with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It appears safe and standard for a Python package module.",
