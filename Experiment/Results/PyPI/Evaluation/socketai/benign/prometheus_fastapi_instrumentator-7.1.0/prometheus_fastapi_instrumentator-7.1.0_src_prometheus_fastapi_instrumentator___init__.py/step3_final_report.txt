  "purpose": "Setup code for importing a monitoring class, setting version, and creating an alias.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module, version string assignment",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data flow present",
  "flows": "Import source to alias, version string to variable",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import, assigns a version string, and creates an alias for a class. It contains no network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The purpose appears to be for instrumentation setup in a FastAPI application, which is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk approximately 0.05-0.1) are appropriate given its simple setup nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
