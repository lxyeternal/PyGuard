  "purpose": "The code defines an alias for the PrometheusFastApiInstrumentator class from the instrumentation module and sets a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing PrometheusFastApiInstrumentator from a local module; setting __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points, no untrusted data handling or external network communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets variables and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module, defines a version string, and creates an alias. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be standard setup code for a Python package or module, with no network activity, no code injection, and no obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of straightforward imports and variable assignments with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
