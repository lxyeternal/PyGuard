  "purpose": "Define and initialize a Prometheus instrumentation class for FastAPI monitoring.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '.instrumentation', and a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static assignment and import are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward import and assignment without obfuscated code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, assigns a version string, and creates an alias for the imported class. No external data input, no execution of dynamic code, and no suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, simple, and appears to be part of a monitoring setup. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
