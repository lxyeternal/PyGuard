{
  "purpose": "This code defines an alias for a class imported from a local module, likely for instrumentation purposes in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module '.instrumentation'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code only assigns a class to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, sets a version string, and creates an alias for the imported class. There are no external inputs, no network activities, and no sensitive data handling. The structure is straightforward and typical for configuration or setup scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple alias assignment for instrumentation purposes within a larger application. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
