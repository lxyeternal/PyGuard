{
  "purpose": "Provides a set of ready-to-use Prometheus instrumentation functions for monitoring HTTP requests, responses, sizes, and latencies in a Starlette-based application.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'prometheus_client', 'starlette.requests', and 'starlette.responses'. No user input or external data sources are directly read in the code.",
  "sinks": "Metrics are created and labeled with data from 'Info' objects; data is observed and incremented in Prometheus metrics. No direct data sinks or external data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "Instrumentation functions receive 'Info' objects containing request/response data, extract metrics, and update Prometheus metrics. No external network communication or data leaks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard for Prometheus instrumentation; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation. Exception handling around metric creation addresses duplication issues but does not perform harmful actions. The code does not contain hidden behaviors or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple instrumentation functions that create Prometheus metrics (Histograms, Counters, Summaries) with configurable labels. It uses try-except blocks to handle metric registration errors caused by duplicate metrics, which is a common pattern in middleware to prevent errors during repeated registrations. No data is sent externally; metrics are only updated locally. No suspicious external network calls, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code is well-structured, clear, and standard for performance monitoring. No signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Prometheus instrumentation for a Starlette application. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is to facilitate metrics collection; no suspicious or harmful actions are present.",
