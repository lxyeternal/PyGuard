{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for retrieving route names from Starlette HTTP requests for routing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the request's scope and route definitions to determine the route name.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not write or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Input: request.scope and route configurations -> Output: computed route name string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution are detected. The code relies solely on library calls and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing and Starlette modules, and defines functions to traverse route objects to identify the route name associated with a request. It considers mounted sub-routes and handles redirect scenarios for trailing slashes, aligning with standard routing logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The logic is conventional, well-structured, and adheres to typical routing handling without any obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for route name resolution within a Starlette-based web application. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. The functions serve standard routing purposes without executing untrusted code or data flows.",
