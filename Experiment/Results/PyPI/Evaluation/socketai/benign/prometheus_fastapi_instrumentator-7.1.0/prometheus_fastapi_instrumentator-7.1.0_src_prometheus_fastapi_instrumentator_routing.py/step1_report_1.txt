{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for route name resolution in a Starlette web application, handling route matching and trailing slash redirection.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the request object (request.app, request.scope, request.app.routes), and uses the route definitions to determine the route name.",
  "sinks": "There are no significant sinks for untrusted data that could lead to data leaks or harmful effects. The code primarily performs route matching logic.",
  "flows": "Input (request data) -> _get_route_name evaluates route matches -> get_route_name processes possible redirection -> output route name",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior. The code relies solely on route matching logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs route resolution by matching the request scope against a set of route objects, including handling mounted sub-routes and trailing slash redirects. The functions are straightforward, focusing on route matching and string manipulation. No untrusted input is used in unsafe ways, and no suspicious code patterns or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard route-matching utility for Starlette applications with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data insecurely or perform any harmful actions.",
