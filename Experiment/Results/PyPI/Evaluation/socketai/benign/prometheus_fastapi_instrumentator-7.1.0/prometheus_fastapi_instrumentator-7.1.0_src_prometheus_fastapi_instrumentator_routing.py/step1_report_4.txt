{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for routing in a web application, specifically to retrieve route names based on request scope, including handling mount points and trailing slash redirects.",
  "sources": "The functions read data from the HTTPConnection object (request), specifically request.app and request.scope, and the routes defined in the application object.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that lead to untrusted data leakage or harmful actions. The code does not execute untrusted input or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Input data from request.scope and request.app.routes flows through the _get_route_name function, which matches routes and constructs route names. The get_route_name function additionally handles redirect logic but does not execute untrusted code or send data outside the process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. The redirect logic is standard for handling trailing slashes, with no malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, external connections, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly retrieves route names from the request scope, including handling mounts and redirects for trailing slashes. It relies on standard data structures and functions provided by the Starlette framework. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The logic is straightforward, and the code adheres to common web routing patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for route name retrieval within a Starlette web application. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, no external network interactions, and does not process untrusted data in a harmful manner. Overall, it appears safe and standard.",
