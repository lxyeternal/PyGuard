{
  "purpose": "The module provides helper functions for routing in a web application framework, specifically for extracting route names from HTTP requests in a Starlette-based application.",
  "sources": "Reads request scope (`request.scope`) and request object (`request.app`, `request`) to determine route names.",
  "sinks": "The code does not interact with untrusted data in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities; it mainly performs data retrieval and string concatenation.",
  "flows": "Input: request.scope and request.app.routes → Processing: matching routes and constructing route name → Output: route name string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code relies on library methods (`route.matches`) and manipulates route path strings, which is normal for route resolution logic.",
  "analysis": "The code accurately resolves route names for requests, including handling slash redirection for trailing slashes, by recursively matching routes and managing route paths. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are evident. There is no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code's purpose is to facilitate routing in a web framework, and it does so using standard library functions and safe string operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard route resolution logic in a web application, with no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward utility module with no harmful behavior.",
