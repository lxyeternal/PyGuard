{
  "purpose": "The code provides a management interface for Snowflake database objects, including listing, retrieving, and dropping databases, schemas, tables, views, procedures, and functions. It also registers a regex UDF for internal filtering.",
  "sources": "Inputs from method parameters such as object names, patterns, and session methods like get_current_database/schema.",
  "sinks": "SQL commands constructed via string formatting, JSON parsing, and registration of user-defined functions (UDFs).",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into SQL commands and UDF registration; the regex UDF is used internally for filtering show results.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The only dynamic behavior is the registration of a regex UDF, which is encapsulated and used safely.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard management utility for Snowflake objects, employing typical SDK patterns. The regex UDF registration is controlled and encapsulated within a lock, indicating safe internal use. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic SQL construction is controlled via parsing functions, minimizing injection risk. The overall structure and behavior are consistent with benign management code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured management interface with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk (around 0.1) are justified. The only dynamic feature, the regex UDF registration, is a utility function used internally and is safe. Overall, the security posture is very high, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.",
