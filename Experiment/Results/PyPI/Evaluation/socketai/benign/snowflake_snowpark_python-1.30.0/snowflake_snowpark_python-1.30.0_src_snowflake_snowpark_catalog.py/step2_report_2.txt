  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a class managing Snowflake objects, with inputs via method parameters, patterns, and regex filters.\n- **Sinks:** SQL commands via `self._session.sql()`, JSON parsing, regex filtering.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The regex UDF registration is encapsulated and used internally.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard database management code, very low security risk, malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies no malicious activity, and the code appears safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar management functions, with user inputs and session methods.\n- **Sinks:** SQL commands, UDF registration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior. The regex UDF registration is benign and encapsulated.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard utility code, low security risk, malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with report 1; no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Administrative functions for Snowflake objects, with session and user inputs.\n- **Sinks:** SQL commands, UDF registration, object fetch/drop.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The only notable feature is the registration of a regex UDF, which is safe and used internally.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard management code, very low security risk, malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; the code is a typical management wrapper.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar management functions, with standard session interactions.\n- **Sinks:** SQL commands, UDF registration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The registration of a regex UDF is benign; no malicious code detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard SDK usage, malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious behavior, consistent with prior reports.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—object management via session and internal calls.\n- **Sinks:** SQL commands, UDF registration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code; the regex UDF registration is a utility feature, not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard, safe code, malware score 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Malware risk score:** All reports agree on 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, primarily because the code is a management utility with no malicious payloads or suspicious behaviors.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The use of regex UDF registration, while potentially risky if misused, is encapsulated and appears safe in context.\n- No evidence of command injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The dynamic SQL commands are constructed with controlled parameters, and no unvalidated user input is directly executed as code.\n\n---\n\n### **Estimated scores:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Score |\n|--------------------|--------------|\n| Malware            | 0            |\n| Obfuscated         | 0            |\n| Risk               | 0.1 – 0.2    |\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, well-structured database management utility. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical management interface for Snowflake objects, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security posture is very high, with malware risk at zero and minimal security risk. The use of regex UDF registration is a utility feature, not a threat.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, due to dynamic SQL and UDF registration, but safe in context)",
