  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured management interface with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk (around 0.1) are justified. The only dynamic feature, the regex UDF registration, is a utility function used internally and is safe. Overall, the security posture is very high, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity."
