  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages Snowflake objects, employs regex filtering via a registered UDF, and performs standard listing, getting, and dropping operations. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The use of a regex UDF is safe and encapsulated. No suspicious behavior. The low risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard management patterns, safe use of regex UDF, and no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The regex UDF is a utility, not malicious. Slightly higher risk score than Report 1 but still low, which seems appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues with the report. The risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a management utility with standard patterns, safe usage of session methods, and no malicious code. The only dynamic behavior is regex UDF registration, which is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is thorough. The low risk score is justified. No obfuscation or malware detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's evaluation is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing safe patterns, standard SDK usage, and no malicious activity. The regex UDF registration is controlled.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code structure. Slightly higher risk score is acceptable given the pattern, but still low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the safe, standard management patterns, with no signs of malicious code. The regex UDF is a benign utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the other reports and the code analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is accurate. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 across reports, reflecting minimal security concerns primarily due to dynamic SQL and UDF registration, which are controlled and safe in context.\n\n**Final Expert Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the controlled use of dynamic SQL and UDF registration.\n- **Additional notes:** The only dynamic behavior is the registration of a regex UDF for internal filtering, which is a common pattern and appears safe here.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and accurate. No adjustments needed. The overall security posture of this code is very low risk, with no malware or obfuscation detected.",
