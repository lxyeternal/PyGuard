{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for Snowpark client-side errors and internal exceptions used in Snowflake's Python SDK.",
  "sources": "import statements, class __init__ methods, and string formatting for error messages",
  "sinks": "Potentially, error messages could be exposed in logs or user-facing outputs; no direct sink to external systems or network calls observed.",
  "flows": "Error object creation and raising exceptions based on internal or SQL-related errors; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscated code, no external network activity, no code injection points, no data leakage mechanisms. Error handling uses standard patterns, no unusual dynamic execution or eval-like functions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a hierarchy of exception classes with structured error information, designed for internal SDK use. The classes include optional attributes for detailed error context, such as error codes and connection info. The design follows standard Python exception practices, with no suspicious logic, network calls, or data leaks. The error messages are constructed via string formatting but contain no untrusted data sources or external interactions. No anomalies suggest malicious intent. The code's purpose is clearly for structured error handling, with no indication of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, well-structured set of custom exception classes for a Python SDK. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. No security risks are evident. The code's sole function is to represent error conditions cleanly.",
