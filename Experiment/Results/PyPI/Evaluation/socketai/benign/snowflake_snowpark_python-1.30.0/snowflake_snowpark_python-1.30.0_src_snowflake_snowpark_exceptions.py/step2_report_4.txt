  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Summary:**\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for Snowflake's Snowpark SDK.\n   - Classes include categories like internal errors, data frame errors, SQL errors, session errors, etc.\n   - Exception classes store error messages, error codes, and contextual data such as connection info.\n   - No network calls, data processing, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - The code is purely for structured error handling.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior Assessment:**\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n   - No external network activity, code injection, or data leaks.\n   - Exception messages are constructed from internal variables; no untrusted data sources are processed.\n   - The code follows standard Python exception patterns.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0.0 — No malicious activity or code behaviors are present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — The code is clear, straightforward, and readable.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0.0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities are evident.\n   \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious intent, with high confidence (1.0).\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Anomalies:**\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.\n   - Exception classes are typical for SDK error categorization.\n   - No signs of supply chain attack, code injection, or malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a typical, well-structured set of custom exception classes.\n   - It does not pose security risks or contain malicious behavior.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- I agree with the reported scores of malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and risk = 0.\n- The code is safe, standard, and intended solely for error handling.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
