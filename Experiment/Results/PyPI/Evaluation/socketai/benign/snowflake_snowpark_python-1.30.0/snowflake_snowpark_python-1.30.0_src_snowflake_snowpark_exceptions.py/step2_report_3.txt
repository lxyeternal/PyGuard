  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Purpose & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for Snowpark, a client SDK for Snowflake.\n   - It includes various categories such as internal errors, data frame errors, SQL errors, session errors, etc.\n   - The classes store error messages, codes, and contextual information, facilitating structured error handling.\n   - The code is purely definitional, with no operational logic, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n   - No obfuscation, code injection, or external network interactions.\n   - The exception classes are standard, with no use of eval, exec, or other potentially dangerous functions.\n   - Error messages are formatted with class attributes, but no untrusted data sources are involved.\n   - The code does not perform any I/O, data leaks, or malicious actions.\n\n3. **Error Handling & Categorization**:\n   - The exception hierarchy is well-structured, categorizing errors logically.\n   - The use of optional attributes like `error_code`, `sfqid`, `query`, etc., provides detailed context.\n   - The design aligns with best practices for SDK error handling.\n\n4. **Assessment of Reports**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious patterns.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.\n   - The purpose is solely to define exception classes for internal SDK use.\n\n5. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0.0 — No malicious behavior, network activity, or code injection detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0 — Clear, readable class definitions with no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0.0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n   \n   Since the code is purely definitional with no operational or external interactions, these scores are appropriate.\n\n6. **Potential Concerns & Assumptions**:\n   - The only potential concern could be if error messages included untrusted data, leading to injection or leakage. However, the code only formats messages from internal attributes, which are set internally and not from external sources.\n   - The exception classes could be used improperly if logs are exposed, but that is outside the scope of this code.\n\n**Final Summary**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for an SDK, with no malicious or security-risk elements.",
