{
  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of custom exception classes for Snowpark client-side error handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements and class initializations. No external data input or untrusted sources are read.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages and attributes that could potentially be exposed if caught and logged improperly, but no external data flows are explicitly coded.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The code primarily defines exception classes with standard message handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various custom exceptions used within Snowpark. These classes handle error messaging and metadata related to Snowflake errors. No external inputs are processed, nor is there any code execution, network communication, or data manipulation that could be malicious. The exception classes are well-structured and include optional error codes and attributes for error context, but these are standard practice for error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional for exception handling within a Snowflake SDK and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not pose security threats and appears safe.",
