  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Snowflake's Snowpark SDK.\n   - No executable logic, network calls, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - Error messages are constructed via string formatting, but only include internal, structured data.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - No misinterpretations or logical flaws are evident in the assessments.\n   - The analysis correctly identifies that these are class definitions for structured error handling.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, security risks of 0, and obfuscated scores of 0.\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk here is 0, which is justified because:\n     - No malicious activity is present.\n     - The code is purely definitional.\n     - No external or untrusted data is processed.\n   - Therefore, the risk scores are appropriately low.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.\n   - The malware score of 0 across reports is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent.\n   - They recognize the code as standard exception handling classes.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified that would warrant higher scores.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of custom exception classes.\n- It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements.\n- The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.\n\n**My Own Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final Justification:**\nThis code serves solely as a structured error handling framework within a Python SDK. It is benign, standard, and free from malicious patterns or vulnerabilities.",
