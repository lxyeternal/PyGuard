{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Snowpark client-side errors and their categorization.",
  "sources": "None (the code only defines classes and imports; no data input sources).",
  "sinks": "None (no data processing or handling that could lead to data leaks or exploits).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow between sources and sinks; primarily class definitions and constructors).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; standard exception class definitions, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various custom exceptions used in Snowpark. It imports standard libraries and a Snowflake connector error class. No input/output handling, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The structure follows typical Python exception patterns and is consistent with standard SDK or API error handling implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error categorization within Snowpark. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a straightforward, well-structured error handling module without any malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
