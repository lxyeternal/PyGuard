  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Purpose**:\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for Snowpark SDK.\n   - It includes various specific exceptions, error code ranges, and optional detailed error attributes.\n   - The code is purely structural, with no operational logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No network calls, dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or code injection points.\n   - Error messages are formatted for clarity but do not include untrusted data sources or external inputs.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Anomalies**:\n   - The code is standard for SDK error handling.\n   - It does not perform any operations that could lead to data leaks, code execution, or malicious activity.\n   - The exception classes are well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — No malware or malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — Code is clear, well-structured, with no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities are evident; this is a typical exception hierarchy.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of exception classes for error handling in Snowflake's Python SDK.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The detailed error handling and categorization are standard practices.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Overall**:\n- The code is safe, benign, and appropriate for its purpose.\n- It does not pose any security threat or supply chain risk.",
