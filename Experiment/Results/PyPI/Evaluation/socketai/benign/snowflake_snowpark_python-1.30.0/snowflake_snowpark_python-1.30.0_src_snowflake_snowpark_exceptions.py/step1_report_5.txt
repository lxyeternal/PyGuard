{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Snowpark client-side errors, enabling structured error handling and categorization within the Snowflake Snowpark SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements for logging and error classes; class initializers and attributes that process error messages and codes.",
  "sinks": "None; the code primarily defines exception classes and does not handle untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from sources to sinks, as this code only defines exception classes without data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of custom exceptions for the Snowflake Snowpark SDK, organizing errors into categories like internal errors, data frame errors, SQL errors, and session errors. It uses standard class inheritance from Python's Exception base class, with some constructors capturing detailed error context (e.g., error codes, error messages, connection error info). The code appears to be straightforward, following typical Python exception design patterns, with no indications of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling within the SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions for a Python SDK.",
