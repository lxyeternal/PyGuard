  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Purpose**:\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes used in Snowflake's Snowpark SDK.\n   - It includes classes for various error categories, such as internal errors, data frame errors, SQL errors, session errors, etc.\n   - The classes are well-structured, with optional attributes for detailed error context, such as error codes, connection info, and query identifiers.\n   - No operational logic, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - The code uses standard Python exception patterns and straightforward string formatting for error messages.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - There are no network calls, data leaks, or code injection points.\n   - The exception classes are purely for structured error handling, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n   - The use of optional attributes to enrich error context is standard practice and does not pose security risks.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports**:\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious patterns are detected.\n   - The reports consistently assign malware and security risk scores of 0, aligning with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no suspicious network or code injection.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — Clear, readable class definitions with no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — No security vulnerabilities or risks are evident; the code is purely definitional.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns**:\n   - The only possible concern might be if error messages inadvertently expose sensitive information; however, the code constructs messages from safe attributes and does not process untrusted input directly.\n   - The exception classes include optional attributes for detailed error context, which could be sensitive if misused, but this is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for error handling within the Snowflake Snowpark SDK.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code is safe, well-structured, and free of security concerns.",
