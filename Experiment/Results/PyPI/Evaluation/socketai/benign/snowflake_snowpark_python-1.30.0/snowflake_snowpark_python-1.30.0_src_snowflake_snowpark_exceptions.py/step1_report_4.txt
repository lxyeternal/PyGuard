{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for Snowpark client-side error handling and does not perform any operational logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "Constants, string formatting, and class initializers that set exception attributes and messages.",
  "sinks": "Logging setup is present but not actively used in this code; no data is read from untrusted sources or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input leading to external effects; exception creation is purely for error reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity. All classes are standard exception definitions with no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines exception classes for a specific SDK, establishing structured error handling. There are no network operations, data leaks, or code injection points. No embedded or obfuscated code is present. The exception classes store and format messages and error metadata, which is typical for error handling modules. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious side-effects are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign exception class module for a Snowpark SDK. It shows no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
