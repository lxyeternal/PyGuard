{
  "purpose": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for Snowflake's Snowpark SDK, categorizing errors related to internal issues, dataframes, SQL, sessions, and other components. It facilitates structured error handling and provides detailed error context through optional attributes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from internal error attributes such as message, error_code, conn_error, sfqid, query, sql_error_code, and raw_message to construct error messages and store error context.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not process untrusted input or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "Error attributes are used to generate formatted error messages; no data flows from external sources to sinks, as the code is purely definitional.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward class definitions for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of well-structured custom exception classes for Snowflake's SDK, with no operational logic, network activity, or data processing. It includes optional attributes for detailed error context, which are set internally and do not process untrusted data. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which is appropriate given its purpose. The design aligns with standard practices for SDK error handling, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of custom exception classes for structured error handling in Snowflake's Python SDK. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious behavior, and is free of obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are accurate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
