{
  "purpose": "This code defines the SnowflakeFile class for use within Snowflake UDFs and stored procedures, providing an interface similar to Python's IOBase for file operations in a Snowflake environment.",
  "sources": "Class methods (open, open_new_result) that instantiate SnowflakeFile objects; constructor (__init__) that sets file location and mode; class attributes such as _file_location, _mode, and flags.",
  "sinks": "Methods like close, detach, fileno, flush, read, write, seek, and others intended to operate on or manipulate file streams. However, most are not implemented and raise NotImplementedError.",
  "flows": "Instantiation via open/open_new_result -> usage of methods like close or read/write (not implemented here) -> raising NotImplementedError or performing no action. No untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "All operational methods are stubs that raise NotImplementedError, indicating they are placeholders. No code executes sensitive operations like data transmission, credential access, or backdoors. Deprecated parameters (is_owner_file) are documented. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of class and method definitions with no actual implementation logic. It provides an API interface for file handling in Snowflake's environment, with many methods intentionally unimplemented. There are no data leaks, network operations, or suspicious code segments. The use of placeholder errors and the absence of runtime code suggest this is a framework or interface stub, not malicious code. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as an interface stub for Snowflake file operations in UDFs and stored procedures. It contains no executable logic that could be malicious. All operational methods are intentionally unimplemented and raise NotImplementedError, indicating this is a scaffold rather than active malicious code. Therefore, it poses no security threat.",
