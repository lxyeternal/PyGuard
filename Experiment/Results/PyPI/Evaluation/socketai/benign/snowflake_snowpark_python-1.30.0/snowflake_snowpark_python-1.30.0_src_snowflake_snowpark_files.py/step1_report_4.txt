{
  "purpose": "The code defines a SnowflakeFile class for handling file operations within Snowflake UDFs and stored procedures, primarily providing an interface similar to Python's IOBase for remote file access.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from parameters like file_location, mode, is_owner_file, require_scoped_url, and from_result_api in class methods, especially open and open_new_result.",
  "sinks": "The code could potentially send data or status via methods like write, which are not implemented, or raise NotImplementedError, but no actual data sinks are explicitly used in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into class attributes during instantiation; however, actual IO operations are not implemented, so no runtime data flow occurs within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The class methods related to reading and writing are placeholders that raise NotImplementedError; no actual file handling or data processing occurs. The code does not include any malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors. The only noteworthy point is the placeholder functions and the detailed comments, which are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a class structure for remote file handling within Snowflake's environment. It uses class methods to create file objects with specific access modes and contains several unimplemented methods that would handle actual IO operations. No external data input is processed, and no data is sent or leaked. The placeholder methods prevent actual malicious activity, and no obfuscated or suspicious code is present. The imports and class setup appear standard. The focus on handling remote files in a controlled environment aligns with Snowflake's architecture, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious interface for remote file handling within Snowflake's UDFs and stored procedures. It primarily consists of method definitions that raise NotImplementedError, serving as placeholders, and contains no malicious logic or anomalies. The overall security risk is minimal, with no active data processing or external communications.",
