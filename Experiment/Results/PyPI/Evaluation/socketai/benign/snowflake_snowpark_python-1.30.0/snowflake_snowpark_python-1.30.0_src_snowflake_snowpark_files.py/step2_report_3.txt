  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a class definition for SnowflakeFile, intended for use within Snowflake's UDFs and stored procedures.\n- The class methods are primarily placeholders that raise NotImplementedError, indicating no active I/O or data processing occurs.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or active data transmission is present.\n- The code appears to be a scaffold or API interface tailored for a controlled environment, not executing any risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of code:** The code is present and correctly implements the class structure as described.\n- **Malicious activity:** No malicious activity is evident. The code does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or execute commands.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- **Security risks:** The code's limited functionality and environment-specific design suggest minimal security risk.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The code contains deprecated parameters (`is_owner_file`) and placeholder methods that raise NotImplementedError, but these are consistent with an interface scaffold, not bugs.\n- The documentation is thorough and accurate; no logical errors are apparent.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — No malicious behavior, payload, or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — Clear, well-structured code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — Very low; the code is a safe interface scaffold with no active operations or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code's purpose is to serve as a controlled API for Snowflake's environment, with most methods intentionally unimplemented.\n- The presence of placeholder errors and detailed comments is standard for such interface classes.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified based on this code alone.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe low risk score reflects the code's benign, environment-specific nature, and the malware score is zero due to the absence of any malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a benign, environment-specific interface scaffold for Snowflake UDFs and stored procedures. It contains no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or active data transmission. The reported scores are appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.",
