  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, considering the code and the provided evaluations.\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious Behavior or Malware:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is a structural stub or interface meant for Snowflake's environment.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, network activity, credential handling, or code injection.\n- The code contains only class definitions with methods raising NotImplementedError, indicating placeholders rather than executable logic.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are detected.\n\n**2. Code Functionality and Logic:**\n- The code defines a class `SnowflakeFile` intended for use within Snowflake UDFs/stored procedures.\n- Most methods are unimplemented and raise `NotImplementedError`, serving as an interface or scaffold.\n- The constructor and class methods set internal state but do not perform any I/O or data processing.\n- No external input sources or data sinks are present.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n\n**3. Risks and Scores Justification:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, unminified, and non-obfuscated code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Very low (around 0.1), justified because the code is a controlled API stub with no active operations or data leaks.\n\n**4. Potential Concerns or Misinterpretations:**\n- The only minor concern is the deprecated parameter `is_owner_file`, but its usage is documented and not malicious.\n- The placeholder methods raise errors to prevent misuse, which is standard for interface definitions.\n\n**5. Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and content.\n- No report suggests any active threat or malicious intent.\n- The high confidence levels (0.9 or 1) are justified given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, environment-specific API scaffold)\n\n**Overall, the code appears benign, intended as a controlled interface for Snowflake's environment, with no malicious activity or vulnerabilities.**",
