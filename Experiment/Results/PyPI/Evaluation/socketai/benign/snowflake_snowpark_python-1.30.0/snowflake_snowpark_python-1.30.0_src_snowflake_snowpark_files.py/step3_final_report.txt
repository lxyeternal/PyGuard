  "malware": 0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "purpose": "API scaffold for Snowflake UDFs and stored procedures, providing an interface for file operations within Snowflake's environment.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters (file_location, mode, is_owner_file, require_scoped_url), class methods accepting parameters for file access",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data output",
  "flows": "Initialization with parameters; method calls that raise NotImplementedError; no active data flow or I/O",
  "anomalies": "Most methods are placeholders raising NotImplementedError; deprecated parameter is documented but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class intended as an interface for Snowflake's environment, with most methods unimplemented and raising errors. No data processing, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The scores reflect the benign, scaffold nature of the code, with a very low security risk and no obfuscation. The code's purpose is to serve as a controlled API, not to execute logic or handle sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, environment-specific API scaffold with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its purpose.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
