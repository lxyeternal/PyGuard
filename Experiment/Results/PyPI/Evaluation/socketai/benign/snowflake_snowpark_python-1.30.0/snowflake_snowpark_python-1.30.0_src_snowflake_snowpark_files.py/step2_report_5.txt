  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**\n   - The code is a class definition with many methods raising `NotImplementedError`. It is clearly designed as an interface or scaffold for Snowflake's environment, not executing any actual I/O or network operations.\n   - No data exfiltration, network activity, credential handling, or code injection is present.\n   - The code does not process untrusted input beyond constructor parameters, which are standard for environment-specific API classes.\n   - No suspicious or malicious payloads are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code is primarily a stub with placeholder methods. While this limits functionality, it is consistent with its purpose as an environment-specific interface.\n   - Deprecated parameter `is_owner_file` is noted but not malicious; it's documented as for deprecation.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are apparent given its role as a scaffold.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are low (~0.1), which is reasonable considering the code is a stub/interface with no active operations.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n   - The confidence levels are high (~0.9-1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a structural API with no active malicious behavior, higher risk scores are unjustified.\n   - The code does not perform any data transmission, credential access, or execute code that could be malicious.\n   - The environment-specific nature and the placeholder methods further reduce the risk.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions and Claims:**\n   - Some reports mention \"potential vulnerabilities\" but these are unfounded here because the code is not executing any logic, only defining an interface.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are justified based solely on this code.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature as a non-operational, environment-specific interface.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — Minimal risk, mainly due to its role as a scaffold, not active code.\n\n**Overall Justification:**  \nThe code is a benign, environment-specific API scaffold for Snowflake UDFs and stored procedures. It contains no active logic, no data leaks, no network activity, and no malicious payloads. The placeholder methods and documentation suggest it's intended for controlled, internal use, further reducing risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe and non-malicious.  \n- The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and should remain as-is.  \n- No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
