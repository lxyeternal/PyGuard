{
  "purpose": "Define a class SnowflakeFile to interact with files within Snowflake UDFs and stored procedures, providing an IOBase-like interface for remote file access.",
  "sources": "The class reads input data primarily through method calls such as open, open_new_result, and potentially from file locations provided to these methods.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data exfiltration points are evident. The code does not perform network communication, data leakage, or command execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from provided file_location or from new result streams into class methods, but these are limited to file handling within Snowflake's environment and do not involve external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The class methods raise NotImplementedError for most IO operations, indicating limited functionality, and the class is intended solely for internal Snowflake operations. The constructor and methods are designed for UDF/stored procedure context, with no evidence of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Usage of deprecated parameters is noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for file handling within Snowflake's secure environment, with explicit limitations and restrictions. It only allows controlled file access, emphasizing security and sandboxing. No signs of code injection, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. The code's structure and purpose suggest it is for safe, restricted file operations, consistent with Snowflake's architecture. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a restricted file interface designed for Snowflake UDFs and stored procedures. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its limited functionality and environment-specific design reduce risk, and no indicators of malware are observed.",
