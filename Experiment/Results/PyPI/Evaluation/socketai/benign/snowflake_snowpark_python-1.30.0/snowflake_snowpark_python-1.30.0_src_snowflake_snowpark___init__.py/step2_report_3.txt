  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, considering the code, logic, potential security implications, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the script initializes core classes for Snowpark, importing modules, setting version info, and issuing warnings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted input or data flows; primarily static imports and warnings.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that this is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior is accurate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity) — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation) — justified.  \n- Risk: 0 (no security risk) — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on module imports and version handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or untrusted sources involved.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** Standard deprecation warnings; no suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies the script as benign, with standard practices.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 — slightly above zero, possibly due to the deprecation warning, but this is minimal and benign.\n\n**Note:** The small security risk score is acceptable given the warning about Python 3.8 end-of-life, which is informational, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing module imports, version info, and warnings.\n- No untrusted data, no anomalies, no malicious code.\n- The deprecation warning is standard and non-threatening.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate, as the code is purely setup.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- Same observations: module imports, version info, deprecation warnings.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The assessment is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the benign nature.\n- No dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted input.\n- The deprecation warning is standard.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of malware or malicious behavior:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risk:** Minimal, primarily due to deprecation warnings, which are informational.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a standard package initialization script, importing modules, setting version info, and issuing deprecation warnings based on Python version. It contains no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no data leaks, and no obfuscated logic.\n\n**Estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to deprecation warning, which is benign and standard)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and does not pose a supply chain security threat.",
