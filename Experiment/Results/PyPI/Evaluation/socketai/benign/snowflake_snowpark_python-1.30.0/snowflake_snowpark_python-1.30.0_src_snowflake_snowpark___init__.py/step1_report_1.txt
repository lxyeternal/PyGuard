{
  "purpose": "This script initializes core classes and modules for Snowpark, a Python API for Snowflake, by importing various components and setting version information and warnings.",
  "sources": "Imports from snowflake.snowpark modules, version data, and system info. Also reads sys.version_info for Python version detection.",
  "sinks": "Warnings are generated based on Python version, but no untrusted input handling or sensitive data exposure observed.",
  "flows": "Python version info is read and used to trigger warnings; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The script primarily handles imports, version info, and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up the environment for Snowpark by importing modules, defining the package version, and issuing deprecation warnings. It performs a version check to warn users about Python 3.8 end-of-life, which is standard. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization script for Snowpark with version warnings and no malicious behavior. It does not contain malware, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is a safe, typical setup script.",
