{
  "purpose": "This code initializes core classes and modules for Snowpark, setting version info and issuing deprecation warnings for Python 3.8.",
  "sources": "Static imports, version tuple, and environment version checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; warnings are informational.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily static code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup: importing modules, defining version info, and issuing a deprecation warning if running on Python 3.8. There are no dynamic data flows, network activity, or user inputs. The warnings are standard notices about Python runtime support. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe package initialization script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The deprecation warning is standard and not malicious. The security risk score is effectively zero, and malware/obfuscated scores are zero.",
