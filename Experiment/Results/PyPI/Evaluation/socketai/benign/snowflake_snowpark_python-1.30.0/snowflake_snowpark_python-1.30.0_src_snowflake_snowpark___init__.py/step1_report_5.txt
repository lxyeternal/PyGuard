  "purpose": "This script sets up core classes and imports for the Snowpark Python SDK, primarily for data processing and database interactions within Snowflake.",
  "sources": "Imports from snowflake.snowpark modules, including version info and warning messages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code primarily handles imports, constants, and warnings.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the flow is limited to module setup and warnings.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a deprecation warning related to Python 3.8, but this is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules and sets warnings related to Python runtime support. No external data input, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or credential handling present. The deprecation message is informational and does not pose a security risk. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard SDK setup code for Snowflake's Snowpark library. It performs no malicious actions, does not handle untrusted input, and contains no suspicious behavior. It is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
