  "review": "Let's evaluate each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The code is a straightforward package initializer, importing modules, setting version info, and issuing a deprecation warning for Python 3.8. No user input, external data, or network activity is involved.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** No signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Assessment:** This is a standard, benign setup script with no security concerns.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, it handles imports, version info, and deprecation warnings. No external data processing or untrusted input.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** None detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low (0.1), justified by the presence of warnings, but these are benign.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, just environment setup.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same pattern—imports, version info, deprecation warnings. No data flow from untrusted sources.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** None.\n- **Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Assessment:** Safe, standard library initialization.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Consistent with previous reports—initialization, warnings, no external data handling.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** None.\n- **Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Assessment:** Benign setup code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above—imports, version, warnings, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** None.\n- **Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Assessment:** Safe, standard SDK setup.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is purely for module setup and warnings.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The only slight concern was the deprecation warning for Python 3.8, which is standard and not a security risk.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0 for all, as no malicious intent or code is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** Given the absence of any malicious or insecure behavior, a risk score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n\n**Overall, the code is a typical, benign package initialization script with no security issues or malicious content.**",
