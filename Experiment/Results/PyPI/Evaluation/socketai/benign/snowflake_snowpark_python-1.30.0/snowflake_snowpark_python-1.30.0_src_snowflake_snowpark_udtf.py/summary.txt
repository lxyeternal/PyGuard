  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-designed utility for UDTF registration in Snowflake. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The primary security concern is the potential for supply chain attacks via malicious handler code or dependencies, which is outside the scope of the code itself. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
