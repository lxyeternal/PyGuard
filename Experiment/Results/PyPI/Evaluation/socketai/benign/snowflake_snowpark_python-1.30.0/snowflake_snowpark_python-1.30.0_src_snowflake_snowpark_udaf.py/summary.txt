  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK component for registering UDAFs in Snowflake. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation is evident. The main risks stem from executing user-provided code and managing secrets, which are inherent in the system's design but do not indicate malicious intent. The security risk score is appropriately low, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero."
