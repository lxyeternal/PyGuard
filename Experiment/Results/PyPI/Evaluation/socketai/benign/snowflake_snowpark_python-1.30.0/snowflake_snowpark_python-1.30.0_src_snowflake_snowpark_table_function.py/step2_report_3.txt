  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: code functionality, potential security issues, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Flow:** The report describes the code as a standard component for constructing table function calls, with expression validation and no external interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The code is primarily internal, building expressions for query planning.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** The high risk score (0.95) seems unjustified given the code's nature. It is a typical SDK component with no external system calls, no dynamic code execution, and no signs of malicious intent. The malware score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on query construction and expression building.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Accepts user inputs like function names and arguments, but employs validation and quoting to mitigate injection risks. No external network activity or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The low malware score aligns with the analysis. The risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable, reflecting some potential for injection if inputs are malicious, but overall safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Focuses on constructing and managing table functions, with validation and expression building.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses internal APIs and standard validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scores. The code is a standard API component with minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Similar to above, handling table functions, expressions, and plan attributes.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity detected. Uses internal expression builders, with no external communication.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Focuses on expression building for table functions, with validation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code or sabotage. Potential injection risk exists if user inputs are malicious, but the functions are designed for safe translation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The malware score should be **0**. The risk score reflects some potential for injection but is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly indicate **0**. No malicious activity or backdoors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly low (0.1–0.2), which is appropriate given the code's nature as an SDK component with user input handling.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The **highest risk score (0.95)** in Report 1 is **unreasonable**. Given the code's purpose and the analysis, it should be **0**.\n- The other reports' scores are aligned with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (acceptable, minor potential injection risk with user inputs)\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a benign, well-structured SDK component with no malicious intent.",
