  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured part of Snowflake's SDK for building query expressions. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is potential injection via user inputs, but this is mitigated by quoting and validation. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk."
