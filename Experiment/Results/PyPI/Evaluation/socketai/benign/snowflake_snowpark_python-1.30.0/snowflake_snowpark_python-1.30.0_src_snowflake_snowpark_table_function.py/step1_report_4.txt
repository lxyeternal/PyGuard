{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions for handling table function calls within Snowflake's Snowpark Python API, including creating, modifying, and aliasing table functions for query execution.",
  "sources": "Code reads from function parameters (such as func_name, args, named_args, partition_by, order_by, aliases), internal attributes (_ast, _api_call_source, _partition_by, _order_by, _aliases). No external data sources or inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data; the code primarily constructs expressions and internal representations for query planning. No output to external systems, network, or file systems are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (func_name, args, named_args, partition_by, order_by, aliases) flow into expression building functions (e.g., build_expr_from_snowpark_column_or_col_name). These flow into constructing TableFunctionExpression objects, which are used internally for query planning. The flow involves converting user inputs into internal representations but does not execute or transmit data externally.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard and focuses on expression building and object modeling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The only potential concern is the use of internal attributes (_ast, _api_call_source) which could be manipulated if exposed externally, but that is standard for internal APIs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured API for constructing table function calls, including partitioning, ordering, and aliasing. It performs input validation (e.g., ensuring unique aliases, correct argument types) and constructs expression objects for query planning. No external data or network operations are performed. The functions that generate expressions do so in a controlled manner, converting parameters into internal expression representations. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code relies on internal APIs and expression-building utilities consistent with normal query planning behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate part of Snowflake's Snowpark API for handling table functions. There are no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It functions as an internal API component for building query expressions and managing table function configurations, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
