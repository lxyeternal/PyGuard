      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security considerations are the unsafe exec() call and reliance on environment variables without validation, which could be exploited if the environment or files are compromised. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal but noteworthy potential vulnerabilities."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-designed utility for UDTF registration in Snowflake. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The primary security concern is the potential for supply chain attacks via malicious handler code or dependencies, which is outside the scope of the code itself. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured management interface with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk (around 0.1) are justified. The only dynamic feature, the regex UDF registration, is a utility function used internally and is safe. Overall, the security posture is very high, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity."

The primary security consideration is potential injection via user inputs, but this is mitigated by quoting and validation. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk."

The main risks stem from executing user-provided code and managing secrets, which are inherent in the system's design but do not indicate malicious intent. The security risk score is appropriately low, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero."
