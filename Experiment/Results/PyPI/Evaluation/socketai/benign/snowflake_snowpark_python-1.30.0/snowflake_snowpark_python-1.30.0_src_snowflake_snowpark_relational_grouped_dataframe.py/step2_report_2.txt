  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and the overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes classes/functions for grouped DataFrame operations in Snowpark, including aggregation, pivoting, and pandas UDFs.\n- **Analysis:** The code constructs ASTs and plans for SQL execution, uses internal functions like `_expr_to_func` which dynamically generate expressions based on user input, but these are designed to interpret column names and functions safely. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or external network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a standard API implementation for data processing, with no malicious intent or backdoors. The risk score is 0.2, which seems appropriate given the internal plan construction.\n\n**Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** 0 each, Risk: 0.2.  \n**Verdict:** No issues. The security risk is minimal and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on data manipulation, aggregation, and UDF application.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code or external communication. The code relies on internal APIs and pandas for UDFs, which is standard. No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, legitimate data processing code. Security risk score 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n**Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** 0 each, Risk: 0.2.  \n**Verdict:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Implements grouping, aggregation, pivoting, and pandas UDFs.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity. Uses internal plan building, AST management, and pandas for UDFs. No network activity, no data exfiltration, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard implementation with no malicious behavior. Risk score 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n**Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** 0 each, Risk: 0.1.  \n**Verdict:** Safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar grouping, aggregation, pivot, and pandas UDF logic.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no external communication, no obfuscation. Uses internal APIs as expected.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate code, low security risk.\n\n**Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** 0 each, Risk: 0.1.  \n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Data manipulation and plan building.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, external network calls, or obfuscation. Uses internal APIs and standard pandas UDFs.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard SDK code, no malicious activity.\n\n**Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** 0 each, Risk: 0.2.  \n**Verdict:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity (score 0). The code is primarily internal API wrappers and plan builders.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected (score 0). The code is clear, structured, and uses standard patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation but generally low (0.1 - 0.2), justified by the internal nature of the code and lack of external communication or malicious patterns.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the code analysis.\n- No adjustments needed; the code appears safe, legitimate, and aligned with standard data processing frameworks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 – 0.2 (consistent with current scores)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured part of Snowflake's Snowpark API for grouped data operations. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements are present.",
