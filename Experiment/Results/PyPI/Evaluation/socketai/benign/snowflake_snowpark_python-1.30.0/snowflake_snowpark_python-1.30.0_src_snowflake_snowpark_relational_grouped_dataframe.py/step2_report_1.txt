  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk, while verifying the technical details.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes classes/functions for grouped DataFrame operations, with internal AST/plan creation.\n- **Analysis:** No evidence of malicious behavior; functions interpret user inputs to generate SQL plans. The use of `_expr_to_func` dynamically creates functions based on string inputs like \"avg\", \"stddev\", etc., but these are standard aggregate functions, not malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate API implementation for Snowflake's data processing, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, due to complexity but no malicious intent).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on data manipulation, with user-defined functions and plan construction.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious external communication, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code mainly manages ASTs and data transformations.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard data processing code; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Implements grouping, aggregation, pivoting, and pandas UDFs.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; the pandas UDF applies user functions securely, and the code manages ASTs for query plans.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure code for data operations.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focus on grouped data manipulation, including pandas UDFs.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, no external network activity, no obfuscation. The pandas UDF is used as intended.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, secure implementation.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, grouped data operations, AST/plan creation.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; no external communication, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code presence of malware:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code patterns or techniques observed.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, given the code is mainly API and plan construction logic.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nBased on the detailed review, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — very low, mainly due to the complexity of internal plan generation but no actual security concern.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions that these are standard, internal API functions for data manipulation within Snowflake's Snowpark framework, with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
