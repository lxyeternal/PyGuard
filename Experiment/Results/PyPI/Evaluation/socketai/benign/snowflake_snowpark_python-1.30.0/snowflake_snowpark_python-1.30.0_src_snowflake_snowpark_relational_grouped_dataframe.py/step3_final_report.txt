{
  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions for grouped DataFrame operations, including aggregation, pivoting, and pandas UDFs, constructing internal ASTs and execution plans for Snowflake Snowpark.",
  "sources": "User inputs such as column names, expressions, subqueries, and internal API calls for plan and AST creation.",
  "sinks": "Generated SQL plans, DataFrames, and internal plan nodes; no external network communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Inputs flow into expression builders and plan constructors, which generate ASTs and SQL plans, then produce DataFrames as output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs query plans for grouped data operations, including aggregations, pivoting, and pandas UDFs, using internal expression and AST management functions. It validates user inputs, manages plan nodes, and generates DataFrames. No external communication, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The dynamic expression creation functions are standard for such frameworks and are safeguarded by validation routines. The overall structure aligns with typical internal API implementations for query planning and execution in Snowflake Snowpark.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured internal API component for Snowflake's data processing framework. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are justified and appropriate.",
