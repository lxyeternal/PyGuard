  "purpose": "Setup configuration for building and distributing the snowflake-snowpark-python package, including protobuf compilation and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PROTOC), file system (proto files, version.py), package dependencies (install_requires), and subprocess calls for protoc.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess call to protoc, which could execute external code; potential file manipulations; environment variables influencing execution.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (PROTOC) or system PATH -> subprocess call to protoc -> generation of protobuf code; reading version info -> package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to read version.py; environment variable reliance for protoc; no validation or sanitization of env variables; subprocess invocation directly with external tools.",
  "analysis": "The script reads configuration data, environment variables, and files necessary for setup. It uses exec() unsafely to read version.py, which could execute malicious code if version.py is compromised. Environment variables (PROTOC) influence external command execution without validation, which could lead to command injection if manipulated. The subprocess call to protoc is standard but depends on external tools and environment variables. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code performs protobuf compilation and package setup tasks, which are typical for such scripts. Overall, the code does not contain malicious behavior but relies on external inputs and environment variables that, if compromised, could cause security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a setup script with standard practices, but it uses exec() unsafely and depends on external environment variables without validation, which could be risky if environment manipulation occurs. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The overall security risk is low but warrants caution regarding env variable handling.",
