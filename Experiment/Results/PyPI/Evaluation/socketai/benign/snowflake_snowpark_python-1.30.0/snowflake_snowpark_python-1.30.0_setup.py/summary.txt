  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security considerations are the unsafe exec() call and reliance on environment variables without validation, which could be exploited if the environment or files are compromised. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal but noteworthy potential vulnerabilities."
