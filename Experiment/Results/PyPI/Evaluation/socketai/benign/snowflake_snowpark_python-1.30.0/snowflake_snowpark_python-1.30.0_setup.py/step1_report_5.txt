{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up and configure the Python package 'snowflake-snowpark-python', including dependency management, protobuf code generation, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PROTOC), filesystem (proto files, version file), and external commands (protoc, protoc-gen-mypy).",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess commands for protobuf compilation, writing to stderr and sys.exit calls, and reading environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and file checks determine the flow to generate protobuf files and validate dependencies. External commands (protoc, protoc-gen-mypy) are invoked for code generation, with output files written based on source modification times.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected. Use of environment variables to locate external tools is standard. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation present. All subprocess calls appear legitimate for protobuf code generation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages package setup, including dependency lists, version extraction, and protobuf code generation. It verifies environment variables and file existence before invoking external protobuf compiler commands. There is proper error handling for missing tools. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The subprocess calls are standard for protobuf compilation. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are found.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup script for a Python package involving protobuf code generation. It performs environment checks, external tool invocation, and dependency management in a legitimate manner. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
