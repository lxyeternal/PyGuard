{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up and configure a Python package for Snowflake Snowpark, including dependency management, protobuf code generation, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PROTOC), filesystem (proto files, version.py), and external commands (protoc, protoc-gen-mypy).",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess calls for protoc compilation, writing to stderr for missing dependencies, and sys.exit on critical errors.",
  "flows": "Environment variables/proto files -> generate_proto() -> subprocess.call for protoc -> build process based on generated files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The script performs standard setup procedures. It properly checks for dependencies and handles errors gracefully. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a build and setup script for a Python package. It manages dependencies, generates protobuf bindings, and performs package configuration. It includes environment variable checks for protoc tools and handles their absence with error messages and termination. All subprocess calls are for legitimate protobuf compilation. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as network data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code is structured and uses standard Python packaging practices. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python project, handling protobuf generation and dependency management. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is very low.",
