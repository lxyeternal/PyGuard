  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for protobuf compilation, dependency management, and package metadata for snowflake-snowpark-python.",
  "sources": "Reads version.py via exec(), environment variables (PROTOC), filesystem checks, subprocess calls to protoc and protoc-gen-mypy.",
  "sinks": "External command execution via subprocess, reading version.py with exec(), environment variables influencing command parameters.",
  "flows": "exec() reads version.py -> executes code; environment variables (PROTOC) -> used in subprocess calls; subprocess calls -> generate protobuf files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to read version.py, reliance on environment variables without validation, no input sanitization, standard build process with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard protobuf code generation and package setup. The use of exec() on version.py could execute malicious code if the file is compromised. Environment variables like PROTOC influence subprocess commands and could be manipulated in untrusted environments. No network activity or malicious payloads are present. The subprocess calls are standard for protobuf workflows. Overall, the code is benign but contains typical build script risks due to unsafe exec() and environment variable usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security considerations are the unsafe exec() call and reliance on environment variables without validation, which could be exploited if the environment or files are compromised. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal but noteworthy potential vulnerabilities.",
