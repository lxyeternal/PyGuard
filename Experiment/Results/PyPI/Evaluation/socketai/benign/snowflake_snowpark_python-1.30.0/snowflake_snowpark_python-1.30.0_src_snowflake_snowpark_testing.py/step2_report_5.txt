  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes utility functions for comparing Snowpark DataFrames, using `collect()` and schema attributes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transfer, just local data comparisons.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Uses standard APIs.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, straightforward testing utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar DataFrame comparison utility, with schema and data checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication; diffing is internal.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, standard usage.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, intended for testing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) possibly due to diffing output, but overall benign. No malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, no external data transfer.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Internal data comparison, no external communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, standard pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign testing utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code's function.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, comparing DataFrames.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external I/O.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, testing utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate, no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same, DataFrame comparison.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transfer.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected. The code is purely for testing and validation.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly elevated in some reports (0.1), possibly due to diff output or diff-related info leaks, but nothing malicious.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code operates solely on local data, with no external network, file, or command execution.\n- It uses standard Python libraries and Snowflake APIs.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The diffing and assertion failures are typical for testing utilities and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n### **My Overall Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity or payload detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — The code is a safe, standard testing utility with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign, well-structured testing utility with no security risks or malware. The scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated, with a risk score of zero, reflecting its safe and purpose-specific nature.",
