  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies the code as utility functions for DataFrame comparison, reading data via `collect()` and schema attributes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks or network activity are present.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The code is standard for testing utilities.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that the code is safe and benign is well-supported, with high confidence (1).\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — no security concerns identified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the code compares DataFrames, with data read via `collect()` and schemas.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication; data diffing is internal.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity, secrets, or obfuscation. Use of internal Snowflake APIs is standard.\n- **Potential concern:** Slight mention that converting data to strings could leak data if misused, but within a testing context, this is benign.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that the code is safe and primarily for testing, with a security risk score of 0.1, seems appropriate.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious intent.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward code.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minor, perhaps due to diffing or internal data handling, but overall low.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's role in schema and data comparison.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transmission.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious patterns, no obfuscation, no external calls.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, the code is a benign validation utility.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code compares DataFrames for testing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious code, no obfuscation, no external communication.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a safe utility for testing, with low security risk.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward code.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar to others, correctly identifies the code as a DataFrame comparison utility with no external data leaks or malicious patterns.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious behavior detected.\n- The conclusion that it is safe is justified.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — aligns with the findings.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — no security issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, with a score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports agree on no obfuscation, score 0.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), justified by the internal diffing and data handling, but overall very low.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0.1** (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and well-justified. The code is a standard testing utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and minimal security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate and align with the detailed reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as they are, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The code appears safe and suitable for its intended purpose.",
