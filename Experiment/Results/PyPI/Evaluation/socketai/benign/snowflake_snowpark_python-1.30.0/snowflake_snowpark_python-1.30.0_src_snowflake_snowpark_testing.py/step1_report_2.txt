{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to compare Snowflake Snowpark DataFrames for testing and validation purposes, including schema and data comparison with tolerance for floating-point discrepancies.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from Snowflake DataFrame objects via methods like `collect()` and schema attributes. It also imports internal utilities and types for schema validation.",
  "sinks": "The code converts DataFrames to strings for diffing, which could potentially leak data if misused. It does not contain any network or file operations, nor does it execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from DataFrame objects through their schemas and data rows, into comparison functions where values are compared and diffed. No external or untrusted data sources or sinks are identified beyond internal data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. The code performs standard schema and data validation. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. The code uses internal Snowflake APIs which are not publicly documented here but appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed for data validation in a Snowflake environment, comparing schemas and data rows for equality with options for numerical tolerances. It uses standard Python features and Snowflake SDK components. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of internal utilities is typical for internal tools. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code flows are observed. Overall, this code appears to be safe and intended for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe utility for validating DataFrame equality, focusing on schema and data comparison, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
