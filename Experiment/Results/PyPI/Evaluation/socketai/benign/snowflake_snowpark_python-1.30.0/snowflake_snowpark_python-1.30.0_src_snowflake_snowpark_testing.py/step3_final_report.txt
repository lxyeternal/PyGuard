  "purpose": "Utility functions for comparing Snowpark DataFrames, including schema validation and data equality checks, primarily for testing and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Data is collected via the 'collect()' method from DataFrames, and schema attributes are accessed directly.",
  "sinks": "No external data transfer; all comparisons and data handling occur within the local environment.",
  "flows": "Data from DataFrames is collected into Python lists of Rows, then sorted and compared; schema attributes are directly accessed for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of string diffing could potentially leak data if misused outside controlled environments, but within testing, this is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs schema and data comparisons for DataFrames, using standard Python libraries and Snowflake APIs. It sorts data for order-insensitive comparison and provides detailed assertion errors with diffs. No external communication, obfuscation, or malicious behavior identified. The functions are typical for testing utilities, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard testing utility for Snowpark DataFrames, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk score reflects the internal diffing process, which is safe within controlled testing environments.",
