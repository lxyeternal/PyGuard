{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for comparing Snowpark DataFrames and schemas for testing and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads static imported modules, function parameters (DataFrame objects, schemas, and tolerance values), and local variables such as rows and schemas.",
  "sinks": "The code converts DataFrames to lists of Rows, compares schemas and data, and raises AssertionError on mismatches. No external data is fetched or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrames are collected into lists, sorted, and then compared element-wise. Schema comparison is done directly between schema objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external network communication. Use of assert statements is for testing purposes only.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard data comparison techniques for testing DataFrame equality, including schema validation and data value comparison with tolerances. It does not perform any data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code's structure and logic are straightforward and aligned with testing utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of DataFrame comparison utilities intended for testing and validation, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It solely performs data/schema validation for Snowpark DataFrames, providing detailed assertion errors for mismatches. No security risks or malicious behaviors are evident.",
