  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard testing utility for Snowpark DataFrames, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk score reflects the internal diffing process, which is safe within controlled testing environments."
