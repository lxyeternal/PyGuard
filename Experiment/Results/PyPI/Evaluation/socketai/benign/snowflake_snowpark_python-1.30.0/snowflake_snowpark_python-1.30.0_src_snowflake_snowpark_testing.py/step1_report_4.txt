{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for asserting equality between Snowpark DataFrames and their schemas, primarily for testing and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from DataFrame objects via methods like `collect()` and accesses schema attributes like `schema` and `fields`. No external or untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data leading to data leaks, system commands, or external communication. The code raises assertions and exceptions locally, which are not malicious behaviors.",
  "flows": "Data flows from DataFrame objects through collection and schema comparison functions, with no data transmitted over networks or external channels.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for data validation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, external network connections, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python constructs, type checks, assertions, and data comparisons for validating DataFrame schemas and content. It employs safe comparison practices, including floating-point tolerance handling, and does not perform any dynamic code execution or external system interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. It strictly operates on provided DataFrame objects and raises exceptions on mismatches, consistent with its testing utility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for testing and validating Snowpark DataFrames, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behaviors. It does not contain obfuscated or suspicious code, nor does it perform any harmful operations. The security risk score is low, and malware likelihood is negligible.",
