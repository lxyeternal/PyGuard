{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a compatibility layer for the ziPython package, redirecting users to the updated 'zhinst.core' module and issuing a deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'zhinst.core' and the '__version__' attribute, as well as the warnings.warn() call.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn() outputs to standard error; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'zhinst.core' -> access to '__version__' -> issuing of deprecation warning.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs straightforward deprecation handling with standard import and warning functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all from 'zhinst.core' to maintain compatibility. It also imports '__version__' for potential version checks. The warnings.warn() notifies users of the renaming from 'ziPython' to 'zhinst.core'. There is no user input handling, no data manipulation, or external network communication. The code is simple and standard for deprecation management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility shim with no malicious behavior. Its purpose is to notify users of the package rename and facilitate migration. There are no security risks or suspicious activities present.",
