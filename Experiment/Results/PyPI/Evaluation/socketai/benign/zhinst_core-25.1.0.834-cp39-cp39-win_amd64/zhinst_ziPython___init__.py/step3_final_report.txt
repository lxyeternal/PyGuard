  "purpose": "Compatibility layer to inform users of module renaming and facilitate migration from ziPython to zhinst.core.",
  "sources": "Importing all symbols from zhinst.core and importing __version__",
  "sinks": "Deprecation warning output",
  "flows": "Import statements and warning issuance",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (`from zhinst.core import *`), which can cause namespace pollution but is common in compatibility modules",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility shim that imports everything from zhinst.core, issues a deprecation warning, and imports __version__. No malicious payloads, network activity, or data leaks are present. The wildcard import is a known pattern in such contexts but not a security risk. The warning is standard and benign. No obfuscation or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is 0, all consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard deprecation shim with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports correctly identify its purpose and security posture. The scores are appropriate; minor namespace pollution does not constitute a security risk.",
