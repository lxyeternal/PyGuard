{
  "purpose": "To provide a deprecated compatibility layer for the ziPython package, redirecting users to the zhinst.core module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from zhinst.core and the version attribute from zhinst.core",
  "sinks": "Warnings function which outputs a deprecation warning",
  "flows": "Importing everything from zhinst.core, then issuing a warning to users about the package rename",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) from zhinst.core, which can obscure the origin of imported symbols; deprecation warning is standard and benign",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from zhinst.core, which can introduce namespace pollution, but this is a common pattern for compatibility layers. It also retrieves a version attribute. The code then issues a deprecation warning informing users of the renaming. There are no suspicious or malicious operations, no data leaks, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network activity. The code appears to be purely for maintaining backward compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deprecation and compatibility layer without malicious intent. It aims to ease migration from an older package structure to a new one. No security issues or malicious behavior detected.",
