  "purpose": "Provide a compatibility layer for deprecated ziPython package, guiding users to the new zhinst.core module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from zhinst.core and the warnings module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Imports from zhinst.core are straightforward; warning message is issued upon module load.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; the code is standard deprecation handling.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a deprecation warning indicating that 'ziPython' has been renamed and instructs users to update their imports. It imports everything from 'zhinst.core' to maintain compatibility, which is a common practice during deprecation periods. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The use of warnings.warn is standard and does not pose security risks. No hardcoded credentials, data leakage, or malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module serves as a deprecation wrapper to inform users of the renaming and maintain compatibility. It is a benign, standard implementation with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
