  "flows": "The code imports modules and triggers a deprecation warning; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, serving as a simple deprecation shim.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, including 'warnings' and 'zhinst.core'. It issues a deprecation warning advising users to update their import statements. The code is standard for backward compatibility and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The only noteworthy feature is the deprecation warning, which is standard practice.",
