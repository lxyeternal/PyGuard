{
  "purpose": "This module acts as a compatibility layer to redirect deprecated imports to the new 'zhinst.core' module, facilitating migration for users.",
  "sources": "Import statements, specifically 'from zhinst.core import *' and 'from zhinst.core import __version__'",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data outputs or system modifications are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily issues a warning",
  "anomalies": "Uses a wildcard import which can obscure specific imported functions or variables, but this is common in compatibility layers; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from 'zhinst.core', issues a deprecation warning to inform users of the module rename, and does not execute any other logic. The warning promotes user awareness but does not affect system integrity or security. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code injection. The wildcard import is a potential source of namespace pollution but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a deprecation shim to guide users towards the new module. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of a warning indicates good practice for transition management but does not raise security concerns.",
