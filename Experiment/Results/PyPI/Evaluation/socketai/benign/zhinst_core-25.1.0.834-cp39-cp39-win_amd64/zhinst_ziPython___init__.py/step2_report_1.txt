  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a compatibility layer that imports from `zhinst.core` and issues a deprecation warning.\n- No reports mention any suspicious behavior, malicious code, or data leaks.\n- The code's primary function is to ease migration from an old module (`ziPython`) to the new one (`zhinst.core`).\n- Use of wildcard import (`from zhinst.core import *`) is noted, which can cause namespace pollution but is common in compatibility modules.\n- No evidence of external network activity, hardcoded secrets, or code obfuscation.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain malicious code or security vulnerabilities.\n- The use of wildcard import could be considered a best practice violation but is not inherently insecure.\n- The deprecation warning is standard and benign.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The reports correctly identify the purpose and behavior of the code.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or very low (e.g., 0.1), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code only imports modules and issues a warning, the risk is minimal.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent or security vulnerability.\n- The only concern might be the wildcard import, but this is a common pattern in compatibility modules and not a security risk.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- Report 4 assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1, which is slightly higher than others. Given the analysis, this is probably an overestimate. The code is benign, so `securityRisk` should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify that this code is a benign compatibility shim with no security issues. The only minor point is the wildcard import, which is acceptable in this context. The deprecation warning is standard practice and does not introduce security concerns.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the nature of the code.",
