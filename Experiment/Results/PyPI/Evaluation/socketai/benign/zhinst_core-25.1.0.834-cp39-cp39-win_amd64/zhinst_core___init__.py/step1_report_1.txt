{
  "purpose": "The code imports everything from the _core module and exposes its documentation, version, and commit hash, potentially to define the public API of this package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._core and attribute accesses on _core (e.g., __doc__, __version__, __commit_hash__, __all__)",
  "sinks": "Accessing attributes from _core; no untrusted data handling or output operations observed",
  "flows": "Import from _core; attribute assignments from _core to module namespace; conditional assignment of __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and primarily acts as a wrapper or proxy for _core.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a relative module _core, then assigns documentation, version, and commit hash information from _core to the current module's namespace. If _core defines __all__, it is propagated to the current module. The code performs no data processing, user input handling, network activity, or other suspicious behaviors. It appears to serve as a simple API surface layer.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module wrapper that re-exports attributes from _core without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. No security risks are identified.",
