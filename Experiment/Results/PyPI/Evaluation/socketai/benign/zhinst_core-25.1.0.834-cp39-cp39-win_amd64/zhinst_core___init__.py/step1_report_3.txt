{
  "purpose": "This code acts as a wrapper or interface that imports everything from a module named _core and exposes its documentation, version, commit hash, and all public attributes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._core, accessing attributes such as __doc__, __version__, __commit_hash__, and __all__ from _core",
  "sinks": "No evident sink for untrusted data or external communication; no external inputs or network operations are present",
  "flows": "The code imports data from _core and re-exposes certain attributes; there are no data flows leading to external outputs or untrusted sinks",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual constructs. It relies entirely on the _core module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from a local module _core, then assigns its __doc__, __version__, and __commit_hash__ attributes to the current namespace, and conditionally copies __all__ if it exists. There are no malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden code. The import is standard, and the code appears to serve as an interface or initialization script. Since it depends on _core, its security depends on the integrity of that module; this script itself does not introduce malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple wrapper that exposes certain attributes from _core. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no evident security issues. Its security assessment is high confidence that it is benign.",
