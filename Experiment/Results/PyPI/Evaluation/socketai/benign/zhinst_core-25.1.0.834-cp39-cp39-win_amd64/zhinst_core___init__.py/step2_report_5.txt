  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the validity of their conclusions, the appropriateness of their scores, and any potential overlooked risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward wrapper re-exporting attributes from `_core`. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware is detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code is simple, transparent, and does not perform any malicious actions. The high confidence and zero scores are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a benign interface exposing attributes from `_core`. No anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is straightforward, and no suspicious activity is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Re-exports attributes from `_core`, no malicious behavior, standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these scores.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Uses `import *` to re-export `_core` symbols, which can be risky but is common. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The only concern here is the use of `import *`, which can obscure what is imported and potentially introduce conflicts or hidden behaviors. While this is a known pattern, it warrants a slight increase in security risk score. The malware score remains zero, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- **securityRisk:** Increase from 0.1 to **0.2** to reflect the caution warranted by wildcard imports.  \n- **confidence:** Keep at 0.9, as the analysis remains valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with `import *` and re-exporting attributes. No malicious activity observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The use of `import *` again is noted, but without evidence of malicious intent. The risk score could be slightly increased due to this pattern.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- **securityRisk:** Increase from 0 to **0.1** to acknowledge the potential risk associated with wildcard imports.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and not malicious.\n- The primary concern is the use of `import *`, which, while common, can be risky or lead to ambiguity.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present in any report.\n\n### Final Estimated Scores (My assessment):\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** Considering the use of `import *`, I would assign a **risk score of 0.2**. The code itself is benign, but the pattern warrants cautiousness.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a simple, transparent module wrapper with no malicious intent. The only minor concern is the use of `import *`, which should be flagged with a slight increase in the security risk score. No malware or obfuscation is evident, and the overall security posture remains very high.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware=0, obfuscated=0.  \n- Set securityRisk=0.2.  \n- Keep confidence at 1, as the analysis is straightforward and accurate.",
