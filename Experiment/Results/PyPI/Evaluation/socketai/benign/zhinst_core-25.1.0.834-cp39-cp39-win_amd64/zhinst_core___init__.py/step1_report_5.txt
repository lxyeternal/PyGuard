{
  "purpose": "The code imports all attributes from a local module named '_core' and exposes some of its metadata (docstring, version, commit hash, and possibly __all__).",
  "sources": "Import statement: from ._core import *",
  "sinks": "Potential exposure of all attributes from _core via import *, but no direct data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imported _core contents are assigned to current module's namespace; metadata attributes are read from _core.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from ._core import *' can obscure which attributes are imported, but this is a common pattern for exposing internal modules. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily re-exports attributes from the _core module, and conditionally exposes __all__ if _core defines it. No untrusted input, network operations, or code execution found. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only noteworthy aspect is the wildcard import, which can reduce clarity but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears to be a straightforward module that re-exports content from _core, possibly as part of a package's public API. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
