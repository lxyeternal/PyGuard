{
  "purpose": "A simple module wrapper that imports all symbols from the internal '_core' module and re-exports specific attributes for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports symbols from a local module '_core'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication; no data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports symbols from '_core' and assigns certain attributes to the module namespace; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported symbols and potentially cause conflicts, but is a common pattern in re-export modules. No malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward re-export pattern that imports everything from a local '_core' module and exposes some of its attributes at the package level. No data processing, user input, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The use of 'import *' is noted but is typical in such re-export modules and does not imply malicious intent. The security of this code depends on the trustworthiness of '_core', which is assumed to be safe. No obfuscation, malicious code, or anomalies are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate, with a slight increase to 0.2 to account for the potential risks associated with 'import *'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and does not pose security risks. The use of 'import *' is a minor concern but not malicious. The scores reflect a very low security risk, and no modifications are necessary.",
