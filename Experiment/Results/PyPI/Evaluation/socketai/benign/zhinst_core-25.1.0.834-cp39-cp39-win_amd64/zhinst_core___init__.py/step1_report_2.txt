{
  "purpose": "This code acts as a wrapper or interface that imports all contents from the _core module and exposes certain attributes such as documentation, version, commit hash, and __all__ if available.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._core, accessing _core's __doc__, __version__, __commit_hash__, and __all__ attributes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is sent to external sources, network, or storage.",
  "flows": "Reads from _core module attributes and exposes them as module-level variables; no external data flow or untrusted input handling detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a module named _core and assigns its documentation, version, commit hash, and possibly __all__ attribute to the current module's namespace. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. The presence of attributes like __commit_hash__ may suggest version control tracking, but their usage here is straightforward. No signs of malicious activity, code injection, or obfuscation are present. It functions as a standard module proxy or wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module interface that exposes certain attributes from the _core module. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a typical pattern for packaging or module management.",
