  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning regarding the package name change from zhinst.ziPython to zhinst.core.",
  "sources": "The import statement importing everything from zhinst.core.errors",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn function, which outputs a deprecation warning message",
  "flows": "Import from zhinst.core.errors -> triggers warnings.warn -> outputs deprecation message",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from the zhinst.core.errors module, then issues a DeprecationWarning indicating that the package has been renamed. The warning message is straightforward and does not contain dynamic code execution or malicious indicators. There are no suspicious data flows, no external network activity, and no sensitive data handling. The import statement is standard and benign. The code's sole purpose appears to be informing users of the package rename.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deprecation notice and import statement with no malicious intent. It poses no security risks and is consistent with common warning practices. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
