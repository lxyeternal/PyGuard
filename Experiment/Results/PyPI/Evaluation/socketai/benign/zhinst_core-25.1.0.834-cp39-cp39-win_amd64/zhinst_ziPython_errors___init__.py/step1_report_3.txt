  "purpose": "To issue a deprecation warning regarding the renaming of the zhinst.ziPython package to zhinst.core.",
  "sources": "The import statement importing everything from zhinst.core.errors",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn function which outputs a deprecation warning message",
  "flows": "Importing errors from zhinst.core (source) leads to a warning being issued (sink)",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*') from a package, which can obscure the exact imported components; no other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from zhinst.core.errors, which is a common practice but can lead to namespace pollution. The warnings.warn function is used properly to emit a deprecation message regarding package renaming. No malicious code or unusual behavior is present. The code is straightforward and intended for user notification.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves a benign purpose: issuing a deprecation warning for a package rename. No malicious activity or security issues are detected. The use of wildcard import is a potential concern for code clarity but not malicious.",
