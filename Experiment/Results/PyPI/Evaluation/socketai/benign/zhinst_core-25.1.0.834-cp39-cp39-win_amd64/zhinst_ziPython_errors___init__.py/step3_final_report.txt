  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import and issues a deprecation warning. No data is processed, no external communication occurs, and no malicious or obfuscated code is present. The wildcard import is a style concern but not malicious. The code's purpose is benign, serving solely as a user notification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or security risks. The only minor concern is the wildcard import, which does not impact security but is discouraged for best practices. Overall, the code poses no threat.",
