  "purpose": "Issue a deprecation warning for outdated import usage of the zhinst.ziPython package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'warnings' module to issue a warning and from 'zhinst.core.errors' to import all errors.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external data sources or untrusted inputs; it only issues a warning internally.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process untrusted input data, nor does it send data externally.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with standard warning and import statements; no unusual or suspicious code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the warnings module and suppresses deprecation warnings related to a package rename. It imports all errors from 'zhinst.core.errors'. The warning message is standard for deprecation notices and does not perform any malicious action. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious data flow. The import is standard, and the warning is informational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to notify users of a package renaming through a deprecation warning. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
