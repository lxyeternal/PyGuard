  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: importing error classes from `zhinst.core.errors` and issuing a deprecation warning about renaming from `zhinst.ziPython` to `zhinst.core`.\n- No data processing, user input, external communication, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code is straightforward, serving solely as a notification mechanism.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Deprecation warning about package renaming.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected. The code is benign.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same purpose.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import (`from zhinst.core.errors import *`) noted as a potential concern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.9 (originally), confidence=0.9.\n- **Analysis:** While wildcard imports can lead to namespace pollution, they are not inherently malicious. The high securityRisk score (0.9) seems unjustified, given the benign nature of the code. The malware score remains at 0, which is correct.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce `securityRisk` from 0.9 to 0.1 or 0, as no security concern exists here. The `malware` score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same purpose.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same purpose.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Justification**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk Score:** For the reports that assign a high score (like 0.9 in Report 3), this is unjustified given the benign code. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network activity, or handle sensitive info. Wildcard import, while discouraged, is not malicious.\n- **Confidence:** Mostly 1, which is appropriate, except for Report 3, which should be higher (closer to 1) after correction.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n- **Security Risk Score:** Should be 0 or very close to 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** No evidence.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0 (since the code is purely informational and contains no security concerns)\n\nThis code is a standard deprecation warning with no security issues. The scores should reflect that, with particular attention to lowering any unjustified high security risk scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are generally accurate in identifying the benign nature of the code. The only correction needed is to adjust the `securityRisk` score in Report 3 from 0.9 to 0, aligning with the code's actual risk profile.",
