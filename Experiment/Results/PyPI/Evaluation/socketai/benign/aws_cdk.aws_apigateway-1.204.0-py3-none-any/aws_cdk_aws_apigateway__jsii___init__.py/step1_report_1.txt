{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up and load AWS CDK modules for infrastructure deployment, with no explicit operational logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party libraries (jsii, publication, typeguard), and numerous AWS CDK modules via _jsii. The only active code is the jsii assembly loading and a publish call.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Imports and assembly load flow from module definitions to initialization, with no data flow involving untrusted sources or sensitive information.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual usage of __jsii_assembly__ as a module-level variable, and the publish() call at the end. The code is mainly initialization and setup, which is typical for CDK constructs, not suspicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports AWS CDK modules and loads a JSII assembly for AWS API Gateway version 1.204.0. It then assigns this assembly to a variable and publishes metadata via publication.publish(). There are no data inputs, network calls, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be part of an infrastructure-as-code setup, not malware or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for AWS CDK infrastructure components, involving module imports and assembly loading. It contains no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It is safe and typical for infrastructure deployment scripts.",
