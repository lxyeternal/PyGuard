  "purpose": "Load a specific AWS CDK JSII assembly for API Gateway and publish metadata.",
  "sources": "Assembly file 'aws-apigateway@1.204.0.jsii.tgz' loaded via jsii.JSIIAssembly.load()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration points present",
  "flows": "Assembly load from file; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Loading external assembly file without visible verification; no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and AWS CDK modules, loads a versioned assembly file, and calls publish(). No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious patterns are detected. The assembly load from a fixed filename suggests controlled dependency management. The only potential concern is supply chain risk if the assembly source is compromised, but no evidence of tampering or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical infrastructure setup script with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The assembly load introduces a minor supply chain risk if the assembly integrity isn't verified, but this is standard practice in managed environments. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score is slightly elevated to 0.2 due to external assembly loading without verification.",
