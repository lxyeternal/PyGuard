      "conclusion": "The code is a typical infrastructure setup script with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The assembly load introduces a minor supply chain risk if the assembly integrity isn't verified, but this is standard practice in managed environments. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score is slightly elevated to 0.2 due to external assembly loading without verification."
