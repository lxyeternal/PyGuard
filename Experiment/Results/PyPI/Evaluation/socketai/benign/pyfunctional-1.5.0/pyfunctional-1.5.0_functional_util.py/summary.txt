  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions with a significant security concern related to 'dill' deserialization. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The main risk is the potential for arbitrary code execution during deserialization of untrusted data. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a moderate to high security risk if used improperly. Proper validation, sandboxing, or avoiding deserialization of untrusted data is recommended to mitigate this risk."
