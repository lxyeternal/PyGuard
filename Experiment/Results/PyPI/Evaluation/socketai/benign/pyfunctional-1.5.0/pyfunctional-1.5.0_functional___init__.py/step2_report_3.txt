  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a minimal module with package metadata and imports `seq` and `pseq` from `functional.streams`.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns is observed in the code snippets.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly noting the benign nature of the code.\n- They emphasize the absence of data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution, which is appropriate.\n- No logical flaws or inaccuracies are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security risk: 0\n\n- These scores seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code snippet.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since all evidence points to a simple, metadata, and import statement with no malicious activity, risk scores above 0.5 are unwarranted.\n- The malware score is 0, aligning with the lack of malicious indicators.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any claims based on assumptions**\n\n- All claims are based on observable code; no assumptions are made about the contents of `functional.streams`.\n- The reports correctly refrain from assuming malicious intent without evidence.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure score consistency**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward module with metadata and safe imports. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The package appears benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign. No changes are necessary. The overall security assessment confirms that this code snippet does not pose any security threat.",
