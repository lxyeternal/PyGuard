  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code contains only package metadata variables and an import statement from `functional.streams`.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, dynamic code execution, or network activities.\n   - The import of `seq` and `pseq` appears straightforward.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - No issues, anomalies, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are evident.\n   - The code seems benign and typical for a package's core module.\n\n3. **Score Justification**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1), indicating certainty in the benign assessment.\n   - Given the absence of any suspicious activity, these scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores**:\n   - Since no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present, scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate.\n   - The code is purely metadata and import statements, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:\n   - The only possible concern could be the trustworthiness of the `functional.streams` module. If that module were malicious, importing from it could be risky.\n   - However, based solely on this fragment, there's no indication of malicious code or suspicious behavior within the snippet itself.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - All reports are consistent in their benign assessment.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are evident.\n\n**Final Evaluation**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional Notes**:\n- If further context reveals that `functional.streams` is malicious or compromised, the risk assessment might change.\n- As it stands, this code fragment is safe and standard.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code snippet. No changes are necessary.",
