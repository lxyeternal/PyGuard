  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code contains only package metadata variables (__author__, __license__, etc.) and an import statement:\n     ```python\n     from functional.streams import seq, pseq\n     ```\n   - There is no data processing, user input, network activity, or code execution beyond the import.\n   - The import points to a module `functional.streams`, which is presumably a third-party or open-source package.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The code appears straightforward and typical for a package's core module or setup.\n   - The import statement itself is benign; it does not execute code or handle untrusted data in this snippet.\n   - The package metadata is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - The overall confidence is high (1), which aligns with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions:**\n   - The only potential concern would be if the imported module `functional.streams` were malicious. However, this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.\n   - Since no malicious behavior is observed or implied, the risk scores remain at zero.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a standard module header with imports, with no signs of malicious activity.\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a benign, straightforward module with no malicious or suspicious elements. The import is from a presumably legitimate library, and no dynamic or sensitive operations are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet. No adjustments to scores are necessary. The code appears safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
