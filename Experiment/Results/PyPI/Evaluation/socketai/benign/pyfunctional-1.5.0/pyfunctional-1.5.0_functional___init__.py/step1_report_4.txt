{
  "purpose": "The code provides metadata and imports functions for creating data pipelines and performing LINQ-style data analysis and functional programming.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'functional.streams', specifically 'seq' and 'pseq'",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks",
  "flows": "Import statements load functions from a third-party library; no data flows from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains metadata definitions (__author__, __license__, etc.) and an import statement. The import is from a presumably third-party library 'functional.streams', importing 'seq' and 'pseq'. There are no inputs, data processing, or runtime behaviors that could be malicious. The code appears straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple package metadata and import declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is standard and does not include any suspicious or malicious elements.",
