{
  "purpose": "This package provides data pipeline creation, LINQ-style data analysis, and functional programming utilities, primarily through the imports of streams.seq and streams.pseq.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions 'seq' and 'pseq' from the 'functional.streams' module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports external functions which could be used elsewhere in the package; no data flows are visible in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of package metadata and an import statement from a seemingly legitimate library. There are no inputs, no processing, and no outputs or data handling present here. The import is straightforward, and no untrusted data sources or suspicious code behaviors are apparent. The package metadata indicates standard licensing and versioning without any anomalies. The only code action is an import statement, which appears to be part of normal package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package module header with an import statement and metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no suspicious code patterns, and no security risks identified in this fragment.",
