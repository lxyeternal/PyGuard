{
  "purpose": "The code provides package metadata and imports for a data processing library focused on data pipelines and functional programming.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata from module-level variables and imports from the 'functional.streams' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks or places where untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "The only flow involves importing functions 'seq' and 'pseq' from 'functional.streams' without further data handling in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present. The import appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily package metadata and a simple import statement. It does not include data input, user interaction, network activity, or any dynamic code execution. The import of 'seq' and 'pseq' could be used elsewhere for data processing but does not itself introduce malicious behavior. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign, serving as part of a package's setup or core module, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
