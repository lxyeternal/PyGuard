{
  "purpose": "The code provides a package-level description and imports core modules for data pipelines and data analysis functionalities, specifically importing 'seq' and 'pseq' from 'functional.streams'.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata variables (__author__, __copyright__, __license__, __version__, __maintainer__, __email__, __status__) and imports from 'functional.streams'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no untrusted data outputs or network operations.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to the import statement and the setting of module metadata variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The imported module 'functional.streams' might contain complex logic, but this cannot be determined from this fragment alone.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple module metadata definitions and a straightforward import statement. There are no indications of malicious activity or suspicious behavior. The import is from a presumably open-source 'functional.streams' module, which is common in data processing packages. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or network activity are present. The code appears benign and standard for a package's main module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with metadata and module import. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. Based solely on this fragment, the code appears safe.",
