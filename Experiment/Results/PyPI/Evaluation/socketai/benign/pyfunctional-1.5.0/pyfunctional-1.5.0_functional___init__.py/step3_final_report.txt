  "purpose": "Package for creating data pipelines, LINQ-style data analysis, and functional programming. Imports the primary entrypoint at streams.seq",
  "sources": "Import from functional.streams module",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "None",
  "analysis": "The code contains only package metadata variables and a straightforward import statement from 'functional.streams'. There are no data inputs, outputs, dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The import appears standard and benign. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this minimal code snippet, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the analysis. The trustworthiness of the imported module cannot be confirmed from this snippet alone, but there is no evidence of malicious intent within the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module with package metadata and a simple import statement. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
