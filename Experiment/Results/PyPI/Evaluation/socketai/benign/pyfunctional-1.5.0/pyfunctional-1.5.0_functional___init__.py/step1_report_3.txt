{
  "purpose": "To provide functionality for creating data pipelines, LINQ-style data analysis, and functional programming using imports from 'functional.streams'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'functional.streams' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "The imported 'seq' and 'pseq' are intended for use in data processing pipelines, but no data flow is present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. Metadata such as author, license, version, and contact info is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from an external module without executing any code or processing data. No input handling, data output, or dynamic execution occurs here. The metadata appears legitimate, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The import itself is benign, assuming the 'functional' package is trustworthy.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward module initialization with standard metadata and safe imports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a normal component of a data processing library.",
