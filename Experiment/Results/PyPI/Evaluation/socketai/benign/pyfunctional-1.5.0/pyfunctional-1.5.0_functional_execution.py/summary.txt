  "conclusion": "The code is a benign sequence transformation framework with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The primary security concern relates to external functions and user-defined transformations, which are outside the scope of this snippet. Scores are consistent with the analysis: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use, provided external dependencies are trusted."
