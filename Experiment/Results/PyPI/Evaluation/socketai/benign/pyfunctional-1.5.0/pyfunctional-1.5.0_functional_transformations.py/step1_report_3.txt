{
  "purpose": "The code provides a collection of functional transformation utilities for sequences, such as map, filter, reduce, join, and others, to facilitate data processing in a functional style.",
  "sources": "The code reads function parameters (inputs to transformation functions), sequence arguments, and internal variables such as sequence data and function outputs.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous sinks include use of eval or exec (not present here), network operations, file I/O, or system calls. No such operations are evident. Also, there are no direct untrusted data outputs or external resource interactions.",
  "flows": "Input sequences and functions are passed into transformation functions, which produce transformed sequences or data structures. No external data or system interaction flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are evident. All functions perform standard sequence transformations using Python's itertools, collections, and functional programming patterns. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious behavior is detectable.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive library of sequence transformation functions implemented in a clear, modular manner. It uses standard Python features and idioms, with no signs of malicious payloads or suspicious data handling. No network operations, system modifications, or secret handling are present. The code appears intended for legitimate data processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of sequence transformation utilities with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It seems safe and purposefully designed for functional data processing, without malicious intent or security risks.",
