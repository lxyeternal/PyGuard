  "purpose": "A collection of sequence transformation utilities, including map, filter, sort, group, and join operations, designed to process sequences in a functional style.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, input sequences, and internally generated iterators.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed internally within functions and generators.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sequences through transformation functions, with no external data or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard sequence transformation functions using Python's itertools, collections, and functional programming idioms. It employs 'partial' to create function wrappers, which is typical in functional utilities. No external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and do not perform any unsafe operations. The use of 'partial' and higher-order functions could theoretically be misused if combined with malicious functions, but as-is, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured sequence transformation library with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 to reflect minimal potential misuse if combined with malicious functions, but in its current form, it is safe.",
