  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some data processing or computation, potentially involving external data sources or user input.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, input functions, or external files (exact sources not visible in the provided snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, prints to console, or sends data over network connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input or environment variables) through processing functions to sinks such as output or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. No cryptic variable names or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform standard data processing without any signs of malicious behavior. No malicious side-effects, such as system damage, data exfiltration, or network connections to suspicious domains, are evident. The structure is straightforward, and usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code snippets are visible. The code's intent seems benign based on the visible logic.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The code appears to be a typical data processing script with no suspicious behaviors. The security risk is minimal, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
