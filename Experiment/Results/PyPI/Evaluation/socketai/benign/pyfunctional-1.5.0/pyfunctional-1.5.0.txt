The primary security concern relates to external functions and user-defined transformations, which are outside the scope of this snippet. Scores are consistent with the analysis: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use, provided external dependencies are trusted."

      "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions with a significant security concern related to 'dill' deserialization. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The main risk is the potential for arbitrary code execution during deserialization of untrusted data. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a moderate to high security risk if used improperly. Proper validation, sandboxing, or avoiding deserialization of untrusted data is recommended to mitigate this risk."

The extension mechanism is a flexible API pattern that does not introduce inherent risks, assuming trusted functions are used. Overall, the security assessment is justified and the code is safe for use."
