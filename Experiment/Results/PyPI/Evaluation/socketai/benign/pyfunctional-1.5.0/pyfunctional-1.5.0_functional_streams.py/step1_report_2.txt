{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for creating and manipulating data streams, including reading files in various formats, querying databases, and enabling parallel processing.",
  "sources": "File input functions (open, csv, json, jsonl, sqlite3), and data inputs from method parameters such as file paths, database connections, and iterables.",
  "sinks": "Data is returned as sequences for further processing; no direct output sinks are present, but the code allows for data flow from input sources to sequences.",
  "flows": "Input sources (file paths, database connections, iterables) flow into reading/parsing functions, which then output sequences for downstream use.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard data reading and parsing without unusual code, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for data ingestion and processing, including reading files, CSV, JSON, JSONL, and SQLite data, and creating data sequences. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or hidden behavior is observed. It uses well-known libraries and practices for data handling, with proper input validation. No hardcoded credentials or network activity are present. The use of third-party libraries is standard, and the code structure is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data processing utility for sequence generation from various input sources. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears to serve legitimate data ingestion purposes without any suspicious features.",
