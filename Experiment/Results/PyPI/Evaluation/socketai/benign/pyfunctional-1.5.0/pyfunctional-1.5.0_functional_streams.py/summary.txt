  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard data processing utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low risk score (~0.1-0.2) accurately reflects minimal inherent security concerns. Overall, the reports are justified, and no modifications are necessary."
