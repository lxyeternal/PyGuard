  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'liac-arff' Python package, facilitating package installation, metadata, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long description; importing modules; defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data affects system security or leaks.",
  "flows": "Reading file to set 'long_description' (source) during setup configuration (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling ('except:'), which could mask issues but is not inherently malicious; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package: importing setuptools, handling missing dependencies, reading a README file for description, and defining package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data is present. The exception handling is broad but not malicious; it simply defaults 'long_description' to empty if file reading fails. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical, benign Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
