  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'liac-arff' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, version info, and README file content; imports modules for setup and installation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no user input or external untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reads version, author info, and README file content during setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. Use of standard setup procedures and safe imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script using setuptools, with fallback import for ez_setup. It reads static package metadata, author info, and README content. No dynamic code execution, no untrusted inputs, no network activity, or obfuscated code. The use of try-except blocks is standard for handling optional dependencies and file reading. The script appears to be standard boilerplate for packaging a Python module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks safely.",
