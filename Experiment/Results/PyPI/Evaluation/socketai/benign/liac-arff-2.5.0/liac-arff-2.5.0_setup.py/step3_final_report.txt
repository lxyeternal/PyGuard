  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'liac-arff' Python module.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, author info, and README file; imports setuptools or ez_setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads README file, then calls setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated 'rU' mode for Python 2; broad exception handling when reading README.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, benign setup.py script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The use of 'rU' mode is outdated but harmless. The broad exception handling masks potential errors but is common in setup scripts and does not introduce security risks. No obfuscation, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe package configuration file with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The minor anomaly of broad exception handling is acceptable and does not impact security.",
