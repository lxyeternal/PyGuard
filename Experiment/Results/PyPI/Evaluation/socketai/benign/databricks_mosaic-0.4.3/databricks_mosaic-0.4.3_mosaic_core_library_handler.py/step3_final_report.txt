  "purpose": "Manage and attach Mosaic JAR dependencies into a Spark/Databricks environment, utilizing configuration properties and resource fallback mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Configuration properties ('spark.databricks.labs.mosaic.jar.path', 'spark.databricks.labs.mosaic.jar.autoattach'), importlib.metadata, importlib.resources, JVM objects for URI and library registration.",
  "sinks": "JVM calls for creating URIs, registering libraries, and attaching dependencies to Spark context.",
  "flows": "Configuration reading → resource path resolution → JVM URI creation → library object construction → library registration and attachment via JVM context.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad try-except blocks which may mask underlying errors; reliance on resource files that could be manipulated if package contents are compromised, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dependency management tasks in Spark/Databricks, accessing configuration and resources securely and interacting with JVM APIs as expected. No suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. Exception handling is broad but typical for resource fallback. The resource access via importlib and importlib.metadata is legitimate. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing dependencies in Spark/Databricks, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and the code's behavior aligns with standard practices. No modifications are necessary.",
