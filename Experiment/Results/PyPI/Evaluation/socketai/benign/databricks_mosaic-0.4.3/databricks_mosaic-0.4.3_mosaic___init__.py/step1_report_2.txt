{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules and functions, likely setting up a package or library for spatial data processing or visualization.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .api, .core, .models, .readers, .utils.display_handler",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or exfiltrated",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow is visible in this snippet; however, imported functions and classes could be used elsewhere to process data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "This code solely consists of import statements and a version identifier. It imports various components, possibly for further data processing or visualization. There are no dynamic code execution, network calls, or other suspicious behaviors. The module structure appears standard for a Python package. Since no additional logic, input handling, or data processing is included, the code itself does not pose an immediate security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module import setup for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
