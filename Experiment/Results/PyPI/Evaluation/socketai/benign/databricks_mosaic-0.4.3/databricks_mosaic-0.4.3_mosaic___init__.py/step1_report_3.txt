  "purpose": "Import various modules and functions for a Python package, setting the package version.",
  "sources": "Module imports from relative paths: .api, .core, .models, .readers, .utils.display_handler",
  "sinks": "No sinks of untrusted data or potential vulnerabilities; purely import statements",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; imports do not execute untrusted code or handle data directly",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) from .api can be risky as it imports all contents without explicit control; otherwise, no anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic import statements from local modules within the package. The wildcard import from .api may import unintended or malicious code if the source is compromised, but on its own, it is a common pattern in package initialization. No code execution, data handling, or network activity is present. The version string is a standard attribute. Overall, the code appears standard and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is primarily import statements with a potential concern regarding the wildcard import. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware in this snippet. It seems safe but should be reviewed in context of the imported modules.",
