  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the conclusions are justified, whether the scores align with the content, and if any adjustments are warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is straightforward, consisting solely of internal import statements and a version string. No external data, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The high confidence (1) is justified.\n- **Verdict:** **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the absence of dynamic code or external data handling. Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk (0.1), possibly due to the general nature of import statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion is appropriate. The minor security risk score is acceptable given the minimal concern over static imports.\n- **Verdict:** **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes the use of a wildcard import (`from .api import *`), which can be risky, but otherwise finds no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The slight increase in security risk (0.2) reflects the potential concern with wildcard imports, which can import unintended or malicious code if the source is compromised. The malware score remains zero, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- **Verdict:** The scoring seems reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard nature of the code, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the code content. The low confidence (1) is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing the typical import pattern and absence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No suspicious elements detected.\n- **Verdict:** **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard module import and version declaration.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, as no obfuscation patterns are present.\n- The security risk scores are minimal, with a slight increase in Report 3 due to the wildcard import, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are well-aligned with the code content.\n- No further adjustments are necessary.\n- The overall assessment indicates that this code snippet does not pose a security risk or contain malware.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to account for the wildcard import concern in Report 3, but still very low)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical package initialization module with no security issues. The scores reflect this accurately.",
