{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules and functions from within the package, setting up the package namespace and defining the version.",
  "sources": "The code reads from its own package modules: api, core, models, readers, utils.display_handler",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling points in this code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows are apparent; imports are static and do not involve untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements to include internal modules and functions, and setting a version string. No external data sources, user inputs, or dynamic code execution are present. The structure appears typical for a package's __init__.py or main module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code in these imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward module imports and version declaration with no evidence of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation. It appears to be part of a standard package setup.",
