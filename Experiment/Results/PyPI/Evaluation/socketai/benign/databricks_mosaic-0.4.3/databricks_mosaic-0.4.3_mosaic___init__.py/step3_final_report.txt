  "purpose": "Package initialization module importing internal components and setting version.",
  "sources": "Relative imports from internal modules (.api, .core, .models, .readers, .utils.display_handler).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or output sinks; static import statements only.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules into namespace; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (`from .api import *`) which can be risky if the source module is compromised, but common in package __init__.py files.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements and a version string assignment. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing is present. The wildcard import is a potential security concern but is standard in package setup. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The import pattern and straightforward structure suggest benign intent. The minimal security risk score reflects the minor concern associated with wildcard import, but overall, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the wildcard import, which is common but slightly elevates the security risk score. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose a security threat.",
