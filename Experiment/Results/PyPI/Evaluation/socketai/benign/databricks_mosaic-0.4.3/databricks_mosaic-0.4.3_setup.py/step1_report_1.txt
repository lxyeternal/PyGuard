{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import the 'setup' function from 'setuptools' for package installation; if 'setuptools' is not available, it falls back to 'distutils.core'. It then calls 'setup()' to initiate the package setup process.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'setuptools' module and the 'setup()' function call.",
  "sinks": "The 'setup()' function is called with no arguments, which is a standard practice in package setup scripts and does not act as a sink for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The source of data (import) flows into the 'setup()' call, but there are no untrusted inputs or external data sources being used or processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is a minimal and common setup script with a fallback import strategy.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward package setup invocation with a try-except block to handle missing dependencies, a common pattern in Python packaging. No malicious or suspicious code behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious data handling is present. It performs a standard operation without any anomalies or unusual code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign and typical Python package setup script. It does not contain malware, security risks, or obfuscated code. Its purpose is to facilitate package installation, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or security concerns.",
