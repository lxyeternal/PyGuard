  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal setup script: attempting to import 'setuptools' with a fallback to 'distutils.core', then calling setup() with no arguments.\n- The code is standard in Python packaging and contains no user input, external data, or network activity.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code as provided does **not** contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The logic is straightforward, and the code performs a common task with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- **No significant flaws** detected. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign, minimal, and standard for Python packaging.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0.5 or below, which is reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Justification of risk scores:\n- The risk score is 0 or very close to it because the code does not perform any dangerous operations.\n- Since the code is a minimal setup script, the risk is negligible.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the code is standard.\n- No external inputs or data are processed, so no injection or data manipulation risks exist.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to it, but 0 is appropriate)\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThis code is a typical, benign Python setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe and does not pose any security threat.",
