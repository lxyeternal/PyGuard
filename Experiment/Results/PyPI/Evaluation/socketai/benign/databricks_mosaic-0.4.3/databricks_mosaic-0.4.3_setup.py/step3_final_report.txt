  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script that attempts to import 'setuptools' with a fallback to 'distutils.core', then calls setup() with no arguments.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'setuptools' or 'distutils.core'",

  "flows": "Import attempt -> fallback import -> setup() invocation",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, minimal setup code with no suspicious or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, conventional Python setup script used for packaging. It conditionally imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' or 'distutils.core' and then calls setup() with no arguments. There are no untrusted inputs, external data processing, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and standard pattern indicate no security concerns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python setup script with no malicious or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
