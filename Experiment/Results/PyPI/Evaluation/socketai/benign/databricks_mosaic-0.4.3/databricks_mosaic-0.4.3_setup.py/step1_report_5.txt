  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python project.",
  "sources": "The import statements for 'setuptools' or 'distutils.core'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules necessary for packaging; no data flows from external sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and typical for a setup script, with no suspicious or unusual code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import 'setuptools' for packaging; if unavailable, it falls back to 'distutils.core'. It then calls 'setup()' with no arguments, which is standard for a basic setup script. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or anomalies are present. The code is a common, benign pattern used in Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs basic package configuration and distribution tasks without any suspicious or malicious logic.",
