  "purpose": "The code is used to set up a Python package for distribution, typically included in setup.py files.",
  "sources": "The import statements for 'setuptools' and 'distutils.core' to load setup functionality.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call, which initiates the package build/distribution process.",
  "flows": "Import statements -> setup() function invocation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is minimal and standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import 'setuptools' for enhanced setup capabilities; if unavailable, it falls back to 'distutils.core'. The setup() function is called with no arguments, which is common in simple setup scripts. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is observed. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard minimal setup script for Python packages with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
