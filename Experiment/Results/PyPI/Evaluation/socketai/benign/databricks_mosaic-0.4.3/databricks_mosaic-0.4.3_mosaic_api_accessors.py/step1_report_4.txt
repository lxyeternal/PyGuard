  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for converting geometrical data into various formats using the Mosaic context within a PySpark environment.",
  "sources": "Reads geometry data from ColumnOrName inputs, which are then converted via pyspark_to_java_column for invoking external functions.",
  "sinks": "Invokes functions through config.mosaic_context.invoke_function with converted Column data; potential risk if these functions are malicious or manipulated.",
  "flows": "Input geometries -> Conversion to Java Columns -> Function invocation via Mosaic context -> Output columns in different geometrical formats.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious variable names, or unusual code constructs. Usage of aliasing (_to_java_column) appears standard for PySpark interoperability. No suspicious data handling or unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several functions for converting geometrical data into formats like WKT, WKB, GeoJSON, etc., by invoking external functions via the Mosaic context. The functions rely on a consistent pattern of converting input columns to Java columns and calling external invoke_function methods. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious data flows. The external functions invoked are part of a known pattern for geometry processing and are not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The only potential concern is the reliance on external functions which could be malicious if compromised, but within this code, no malicious intent or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for spatial data conversion in PySpark, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The reliance on external invoke_function calls should be verified in a broader security review, but within this context, no immediate concerns are identified.",
