  "purpose": "Wrapper functions for spatial geometry conversions invoking external backend functions via 'invoke_function'.",
  "sources": "Input geometry columns provided to each function, converted via 'pyspark_to_java_column'.",
  "sinks": "The 'invoke_function' calls, which pass data to external spatial processing functions; potential risk depends on their implementation.",
  "flows": "Input columns -> 'pyspark_to_java_column' -> 'invoke_function' -> external spatial functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious control flows detected within this code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a benign wrapper around external spatial functions, converting Spark columns and delegating processing. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The security of the system hinges on the implementation of 'invoke_function', which is external and not visible here. The code itself is straightforward and standard for spatial data handling. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2) are consistent with this assessment, considering the external dependency. No logical flaws or anomalies are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard wrapper for spatial data conversions with no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The primary security concern is the external 'invoke_function', which cannot be evaluated here. Overall, the code appears safe, and the scores are appropriate given the context.",
