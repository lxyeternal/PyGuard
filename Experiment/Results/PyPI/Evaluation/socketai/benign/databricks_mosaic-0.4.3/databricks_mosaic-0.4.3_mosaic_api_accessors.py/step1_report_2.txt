{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for converting and representing geometrical data in various formats within a Spark context, primarily used for spatial data processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input geometrical data from the 'geom' parameter passed to each function, which is a ColumnOrName type.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'config.mosaic_context.invoke_function' with method names and Java column representations; potential data flow to external functions or systems.",
  "flows": "Input 'geom' -> 'pyspark_to_java_column(geom)' -> 'invoke_function' with method name -> function execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual or suspicious patterns. The function calls are standard for spatial data conversions. No dynamic code execution or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions that convert geometry data into different formats by invoking functions through 'config.mosaic_context'. Each function translates a geometry column into a specific spatial format. The functions rely on a standardized pattern: converting the input to a Java column object and invoking a named function in a context object. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The usage appears to be standard spatial data handling code, with no suspicious code flow or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate spatial data handling utility, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It strictly performs data format conversions using provided spatial functions within a Spark environment.",
