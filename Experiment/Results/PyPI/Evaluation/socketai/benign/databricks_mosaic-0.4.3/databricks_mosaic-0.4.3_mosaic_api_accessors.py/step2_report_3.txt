  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The code acts as a wrapper for spatial functions, invoking methods via `mosaic_context`. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident. The confidence is high (0.9), and malware is scored at 0, which aligns with the benign analysis.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the lack of malicious behavior and the code's nature, a risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate. No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes standard spatial data conversion functions. The concern is about `invoke_function` potentially executing external code, but no evidence of malicious activity is present. The confidence is high (0.9), and malware is 0.  \n- **Risk Score:** The low risk score (0.1) is reasonable. No change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the functions are wrappers around `invoke_function`. The main security concern is the potential for `invoke_function` to execute malicious code, but this cannot be confirmed from this snippet. The confidence is 0.8, and malware is 0.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the reliance on an external function that could be malicious, a slightly higher risk score could be justified, but since there's no evidence of malicious activity, 0.2 remains appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, standard spatial conversion functions. The main concern is the external invocation. No malicious activity detected. Confidence is high (0.9), malware is 0.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is appropriate; no change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—functions wrapping external calls for geometry conversions. No signs of malicious behavior. Confidence is high (0.9), malware is 0.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 remains suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, scoring malware at 0.  \n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly note no obfuscation, scoring at 0.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given that the core concern is the reliance on `invoke_function`, which could execute arbitrary code, a conservative but justified risk score would be around **0.2 to 0.3**. Since no malicious activity is detected, 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (accurate)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (accurate)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (appropriate given the potential for external code execution, but no evidence of actual malicious activity)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a set of spatial data format conversion wrappers that delegate processing to an external context. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident within this code snippet. The security risk hinges on the implementation of `invoke_function`, which is outside the scope of this code. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
