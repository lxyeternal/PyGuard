  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements for configuration and utility modules. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) are justified."
