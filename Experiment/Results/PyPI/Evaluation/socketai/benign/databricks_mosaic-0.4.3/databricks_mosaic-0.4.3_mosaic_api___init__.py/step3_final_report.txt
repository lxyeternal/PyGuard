{
  "purpose": "This code imports various internal modules and functions, likely for setup or configuration purposes within a larger package, with no immediate malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules and functions such as 'enable_mosaic', 'get_install_lib_dir', and 'get_install_version'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications are present; functions may access system info but do not process untrusted input here.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules; no data flow from source to sink is evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward module imports with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, including functions that could query system info. There is no dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscated code. The functions imported are typical for configuration or environment setup. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection, are present. The security implications are minimal, though functions like 'get_install_lib_dir' could access system info, but this is standard in setup modules. The malware score is therefore 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score approximately 0.1 to reflect potential system info access but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements for configuration and utility modules. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) are justified.",
