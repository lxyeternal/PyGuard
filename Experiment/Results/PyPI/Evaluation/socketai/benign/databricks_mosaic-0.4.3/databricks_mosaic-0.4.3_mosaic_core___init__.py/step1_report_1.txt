  "purpose": "Importing classes 'MosaicLibraryHandler' and 'MosaicContext' from local modules for use within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points are present in these import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable as these are static imports without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behavior observed in import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from relative modules within the package. There are no visible security issues, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious patterns. As this is only import code, it does not perform any data handling or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard module imports without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of a larger project structure.",
