  "purpose": "Import classes from local modules 'library_handler' and 'mosaic_context' for use within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements accessing local modules: '.library_handler' and '.mosaic_context'.",
  "sinks": "None; static import statements do not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; simple static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements importing classes from local modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not process external input, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. The import statements are standard for modular Python projects. Given the simplicity and static nature, the likelihood of malicious intent is negligible. The confidence in this assessment is high, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero. The security risk score is also zero, reflecting no security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, involving only local module imports with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code, and no further security measures are necessary.",
