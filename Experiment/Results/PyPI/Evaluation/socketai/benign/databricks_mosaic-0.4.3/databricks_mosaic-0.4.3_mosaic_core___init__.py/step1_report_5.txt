{
  "purpose": "This code appears to import classes 'MosaicLibraryHandler' and 'MosaicContext' from relative modules, likely for use in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current package's modules 'library_handler' and 'mosaic_context' for class definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data transmissions in these import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable here since it's only import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing specific classes from sibling modules. No input reading, data processing, or execution of dynamic or malicious code is present. The code is structurally simple and adheres to normal import practices. Since no further logic or data handling is included, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign module import statement with no suspicious activity.",
