  "purpose": "Importing classes from local modules, likely for managing library handling and context management within a larger application.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read directly in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs here, as this is only import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements with relative module paths; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "The snippet imports two classes from local modules: MosaicLibraryHandler and MosaicContext. These are likely part of a larger codebase. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, no external data handling, or risky code constructs. The code structure is straightforward and typical for modular Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign, serving as a module import. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks based solely on these import statements.",
