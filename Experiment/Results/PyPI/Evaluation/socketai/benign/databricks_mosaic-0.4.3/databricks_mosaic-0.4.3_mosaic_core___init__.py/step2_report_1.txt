  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks is presented.\n- The code is straightforward, with no data flows, external inputs, or dynamic code execution.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are zero across all reports, which is appropriate given the content.\n- The security risk scores are also zero or near-zero, consistent with the benign import statements.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n**Are the reported issues present?**  \nYes. All reports accurately identify that the code only contains import statements from local modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \nNo. The reasoning is consistent and correct. The reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**  \n- Confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty that the code is safe.\n- Malware scores are zero, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are minimal or zero, aligning with the benign nature.\n\n**Risk scores justification:**  \n- Since the code only involves static import statements without any dynamic or external data handling, the risk score of 0 or 0.1 is justified.\n- The report with a score of 0.1 for security risk (report 5) might be slightly cautious but still reasonable, considering the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** Correctly zero across all reports; no malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Zero or near-zero is appropriate, given the benign nature.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Overall malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0, unless additional context suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate, consistent, and reasonable. The code snippet is a standard module import, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The scoring aligns with the content.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms the code is benign, and no further security concerns are warranted based solely on these import statements.",
