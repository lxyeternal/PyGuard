  "purpose": "Import statements for local modules 'library_handler' and 'mosaic_context', likely setting up the environment or dependencies for a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; import statements themselves do not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed within this snippet; no source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures; the code is straightforward import syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code only includes two import statements importing local modules. There are no functions, data processing, or external communications. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code. The imports seem standard for modular Python applications.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears to be a standard module import section with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
