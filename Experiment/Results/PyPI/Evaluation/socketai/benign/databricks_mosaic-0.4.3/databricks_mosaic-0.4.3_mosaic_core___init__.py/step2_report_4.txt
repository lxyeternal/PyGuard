  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports focus solely on import statements of local modules and classes.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity.\n- The code snippets are straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1, one at 0.9), indicating the reviewers believe these are benign import statements.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and evaluations:\n\n**Issue presence:**\n- All reports correctly identify that these are import statements with no malicious behavior.\n- No issues are present in the code snippets themselves.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reports.\n- The reasoning is consistent and accurate, emphasizing the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are also 0 or very low, which is appropriate.\n- The `obfuscated` scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The `confidence` scores are high, reflecting certainty about benign intent.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n- Report 5 assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1 and confidence of 0.9, which is slightly more cautious but still indicates low risk. This seems reasonable given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign import statements.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Since these are purely import statements with no suspicious activity, a risk score of 0 or very close to 0 is justified.\n\n**However,** it's worth noting that:\n- Import statements alone generally do not pose security risks unless they load malicious modules, which isn't indicated here.\n- The reports do not mention any hidden or malicious modules, and the code is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n- The overall assessment is that these snippets are benign, with no malware or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate (after reviewing all reports):\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk based on provided code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code snippets are standard import statements with no malicious or risky behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
