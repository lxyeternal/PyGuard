{
  "purpose": "Defines a Starlette web application class with methods for routing, middleware, and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, and starlette modules; class constructor and methods that set attributes, build middleware stack, and handle routes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions are present.",
  "flows": "Application initialization and middleware setup flow, with route registration via decorators and methods, but no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; deprecation warnings indicate API style shifts, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a web application framework's core class, with methods for configuration and middleware management. It uses imports, class definitions, method decorators, and standard control flows. There are no signs of malicious code such as code injection, data leaks, or backdoors. Deprecated warnings are for API style and do not imply malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate part of the Starlette framework, responsible for setting up web applications with routing and middleware. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
