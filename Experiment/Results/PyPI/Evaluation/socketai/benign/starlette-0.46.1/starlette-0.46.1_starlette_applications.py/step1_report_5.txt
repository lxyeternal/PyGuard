{
  "purpose": "Defines a web application framework class 'Starlette' for creating ASGI-compatible web servers with routing, middleware, and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, warnings, starlette modules; class constructor parameters, property methods, and various API methods.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present. No code writes to network, filesystem, environment variables, or performs unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious data handling; methods primarily configure the web app without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains deprecated warning decorators which do not impact security; no unusual or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a web framework class, handling configuration and setup for routes, middleware, and error handling. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or data leaks are observed. It primarily provides an API for users to define application behavior. The only notable aspect is use of deprecation warnings, which are standard and not malicious. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard framework class definition for web app configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security threats within this module.",
