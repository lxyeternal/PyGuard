  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a class that sets up a Starlette app, with routing, middleware, and exception handling. No external data sources or suspicious behaviors noted.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks, external writes, or code injections. Focused on configuration.\n- **Anomalies:** Deprecation warnings for API styles, typical during API evolution.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard framework code, no malicious activity, no obfuscated code, and no external data flows that could be exploited.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malicious code detected.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — clear, straightforward code.  \n- Risk: 0 — no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard class management of middleware, routes, exception handlers, and lifecycle events.  \n- No suspicious patterns, no external data leaks, no obfuscated code.  \n- Deprecated warnings are normal API maintenance.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to deprecated API warnings, not security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Again, describes a typical web framework class with configuration methods.  \n- No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns.  \n- Deprecated API warnings are present but benign.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 — similar reasoning as above.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Highlights the same pattern: a class managing routing, middleware, exception handling.  \n- No external data sinks, no unsafe operations, no obfuscation.  \n- Focused on internal configuration.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same overall pattern: a core framework class for web apps, with no external data leaks or malicious code.  \n- Mentions deprecated warnings but nothing malicious.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected across all reports. The code is standard framework setup code.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low; mainly deprecated API warnings, which are normal during API transitions.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** No evidence of input injection, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n- **Supply Chain Concerns:** The code appears to be a legitimate part of the Starlette framework, not an injected malicious module.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, related to API deprecation warnings, not security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured implementation of a web framework core class. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The deprecation warnings are typical for maintaining backward compatibility and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Therefore, my final estimates are:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis is needed.",
