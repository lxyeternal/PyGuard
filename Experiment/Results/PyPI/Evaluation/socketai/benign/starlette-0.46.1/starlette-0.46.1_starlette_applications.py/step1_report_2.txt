  "purpose": "Defines a Starlette web application framework class that manages routing, middleware, exception handling, and application lifecycle events.",
  "sources": "Imports from system modules, starlette framework modules, and the class constructor and methods which set up middleware, routes, exception handlers, and lifecycle events.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or written to external systems, files, or network connections within this code.",
  "flows": "Initialization sets up application configurations; build_middleware_stack constructs middleware layers; __call__ handles incoming requests by invoking middleware; various add_* methods modify application components without external data dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a web framework class, managing middleware, routes, exception handlers, and lifecycle events. It includes deprecation warnings for outdated decorator styles, which is typical for maintaining backward compatibility. No input/output sources suggest malicious activity. The imports are from standard Python and starlette packages, and no external or untrusted data sources are handled insecurely.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of a web application framework class. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code primarily manages internal configurations and provides interfaces for users to extend functionality, with no signs of supply chain attack vectors or malware.",
