  "purpose": "Defines a core class for a Starlette web application, managing routing, middleware, exception handling, and lifecycle events.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard modules and starlette packages; no external data sources or input points; configuration code.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal configuration and setup only; no data leaks or external writes.",
  "flows": "Configuration methods setting up routing, middleware, and exception handlers; no external data flow or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of deprecation warnings for API styles; no suspicious or malicious code patterns; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard framework class establishing application structure. It contains no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data exfiltration. The deprecation warnings are typical during API transitions and do not indicate malicious intent. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with common framework patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, benign component of the Starlette framework. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The deprecation warnings are normal and do not suggest malicious activity.",
