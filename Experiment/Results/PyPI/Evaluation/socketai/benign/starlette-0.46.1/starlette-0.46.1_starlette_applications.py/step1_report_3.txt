  "purpose": "Defines the Starlette application class for creating web servers with routing, middleware, and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules, defines class constructor, methods for middleware, routing, exception handling, and utility functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses middleware stacking, route adding, and exception handling; no direct data sinks or external data outputs identified.",
  "flows": "Initializes application configuration, constructs middleware stack, handles incoming requests via __call__, manages routes and middleware addition.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. Presence of deprecated warning decorators indicates legacy API, but not malicious. No code injection or unsafe data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a web application framework class, with methods to configure middleware, routes, exception handlers, and lifecycle events. It employs typical patterns and external libraries (starlette). No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution mechanisms are present. Deprecated API warnings do not suggest malicious intent but indicate older, possibly less secure API usage. Overall, the code appears to be a benign, structural component of the framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a core component of the Starlette web framework, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It primarily provides an API for application setup and request handling, using standard patterns. There are no indications of malware or security vulnerabilities within this fragment.",
