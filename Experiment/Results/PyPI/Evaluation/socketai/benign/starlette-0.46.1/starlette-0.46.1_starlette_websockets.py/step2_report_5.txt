  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a standard implementation of an ASGI WebSocket handler, managing connection states, message transmission, and reception.\n   - No report indicates any functional issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior.\n   - The code does not exhibit obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or hardcoded secrets.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, with no apparent logical flaws or reasoning errors.\n   - They correctly identify that the code follows best practices for WebSocket handling.\n   - No overstatement or unwarranted concerns are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: between 0.1 and 0.2\n   - These seem reasonable given the absence of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any significant security risk.\n   - The scores of 0.1 or 0.2 are appropriate, reflecting low but non-zero risk due to the inherent complexity of WebSocket handling.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior detected.\n   - This aligns with the analysis; no malware or backdoors are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions; they all base their conclusions on code analysis and standard WebSocket practices.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed reasoning.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n**0** — No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malware.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n**0** — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation techniques.\n\n**Security Risk Score:**  \n**0.1 to 0.2** — Slight inherent risk due to WebSocket complexity, but no specific vulnerabilities identified.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured WebSocket handler for ASGI applications.\n- No evidence of supply chain compromise, malicious payloads, or backdoors.\n- The low security risk score is appropriate, considering the context.\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nThe overall assessment confirms that this code is safe, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The provided scores are reasonable and justified based on the detailed analysis.",
