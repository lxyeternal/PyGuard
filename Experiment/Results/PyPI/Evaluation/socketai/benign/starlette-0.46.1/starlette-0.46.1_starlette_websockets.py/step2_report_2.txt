  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present in code?** No, the code is a standard WebSocket handler.\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?** None identified; the reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0 — reasonable.\n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?** Not applicable; risk is low.\n- **Malware score?** Correctly zero; no malicious behavior.\n- **Assumptions?** None; the report is cautious and reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, well-reasoned, and consistent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No, standard WebSocket management.\n- **Errors, flaws?** None apparent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Malware?** Correctly zero.\n- **Assumptions?** No unwarranted assumptions.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate and thorough.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No, typical WebSocket handler.\n- **Errors?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0 — fitting.\n- **Malware?** Correct.\n- **Assumptions?** No, the analysis is cautious.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Malware?** Correct.\n- **Assumptions?** No unwarranted assumptions.\n- **Conclusion:** Sound.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0 — consistent.\n- **Malware?** Correct.\n- **Assumptions?** No.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, but all are low (0.1–0.2), which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n### Final Systematic Evaluation:\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured WebSocket handler.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- No obfuscation or external malicious network activity.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious intent or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk, primarily due to the inherent complexity of WebSocket handling, but no vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
