{
  "purpose": "This code implements a WebSocket handler class for ASGI applications, managing WebSocket connection states, message receiving/sending, and connection control.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the receive method (_receive), and some parameters like headers, subprotocols, and message content are provided through method arguments.",
  "sinks": "Messages are sent via the _send method, which outputs data to the client; no external data sinks or data exfiltration points are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the receive method, processed within the class methods (e.g., receive_text, receive_bytes, receive_json). Data sent to the client flows through send, send_text, send_bytes, and send_json. The accept and close methods control WebSocket connection states.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code appears standard for WebSocket handling. No obfuscated code, suspicious network operations, or privacy violations are evident. The exception handling aligns with normal WebSocket management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a WebSocket class managing connection states, message exchanges, and disconnections. It handles message types and state transitions carefully, raising errors on unexpected states or message types. It does not contain any external data leaks, suspicious network calls, or hidden behaviors. The logic appears straightforward and consistent with typical WebSocket implementations. No malicious or sabotage elements are detected, and the code maintains standard security practices for WebSocket handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign WebSocket handler implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected state management and message processing without any suspicious behaviors. Overall, it is a normal component for managing WebSocket connections in an ASGI context.",
