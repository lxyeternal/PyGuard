  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is a standard WebSocket handler with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0. Reasonable.\n- **Justification for Scores:** No malicious or obfuscated code; low security risk due to WebSocket handling nature.\n- **Overall:** Safe, standard implementation.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Similar to Report 1, standard WebSocket management.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0. Reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No external or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Overall:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Again, a typical WebSocket class with proper state management.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0. Reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Overall:** Safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Standard WebSocket handling.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0. Reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity.\n- **Overall:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Well-structured WebSocket class.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0. Reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Overall:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malware activity (score=0). The code is a standard WebSocket handler with no suspicious network activity, code injection, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports show no obfuscation (score=0). The code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—standard WebSocket management—the risk is minimal. The highest reported risk is 0.2, which is low. No evidence suggests any security vulnerability beyond typical WebSocket handling.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-implemented WebSocket handler with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and align with the observed code behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- No malicious or obfuscated elements are present.\n- The security risk remains low, primarily due to the inherent nature of WebSocket handling, not because of any vulnerabilities in this implementation.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed to the reported scores.",
