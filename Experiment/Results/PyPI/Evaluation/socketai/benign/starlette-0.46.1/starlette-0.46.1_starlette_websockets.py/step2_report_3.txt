  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports conclude that the code is a standard WebSocket handler, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n   - The code manages WebSocket states properly, handles messages, and includes no suspicious external calls or obfuscated logic.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n\n2. **Obfuscation:**\n   - No obfuscated code or techniques are mentioned or evident.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, which seems appropriate.\n\n3. **Risk Scores:**\n   - The security risk scores are generally low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n   - Given the thorough analysis, these seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Logic and Reasoning Flaws:**\n   - The reports' reasoning is consistent and thorough.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a standard WebSocket implementation with no malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or flawed assumptions are evident.\n\n5. **Scores Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The confidence levels are high (0.9 to 0.95), matching the detailed reasoning.\n\n6. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are found.\n   - The only minor point is that the code does not perform origin validation or message validation beyond type checks, but this is typical and outside the scope of this module.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's purpose and the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, a low risk score of around 0.1 to 0.2 is justified.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard WebSocket handler with proper state management)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a well-implemented, standard WebSocket handler for ASGI applications, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks beyond typical WebSocket handling. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
