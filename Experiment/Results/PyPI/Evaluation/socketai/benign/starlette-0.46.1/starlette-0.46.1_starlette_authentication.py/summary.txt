  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of scope-based authorization decorators with associated user classes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential misconfiguration rather than malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, which is appropriate given the context."
