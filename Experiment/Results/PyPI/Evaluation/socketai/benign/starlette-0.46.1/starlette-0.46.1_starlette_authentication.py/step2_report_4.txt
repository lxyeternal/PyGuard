  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Describes standard scope verification, URL redirection, and websocket closure.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. The logic is straightforward, handling authorization with standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; the code is a typical authorization middleware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to report 1, with focus on scope validation and standard auth flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of `assert` statements for type checks; while common, if assertions are disabled, type validation could be bypassed, but this is a standard practice rather than malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, just standard auth code with minor caveats.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malware, no obfuscation, and the security risk is minimal.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Emphasizes scope checks, redirects, websocket closures, standard patterns.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no backdoors. The scope validation logic is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are consistent.\n- **Justification:** No malicious features detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar pattern, with standard scope validation, redirects, and websocket handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hidden logic or malicious code; straightforward implementation.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is transparent and standard.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Same as others, scope checks, URL redirects, websocket closures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard access control implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 fit the description.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration. The malware score should remain **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation or dynamic code patterns are present. The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** The overall security risk is low, given the code's purpose and implementation. The reported scores of 0.2 are reasonable, but perhaps slightly conservative. Given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious features, a risk score of **0.1** might be more accurate.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, transparent implementation of scope-based authorization decorators and user classes. It performs expected functions without any malicious or obfuscated features. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable but could be slightly lowered for risk, given the thorough analysis and lack of suspicious activity.",
