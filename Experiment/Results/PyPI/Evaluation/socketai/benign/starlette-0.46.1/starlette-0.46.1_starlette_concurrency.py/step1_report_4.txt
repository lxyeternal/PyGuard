{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for asynchronous task management, running functions in thread pools, and iterating over iterables asynchronously, mainly for concurrency and threading support.",
  "sources": "The code reads sys.version_info for version checking, imports modules (anyio, functools, sys, warnings, typing), and uses function parameters and global imports as data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks that handle untrusted data, perform data leaks, or execute potentially malicious commands. The code does not write to files, network, or system in an unsafe way.",
  "flows": "The code initializes imports and version checks (source) and passes functions to run in threads or task groups (sink), which are run asynchronously. No data flows directly from untrusted sources to sinks; functions passed as arguments are invoked in controlled contexts.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious network calls, or hidden backdoors. Usage of deprecated warnings and internal exception handling is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. The custom _StopIteration class is a normal pattern for managing iteration in threading contexts.",
  "analysis": "The script defines asynchronous utilities for task execution and threadpool management using the 'anyio' library, which is a standard approach in asynchronous Python code. The deprecation warning suggests maintenance but not malicious intent. The functions rely on safe concurrency practices, and there are no signs of code obfuscation, malicious data handling, or backdoors. The custom exception _StopIteration is used to safely handle iteration completion in threaded context, which is a known pattern. Overall, the code appears to serve legitimate concurrency and threading purposes without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of concurrency utility functions with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It uses standard patterns for threading and async execution, with no suspicious network activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The overall security risk is low.",
