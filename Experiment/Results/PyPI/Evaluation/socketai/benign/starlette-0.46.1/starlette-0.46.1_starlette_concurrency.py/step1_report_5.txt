{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for running asynchronous tasks, threadpool execution, and safe iteration over iterators, primarily designed for use with the anyio library.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data; it mainly defines functions and classes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "Function definitions flow into their internal logic; no external data flow or untrusted data passing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated function warning, custom exception handling for iterator control, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for asynchronous execution, threadpool management, and iterator control. No external input handling, data leakage, or malicious data processing is present. The deprecation warning indicates maintenance but not malicious intent. The custom exception '_StopIteration' is used to manage iterator flow safely across threads, which is a recognized pattern. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, intended for concurrency management and safe iteration in asynchronous Python applications. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
