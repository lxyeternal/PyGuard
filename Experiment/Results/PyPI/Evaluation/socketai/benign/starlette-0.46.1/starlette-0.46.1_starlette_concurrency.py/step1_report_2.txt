  "purpose": "Utility functions for asynchronous execution, threadpool operations, and iteration handling in Python.",
  "sources": "Code reads function arguments, environment info (`sys.version_info`), and uses imported modules. No untrusted input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "Function calls that run external code (`func`, `run_sync`), and threadpool execution which could be misused if `func` is malicious.",
  "flows": "Input functions/iterators are passed to threadpool runners or asynchronous task groups, with no evident data leakage or malicious command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of custom exception `_StopIteration` for control flow is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides async task management (`run_until_first_complete`), threadpool execution (`run_in_threadpool`), and custom iteration (`iterate_in_threadpool`). It handles standard asynchronous patterns with warnings about deprecated functions. No indicators of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or system compromise are present. The code appears to be utility-oriented, focusing on concurrency and threading, with no external or untrusted data sources or sinks beyond normal function calls.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of concurrency utility functions with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It operates purely within expected asynchronous and threading paradigms without suspicious logic or data handling.",
