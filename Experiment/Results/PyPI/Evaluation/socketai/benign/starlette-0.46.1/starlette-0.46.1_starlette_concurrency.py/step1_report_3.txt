{
  "purpose": "This code provides asynchronous utilities for running functions concurrently, in thread pools, and iterating over iterables asynchronously.",
  "sources": "The code reads standard library modules, third-party modules (anyio, functools, sys, warnings, typing, typing_extensions). No external or untrusted input sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "The code executes functions via functools.partial and run_sync, but only with internal parameters. No external data or untrusted input flows into potentially dangerous sinks.",
  "flows": "Functions are scheduled and run asynchronously; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks in the code itself.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; the code mainly implements common asynchronous utility functions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. No obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or data leaks are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code provides asynchronous task management functions, including deprecated task running, thread pool execution, and iterator iteration. It employs safe and standard patterns with no suspicious code or malicious behavior. The use of warnings indicates awareness of deprecation but not malicious intent. No external data sources or sinks are used in a potentially harmful way. The custom exception _StopIteration is used internally for iterator control, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a standard utility for asynchronous execution in Python, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code is well-structured and safe.",
