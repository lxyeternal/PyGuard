  "purpose": "Utility functions for asynchronous task management, thread pool execution, and safe iteration handling in Python.",
  "sources": "Function calls to user-provided functions, iterators, and environment info (via sys.version_info).",
  "sinks": "Execution of provided functions in thread pools; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input functions and iterators are invoked within async or thread contexts; no external data flows or leaks observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom _StopIteration exception for iteration control, which is a known pattern; no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard async and threading utilities with proper handling of iteration and task management. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The deprecation warning indicates maintenance status, not malicious intent. The custom exception _StopIteration is used safely for internal control flow. All signals point to benign, utility-focused code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility library for asynchronous and threaded execution. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
