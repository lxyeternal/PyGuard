{
  "purpose": "Serve static files efficiently within an ASGI application, with support for directory and package-based static content.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the request scope, particularly the request path and method; reads configuration from file system and package specifications.",
  "sinks": "Serves files via FileResponse; potentially handles directory traversal prevention; redirects for directory URLs.",
  "flows": "User requests -> get_path() extracts and normalizes the path -> get_response() looks up the file path -> if static file, returns FileResponse; if directory, may redirect or serve index.html -> possible fallback to 404.html.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.path.realpath() for symlink resolution which is normal; no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code observed. No code injection or dynamic execution features present. The use of importlib.util.find_spec() is standard for package discovery.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard static file serving with directory validation, symlink following control, and directory traversal prevention via commonpath checks. It includes normal features like index.html serving and 404 fallback pages. No suspicious behavior such as network communications, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors is evident. The only potential concern could be the use of realpath and symlink handling, but this is typical for static file servers. No signs of malicious code or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical static file server implementation with proper security checks and no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It handles static content serving securely and efficiently without introducing security risks.",
