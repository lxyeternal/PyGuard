  "purpose": "Define and manage background task execution, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous callables.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (func, args, kwargs), class instantiation with task list.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the provided functions, potentially running untrusted code passed as arguments.",
  "flows": "Task creation via BackgroundTask or add_task → storing tasks in list → __call__ method executes tasks asynchronously.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or network operations. Use of run_in_threadpool is standard for background thread execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for background task management, supporting both async and sync functions by leveraging is_async_callable and run_in_threadpool. It safely manages tasks in a list, executes them asynchronously, and properly handles both sync and async functions. No suspicious code, no external network calls, no data leakage mechanisms, and no hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for background task management. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this module.",
