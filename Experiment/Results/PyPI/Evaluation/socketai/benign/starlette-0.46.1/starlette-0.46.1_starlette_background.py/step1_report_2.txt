  "purpose": "Define classes for managing and executing background tasks asynchronously, supporting both sync and async functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for __init__ and add_task methods: func, args, kwargs; internal function references; imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Execution of provided functions (func), potential call to untrusted functions, execution in threadpool.",
  "flows": "func (source) → __call__ method → run_in_threadpool or await func (sink); add_task creates BackgroundTask instances (source) which are later executed (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures; code primarily manages task scheduling and execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes to manage background task execution, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous functions. It uses existing utilities from 'starlette' for async detection and threadpool execution. The class design appears standard, with no signs of malicious code such as network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications. It relies on safe Python concurrency practices and external utilities. No obfuscated or suspicious logic is present. Overall, this code serves a typical purpose in asynchronous task handling with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, intended for background task management within an application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks identified. It leverages standard concurrency patterns and external libraries appropriately.",
