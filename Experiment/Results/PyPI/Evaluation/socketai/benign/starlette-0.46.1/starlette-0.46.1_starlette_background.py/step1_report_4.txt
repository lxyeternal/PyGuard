{
  "purpose": "This code defines a framework for running background tasks asynchronously or in separate threads within a web application environment.",
  "sources": "Reads function references, arguments, and keyword arguments when creating tasks; reads 'tasks' list when initializing 'BackgroundTasks'.",
  "sinks": "Executes provided functions asynchronously or in thread pools; no direct data leaks or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Function calls and task executions flow from task creation to execution, either asynchronously or via thread pool.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The use of 'run_in_threadpool' is standard for background execution. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code properly distinguishes between async and sync callables using 'is_async_callable'. Tasks are stored and executed sequentially. Uses standard libraries and practices for background processing. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious side effects. No external network calls or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of background task management without malicious intent or security issues. It safely handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions for background execution.",
