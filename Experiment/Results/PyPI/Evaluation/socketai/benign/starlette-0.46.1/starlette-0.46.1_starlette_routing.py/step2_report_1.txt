  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a routing and middleware framework for ASGI servers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from route configs and URL parameters into request handling; no evidence of untrusted data misuse.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of warnings for deprecation is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate framework code, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard web framework logic. The low security risk score aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. The malware score is appropriately zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—routing, URL, and host matching.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data from scope, headers, and parameters into regex matching and URL generation; no malicious use.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of deprecated warnings and reflection (get_name, get_route_path) are typical in evolving frameworks. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, standard routing code. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious patterns are evident. The slightly higher security risk score (0.2) accounts for the reliance on user input in routing, but overall, it's a benign framework component.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Issue:** \"Empty response\" with no further details.\n- **Analysis:** No substantive information; no code review possible.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1 (possibly due to incomplete info).\n\n**Assessment:** No evidence of malicious code. The minimal score is appropriate given the lack of data.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Routing, URL generation, and lifecycle management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data from scope, headers, URL parameters; no code execution or data exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of deprecated warnings and reflection, but no malicious intent. Proper handling of untrusted data.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard routing framework, no malicious activity. Confidence 0.95, malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. The low malware score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Routing, WebSocket, and lifecycle management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Similar to previous reports; data flows into URL matching and request handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. Warnings about deprecated APIs are normal.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent, standard routing code. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, as the code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied (0.1–0.2), reflecting the potential risks from untrusted data handling and deprecated features, but none indicating high security threats.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reported assessments. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured web framework component with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Security risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, mainly due to deprecated features and handling user input in routing, but no active vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The supply chain security incident reports are accurate; the code is safe and legitimate.",
