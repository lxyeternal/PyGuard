{
  "purpose": "The code implements routing, middleware, WebSocket handling, and lifecycle management for an ASGI web framework, facilitating URL pattern matching, request dispatching, and application lifecycle events.",
  "sources": "URL path parameters, request scope data, headers, and configuration inputs used during route matching and URL generation.",
  "sinks": "Generation of URL paths, hostnames, and request responses; no untrusted data is executed or transmitted maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input data from scope, headers, and parameters flows into regex matching, URL building, and request handling functions without executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecation warnings and reflection-like attribute access are typical in evolving frameworks; no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard web framework routing and middleware system, with clear structure and no signs of malware or obfuscation. It handles URL matching, request dispatch, and lifecycle events securely. No hardcoded secrets, code injection, or network activity indicative of malicious behavior are present. The deprecation warnings are normal during API transitions. The data flows involve user input in URL and host parameters but are managed with proper conversions and escaping, reducing security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured web framework component with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are accurate and justified.",
