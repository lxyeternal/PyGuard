  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for HTTP and WebSocket errors, including status codes, reasons, and headers.",
  "sources": "Input data from exception initialization parameters such as status_code, detail, headers, code, and reason.",
  "sinks": "String representations (__str__, __repr__) that output exception details; no untrusted data processing or external calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class attributes and are used in string representations for debugging or logging.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed. The code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes with constructors accepting input parameters. It converts status codes to phrases using http.HTTPStatus, which is standard and safe. The string representations are simple and do not execute any code or access external resources. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for HTTP and WebSocket errors. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The overall structure is clean, and the code serves a typical purpose in web applications.",
