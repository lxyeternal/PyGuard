  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the provided assessments.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- Defines two custom exception classes: `HTTPException` and `WebSocketException`.\n- Both classes initialize with parameters relevant to HTTP and WebSocket errors.\n- Use standard modules (`http`) and type annotations.\n- String representations are straightforward, intended for debugging or logging.\n- No external system calls, data leaks, or malicious code are present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Observations:\n- The code is a standard, benign implementation of exception classes.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The logic is simple, transparent, and adheres to common practices.\n\n### Issues in the Reports:\n- All reports agree on the benign nature and correctness.\n- They do not identify any vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or suspicious logic.\n- The reasoning is consistent and sound.\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** All assign 0 or 0.5; given the code's benign nature, 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Since the code is straightforward and secure, the scores are reasonable.\n- No changes needed in the scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical exception class implementation.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or malicious payloads.\n- The string representations are safe and do not execute code.\n- The use of `http.HTTPStatus` is standard and safe.\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is safe, clear, and free of security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
