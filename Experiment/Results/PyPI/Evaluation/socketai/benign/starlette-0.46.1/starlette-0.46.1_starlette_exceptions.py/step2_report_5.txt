  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Logic Confirmation**:\n   - The code defines two exception classes, `HTTPException` and `WebSocketException`.\n   - Both classes initialize with parameters relevant to their context (status code, detail, headers for HTTP; code, reason for WebSocket).\n   - They generate string representations for debugging or logging.\n   - The code uses `http.HTTPStatus(status_code).phrase` to convert status codes to phrases, which is standard and safe.\n   - No external data processing, dynamic code execution, or system calls are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is standard exception class definitions.\n   - They note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The reports' assessments that the code is benign and standard are accurate.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification**:\n   - Since there's no malicious activity, malware score remains 0.\n   - The code does not perform any obfuscation or suspicious behavior, so obfuscated remains 0.\n   - Security risk is minimal as the code is purely for exception handling and does not interact with external systems or process untrusted data.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code's purpose and behavior.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities or malicious intent are claimed.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency & Final Estimation**:\n   - The collective analysis aligns with the conclusion that this is standard, safe code.\n   - My own assessment concurs: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.\n\n**Final Summary**:\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for HTTP and WebSocket errors.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n- No modifications or concerns are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is benign, with no security risks or malware indications. The provided scores and analysis are accurate.",
