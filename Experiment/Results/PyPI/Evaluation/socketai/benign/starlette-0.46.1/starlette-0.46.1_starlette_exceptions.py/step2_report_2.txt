  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, defining custom exception classes with standard attributes.\n- No external data processing, dynamic execution, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code uses standard modules (`http`) and type annotations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- String representations are simple and used for debugging or logging.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code converts `status_code` to a phrase using `http.HTTPStatus(status_code).phrase`, which is safe and standard.\n- The exception classes are simple data containers with no external calls or side effects.\n- The overall purpose appears to be error handling in a web application context.\n\n**Malware and security risk assessment:**\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is also 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that the exception classes are used solely for error reporting and do not process untrusted data in a harmful way.\n- No evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities is found.\n- The string representations are safe and do not execute code or access external resources.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious behavior detected.\n- The risk score of 0 is appropriate; the code is standard and does not introduce security risks.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No suspicious patterns, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
