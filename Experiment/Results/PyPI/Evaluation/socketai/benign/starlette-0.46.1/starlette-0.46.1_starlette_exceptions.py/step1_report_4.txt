  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for HTTP and WebSocket errors with detailed information.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or external interactions, no untrusted data flow or system effects.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the classes are purely data containers with no external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code creates two custom exception classes, 'HTTPException' and 'WebSocketException', with constructors initializing attributes and string representations. No input reading, data processing, or external system interaction occurs. The implementation appears standard for exception handling in Python. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code does not include obfuscation or malicious payloads. It serves as a straightforward error handling utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of custom exception classes for HTTP and WebSocket errors. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are present. It appears to be standard, well-structured code with no indications of security concerns.",
