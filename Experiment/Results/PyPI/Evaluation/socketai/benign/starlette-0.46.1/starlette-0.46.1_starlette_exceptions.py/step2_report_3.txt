  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes (`HTTPException` and `WebSocketException`) with no suspicious behavior.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data beyond parameter storage, nor does it perform external calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.\n   - The string representations are simple and used for debugging or logging, with no security implications.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and free of security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - `securityRisk` scores are also 0 across the board, which is appropriate.\n   - `obfuscated` scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - `confidence` is 1, indicating high certainty, which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No issues warrant a risk score above 0.5. The code is standard exception handling, with no malicious or vulnerable elements.\n   - All scores are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware scores are 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - No claims or evidence suggest malicious intent.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities or malicious activities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a clean, standard implementation of custom exception classes for HTTP and WebSocket errors.\n- No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Own Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe code is safe, straightforward, and serves a common purpose in error handling.\n\n**Final notes:**\n- No changes needed to the reports or scores.\n- The code is benign and should not be flagged for security concerns.",
