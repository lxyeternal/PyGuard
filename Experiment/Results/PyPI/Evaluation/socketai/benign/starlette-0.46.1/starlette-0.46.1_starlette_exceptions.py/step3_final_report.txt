{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for HTTP and WebSocket errors, encapsulating error details and providing string representations for debugging.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed during exception instantiation: status_code, detail, headers for HTTPException; code, reason for WebSocketException.",
  "sinks": "String representations (__str__, __repr__) used for logging/debugging; no external data sinks or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class attributes and are used in string methods; no external or untrusted data flow beyond parameter storage.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard modules, and contains no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes with clear, standard initialization and string methods. It uses the 'http' module to convert status codes to phrases safely. No external calls, dynamic execution, or malicious code are present. The code serves error handling purposes and is free of security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The logic is sound, and the code adheres to best practices for exception handling in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for HTTP and WebSocket errors. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in all reports are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
