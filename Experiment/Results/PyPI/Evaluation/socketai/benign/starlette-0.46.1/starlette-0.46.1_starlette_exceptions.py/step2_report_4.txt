  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code defines two exception classes: `HTTPException` and `WebSocketException`.\n- They accept parameters relevant to their respective error types.\n- They generate string representations for debugging/logging.\n- The code uses standard modules (`http`) and type annotations.\n- No external data processing, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validity of the Reports:\n\n**Report 1-5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Accurately describes the code's intent.\n- **Sources:** Correctly identifies input parameters.\n- **Sinks:** String representations are benign.\n- **Flows:** Data flows are straightforward and safe.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Consistent across reports; all agree the code is benign and standard.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- **Confidence:** 1 (fully confident)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malware)\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, the code matches the description; no issues are present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports correctly interpret the code as standard exception classes.\n\n- **Scores suggested seem reasonable?**  \n  Yes, all reports assign maximum confidence and zero malware/security risk.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None; the code is benign.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  The code does not perform any malicious actions. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports are based on straightforward analysis.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report?**  \n  Yes, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security issues.** The scores assigned in all reports are accurate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, with no hidden malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action needed.",
