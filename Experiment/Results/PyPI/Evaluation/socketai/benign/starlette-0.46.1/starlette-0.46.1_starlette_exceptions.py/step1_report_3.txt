  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for HTTP and WebSocket errors with structured information.",
  "sources": "Input data includes parameters passed to exception constructors: status_code, detail, headers, code, reason.",
  "sinks": "String representations (__str__, __repr__) of exceptions, potential logging or error reporting.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> exception objects -> __str__ / __repr__ methods output strings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two exception classes, each initializing with parameters relevant to HTTP and WebSocket errors. The __str__ and __repr__ methods produce string representations of the exceptions. No untrusted data processing beyond parameter storage. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious logic present. Usage appears to be standard for error handling in networked applications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward exception class definitions for handling HTTP and WebSocket errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions purely as error representation without any suspicious activity.",
