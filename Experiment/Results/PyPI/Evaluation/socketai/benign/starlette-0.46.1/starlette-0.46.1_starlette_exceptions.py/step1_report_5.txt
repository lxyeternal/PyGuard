{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for HTTP and WebSocket errors with structured attributes and string representations.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input parameters 'status_code', 'detail', 'headers' in HTTPException, and 'code', 'reason' in WebSocketException.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted beyond attribute assignment.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to class attributes; no flow of untrusted data to external systems or functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The use of default HTTP status phrases and exception classes appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes, each initializing with parameters related to HTTP and WebSocket error states. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or external communications occur. No suspicious patterns or security risks are evident. The code is straightforward and adheres to common practices for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a standard implementation for custom exceptions with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears safe and compliant with expected coding standards.",
