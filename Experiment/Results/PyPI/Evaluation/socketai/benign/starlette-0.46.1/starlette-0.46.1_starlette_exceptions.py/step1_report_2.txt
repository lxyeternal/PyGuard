  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for HTTP and WebSocket errors with detailed attributes and string representations.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from exception instantiation parameters (status_code, detail, headers, code, reason). No external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform side effects. Exception message strings could be used for logging or display.",
  "flows": "Exception classes store input parameters; string methods generate output messages. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks that cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward class definitions with typical exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes with initializers and string representations. It uses standard modules (http) and type annotations. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior detected. The classes are used for error reporting and do not perform any external operations or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for HTTP and WebSocket errors. No malicious intent or security risks identified.",
