  "purpose": "The code defines the version of a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "None; no data input or reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "None; trivial version assignment with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string representing a version number to a variable '__version__'. There are no additional statements, no imports, no data processing, and no suspicious constructs. It is a standard practice for Python packages to declare their version this way. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign version declaration with no indication of malicious behavior or security issues.",
