  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**: All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the variable `__version__`. There are no other code elements, no input/output, no external data sources, and no logic beyond this assignment.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies**: Every report explicitly states that there are no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, and no malicious intent. The code is standard practice for Python packages to declare their version this way.\n\n3. **Scores Consistency & Justification**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is justified since this is a benign version declaration.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that this snippet alone does not pose any security threat.\n   - There are no claims based on assumptions about potential vulnerabilities; the analysis is straightforward.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency & Recommendations**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No changes are necessary; the assessments are accurate.\n\n**My own evaluation**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (transparent, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final notes**:\nThis code snippet is a minimal, benign declaration of a package version, common in Python projects. There is no indication of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is safe and standard.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n- No further action needed.\n\nPlease let me know if you need analysis of additional code snippets or further insights.",
