  "analysis": "The code only sets a version string for the module, which is a common practice in Python packages. There are no inputs, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code are present. The minimal code indicates it's likely part of a larger project and solely serves versioning purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, simply setting a version variable with no malicious intent or security risks.",
