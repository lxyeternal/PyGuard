  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no data flows, inputs, outputs, or external interactions.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n   - The code is benign and serves as standard package metadata.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign, with no security issues.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, there's no need to justify higher risk scores.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, data handling, or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This aligns with the analysis; there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as standard metadata.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and appropriate.** The code snippet is a straightforward version declaration with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided scores are reasonable and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
