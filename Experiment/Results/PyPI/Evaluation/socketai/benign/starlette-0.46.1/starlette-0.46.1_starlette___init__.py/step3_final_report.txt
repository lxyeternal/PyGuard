  "sinks": "None; no data flow, input/output, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; simple assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no input/output, no external dependencies, no functions, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency. No anomalies or malicious behavior are present. The code is a standard, harmless version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version string assignment with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
