{
  "purpose": "Define constants for HTTP status codes and WebSocket close codes for reference and use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded numeric values representing HTTP and WebSocket status and close codes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or output; constants are static definitions.",
  "flows": "None; the code consists solely of constant assignments without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected; code is static constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of constants for HTTP status codes and WebSocket close codes, referencing official IANA registries and specifications. It imports __future__.annotations, which is benign and often used for forward type annotations. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data interactions are present. The code does not include any logic that could be malicious, such as network communication, credential handling, or data manipulation. It appears to serve as a reference or utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign collection of constant definitions for HTTP and WebSocket codes, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely static data meant for reference purposes.",
