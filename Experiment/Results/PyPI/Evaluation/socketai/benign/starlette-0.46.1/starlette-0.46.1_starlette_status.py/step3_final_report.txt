{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants for HTTP status codes and WebSocket close codes, serving as a reference or utility module for network programming.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it only contains static constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and well-documented. The import of __future__.annotations is unused but harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions for HTTP and WebSocket status codes, with references to official standards. It does not perform any dynamic operations, network communication, or data processing. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present. The import of __future__.annotations is standard for type hinting and does not introduce risk. The static nature and purpose as a reference module mean it cannot be exploited or contain malicious payloads. All reports correctly identify this benign, static nature and assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The scores are consistent with the code's benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static reference module defining protocol constants. No security concerns, malware, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
