  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All five reports agree that the code is solely defining constants for HTTP and WebSocket status/close codes.\n- They note that the code is static, with no input/output, data processing, or dynamic behavior.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The use of `__future__.annotations` is standard and harmless.\n- The purpose appears to be serving as a reference or utility module.\n\n**Confirmation of issues:**\n\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The code is straightforward, static, and well-documented.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n\n- The only minor point is that `from __future__ import annotations` is included but not used anywhere in the code. This is harmless but unnecessary. It does not impact security or functionality.\n\n**Scores review:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature.\n\n**Justification for scores higher than 0.5:**\n\n- No scores need to be increased; the code is purely definitional with no security implications.\n\n**Potential issues with the reports:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They do not assume vulnerabilities or malicious intent beyond the obvious static definitions.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a simple, static set of constants for protocol status codes.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned (all zeros) are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a benign, static reference module defining protocol constants. No security concerns or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, non-malicious, and serves as a straightforward reference for HTTP and WebSocket status codes. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
