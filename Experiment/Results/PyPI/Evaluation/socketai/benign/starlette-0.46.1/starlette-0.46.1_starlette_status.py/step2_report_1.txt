  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code consists solely of static constant definitions for HTTP and WebSocket status and close codes.\n   - No dynamic operations, input/output, data processing, or network communication.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The import of `__future__.annotations` is standard for type hinting and does not introduce any risk.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment; they correctly identify that the code is purely definitional.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The detailed references and comments support the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the static, harmless nature of the code.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1.0), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5; all are zero.\n   - This is justified because the code is purely static, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware scores are all zero, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain any suspicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the static, well-documented nature of the code.\n   - No overreach or unwarranted suspicion is evident.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's static, benign nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a straightforward, static collection of protocol constants with no malicious or security-related issues.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score    | 0.0          | No malicious behavior or payload detected                   |\n| Obfuscated Score | 0.0          | Code is clear, static, and straightforward                   |\n| Risk Score       | 0.0          | No security risk, input, or dynamic behavior present        |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign, static reference module defining protocol constants. No security concerns or malware risks are associated with it.",
