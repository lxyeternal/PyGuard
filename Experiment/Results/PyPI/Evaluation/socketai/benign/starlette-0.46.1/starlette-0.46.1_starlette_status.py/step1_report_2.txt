{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants for HTTP status codes and WebSocket close codes, likely for use in web communication handling.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions for HTTP and WebSocket codes, no external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs; it's purely a set of constant assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The use of __future__ import is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of predefined constants mapping status code names to their numeric values for HTTP and WebSocket protocols. It includes descriptive comments and external references for understanding. No dynamic code, input/output handling, or data processing present. No signs of malicious or suspicious behavior are evident. The constants are straightforward and serve as a reference or lookup, which is common in network programming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless set of constant definitions for protocol status codes, serving as a reference library. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It appears to be a standard, well-structured, and non-malicious code snippet.",
