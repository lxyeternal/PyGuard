  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is purely a static collection of constant definitions for HTTP and WebSocket status codes. There are no dynamic operations, no input/output handling, and no data processing. The code is straightforward and serves as a reference module.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is static, benign, and contains no malicious behavior. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated code, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the static, non-executable nature of the code. The confidence scores are high (mostly 1.0), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely static constant definitions with no dynamic or external interactions, there is no justification for any risk scores above 0.5. The scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   No such claims are made; all reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. They correctly reflect the benign, static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, static set of constant definitions for protocol status codes. It contains no executable logic, no input/output, no external dependencies, and no suspicious patterns. The use of `__future__.annotations` is standard and harmless. There are no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is benign and safe. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
