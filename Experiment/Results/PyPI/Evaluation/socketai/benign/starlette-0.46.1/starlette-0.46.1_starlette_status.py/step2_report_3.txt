  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Purpose**:\n   - The code is purely a static set of constant definitions for HTTP status codes and WebSocket close codes.\n   - It includes references to official standards and documentation.\n   - It imports `__future__.annotations` but does not utilize it, which is harmless and often used for compatibility.\n\n2. **Potential Risks and Malicious Indicators**:\n   - No dynamic code, input/output, network operations, or data processing.\n   - No obfuscated code, suspicious constructs, or hidden behavior.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or code that could be exploited.\n   - The constants serve as a reference library, common in network programming.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is static, straightforward, and benign.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n   - The confidence level is high (1.0), and all agree on zero malware and zero security risk.\n\n4. **Scores Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0.0 is appropriate; no malicious code present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0 is appropriate; code is clear and static.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0.0 is appropriate; no security risks identified.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is only defining constants, it cannot be exploited or used maliciously in isolation.\n   - The import of `__future__.annotations` is benign and standard for compatibility.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n- The code is a harmless, static reference module.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and should remain as is.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware**: 0.0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0.0\n- **Risk**: 0.0\n\n**Final note**: No further action needed. The code is safe and serves a purely documentation/reference purpose.",
