  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is purely a static collection of constant definitions for HTTP and WebSocket status and close codes.\n   - No dynamic operations, input/output, or data processing are present.\n   - The code does not perform any network communication, credential handling, or other potentially risky behavior.\n   - The import of `__future__.annotations` is standard for forward references in type hints and does not introduce any security concern.\n   \n   **Conclusion:** There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is static, harmless, and serves as a reference.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The analysis appropriately dismisses any suspicion of malicious intent or security risks.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1.0), reflecting the clear understanding that the code is harmless.\n\n   **Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is static, contains no dynamic or executable logic, and is purely definitional, higher risk scores are unjustified.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which is correct given the nature of the code.\n   - There is no indication of malicious activity or code that could be exploited.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as a simple constants module.\n   - No suspicious or risky claims are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis that the code is benign.\n   - No discrepancies or inconsistencies are apparent.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward, static set of constant definitions for HTTP and WebSocket status codes.\n- No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:** Given the static nature and purpose of this code, it is safe, benign, and poses no security threat.",
