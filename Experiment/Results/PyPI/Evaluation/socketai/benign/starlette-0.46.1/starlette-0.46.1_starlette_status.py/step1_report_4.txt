  "purpose": "Define constants for HTTP status codes and WebSocket close codes for use in web and network programming.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded constants for HTTP and WebSocket codes",
  "sinks": "No dynamic input, data processing, or data output mechanisms present",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data sources to sinks, as this is solely a constants definition",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated segments, or hidden behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of predefined constants representing HTTP status codes and WebSocket close codes. It includes no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The comments provide references to external standards but do not influence code behavior. The use of '__future__.annotations' is a standard import for forward references in type hints and does not introduce any risk. Overall, this code serves as a static library of constants with no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of constant definitions for HTTP and WebSocket codes. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility module used for clarity and consistency in network-related code.",
