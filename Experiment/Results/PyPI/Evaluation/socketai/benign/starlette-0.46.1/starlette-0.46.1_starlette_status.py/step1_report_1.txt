  "purpose": "Define constants for HTTP and WebSocket status and close codes.",
  "sources": "Constants are hardcoded at the beginning of the file, representing protocol status codes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or processing occurs; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions for HTTP status codes and WebSocket close codes. It imports __future__.annotations but does not use it. There are no dynamic operations, input/output, or data processing. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The structure is clear, and the purpose appears to be purely definitional.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a static reference for protocol codes without any malicious intent or security concerns. It contains no malware, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No security risks identified.",
