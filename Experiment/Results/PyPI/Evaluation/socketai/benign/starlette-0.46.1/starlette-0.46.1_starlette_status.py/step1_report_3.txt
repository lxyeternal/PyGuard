  "purpose": "Define constants for HTTP status codes and WebSocket close codes for reference purposes.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded numeric constants for HTTP and WebSocket status and close codes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or where untrusted input affects system behavior.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of constant definitions for HTTP and WebSocket status codes. There are no data inputs, no processing, no network operations, or any other behavior that could be malicious. The constants are standard and well-documented, serving as reference values for use elsewhere. The code is straightforward and does not perform any operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign, serving as a reference or configuration module for HTTP and WebSocket codes. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
