  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the Python library 'mypy-boto3-s3control'.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static metadata defined in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks that could leak data or execute malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static configuration with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script for Python packaging, importing standard modules, reading a local README file, and calling setup() with static, predefined metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, user inputs, or obfuscated code. All signals indicate a benign, standard package configuration. The reports correctly identify the code as safe, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores set to 0. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these scores, and no anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are accurate and justified, indicating no security concerns.",
