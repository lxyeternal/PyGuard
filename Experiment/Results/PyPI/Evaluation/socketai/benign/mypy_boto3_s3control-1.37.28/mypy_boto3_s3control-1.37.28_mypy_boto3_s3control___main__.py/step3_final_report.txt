{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface that outputs static package information or version number based on user input.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`)",
  "sinks": "Outputs to standard output (`sys.stdout.write`)",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (`--version`) leads to calling `print_version()`, otherwise `print_info()` is called, both writing static text to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is static, straightforward, with no dynamic or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs predefined static information. It reads user input via command-line arguments and writes static text to stdout. There are no external data fetches, network activity, code obfuscation, or secrets. The functions are simple, and the control flow is direct. No malicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is purely informational, and it does not perform any risky operations or contain any suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and safe. It functions solely to display package info and version details without any malicious intent or security risks. All existing reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
