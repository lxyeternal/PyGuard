{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entrypoint for a package that provides information about boto3 S3Control type annotations and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout for output, potentially influenced by command-line inputs (though limited to printing info)",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments (sys.argv) determine whether print_version() or print_info() is called; output flows to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behavior; no unusual code or obfuscation; simple info printing",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI script that prints package info or version based on command-line input. It uses sys and standard output, with no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The functionality is limited to printing static information, and no sensitive data is handled.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility that outputs package and version information. There are no malicious activities, security risks, or anomalies present. It appears to be a simple, well-structured informational script.",
