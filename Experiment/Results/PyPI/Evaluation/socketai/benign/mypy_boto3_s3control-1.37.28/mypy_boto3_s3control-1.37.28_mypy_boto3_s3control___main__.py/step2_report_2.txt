  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI utility that prints static package info or version based on a command-line argument (`--version`).\n   - No dynamic data fetching, no external network activity, no code obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n   - The functions are simple and only output predefined static text.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - All reports consistently identify the code as benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly note the absence of dynamic or external code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No report presents any logical flaws or errors in reasoning.\n   - The analysis aligns well with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0 or very close to 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The only minor security risk score (0.1 in report 3) might be slightly overcautious, but still within reason for a benign script.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - None of the reports justify a high risk score; all are well justified as 0 or near-zero.\n   - The code does not perform any risky operations, so higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the static and straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - Given the code's benign nature, the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risk present.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code is a minimal, static CLI utility with no security concerns.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- No changes needed in the scoring or analysis.\n\n**Summary**: The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores reflect this accurately.",
