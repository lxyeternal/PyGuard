  "purpose": "CLI entry point for printing package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reading command-line arguments), sys.stdout (writing output)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (output display), sys.argv (input via command line)",
  "flows": "Command-line input (--version) triggers print_version, otherwise print_info outputs package details",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code is straightforward, mainly printing static information.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines functions to output static package info and version, and executes based on command-line argument '--version'. There are no external data inputs other than command-line arguments. The output functions write static, non-sensitive data to stdout. No dynamic code execution, no external network activity, and no suspicious logic are present. Overall, the code appears to be a benign CLI utility designed for informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
