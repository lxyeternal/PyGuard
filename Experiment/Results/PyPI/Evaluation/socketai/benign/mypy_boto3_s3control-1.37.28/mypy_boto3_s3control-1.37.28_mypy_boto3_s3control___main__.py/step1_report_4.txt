  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides informational output about boto3 stubs and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout (writes output)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs info and version details)",
  "flows": "User inputs command-line args -> main() checks for '--version' -> outputs version or info to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code solely outputs static information.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and defines three functions: print_info, print_version, and main. print_info outputs static package info and documentation links; print_version outputs a static version number. main() checks if '--version' is in sys.argv; if so, it calls print_version(), otherwise it calls print_info(). The script executes main() if run as main. There are no dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a straightforward CLI utility for informational purposes with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a CLI for printing static package information and version. It does not contain malware or security risks. The script is well-structured and only outputs predefined static text.",
