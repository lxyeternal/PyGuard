  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to stdout using sys.stdout.write().",
  "flows": "User inputs '--version' -> main() detects this -> print_version() outputs version info -> or defaults to print_info() -> outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No use of insecure functions or network operations. Code structure is straightforward and lacks obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script serves as a simple CLI utility that outputs package information or version details based on user input. It reads from sys.argv to determine behavior and writes outputs directly to stdout. No external data sources, network activity, or potentially malicious code segments are present. The code appears clean, purpose-specific, and devoid of any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides package information and version details as expected for a command-line tool.",
