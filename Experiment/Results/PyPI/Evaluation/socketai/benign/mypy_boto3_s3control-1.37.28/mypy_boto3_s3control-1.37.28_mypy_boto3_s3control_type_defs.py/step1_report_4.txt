  "purpose": "Type definitions for s3control service for data validation and structure enforcement in SDK.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and dictionary definitions within the module, including data models, constants, and union types.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points are in functions or processes that might serialize or transmit sensitive data, though none are explicitly present here.",
  "flows": "Data flows are primarily through type structures and data definitions, with no executable logic or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of type annotations, TypedDict definitions, unions, and constants for data modeling. There are no function calls, I/O operations, or executable code that could be malicious. All type definitions adhere to expected patterns for SDK data models. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The module is purely structural, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type definition module used for data validation and SDK type safety, with no malicious or sabotage elements detected.",
