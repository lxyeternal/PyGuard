{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations, data schemas, and constants for the boto3 s3control SDK, serving as static type definitions for validation and type safety.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type annotations, TypedDict definitions, constants, and union types; no runtime data or external data handling.",
  "sinks": "None; the code is purely static type definitions with no data processing, transmission, or external communication.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or execution occurs, only static schema definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations, TypedDicts, union types, and conditional imports based on Python version. It defines data models for API requests and responses without any executable logic, data handling, or network operations. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code appears to be an SDK stub for type safety and validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and contains no malicious or security-related issues. It is a standard set of type definitions for the boto3 s3control SDK, safe for use.",
