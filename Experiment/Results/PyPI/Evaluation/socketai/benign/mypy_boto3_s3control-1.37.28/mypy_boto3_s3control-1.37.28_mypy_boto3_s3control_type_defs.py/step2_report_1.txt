  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue:** \"Empty response\" — no details provided.  \n- **Assessment:** Given the code is solely type annotations and data structure definitions, an \"empty response\" report indicates no suspicious activity or anomalies.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues detected. The code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states the code is for type definitions for boto3 s3control, with no runtime logic.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or transmission occurs; only static type annotations.  \n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Analysis:** Confirmed that the code is purely structural, defining data schemas, request/response models, and union types. No executable code, no external data handling, no malicious patterns.  \n- **Conclusion:** The code is a standard SDK stub, safe and benign.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue:** \"Empty response\" — no details.  \n- **Assessment:** Same as Report 1; no suspicious content.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as previous; data validation and structure enforcement for SDK.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data handling or external communication.  \n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.  \n- **Analysis:** The code is strictly type annotations, data schemas, and constants. No functions, no dynamic code, no signs of malicious intent.  \n- **Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard SDK type definition module.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue:** \"Empty response\" — no details.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation or hiding of intent.  \n- **Security Risks:** The code is purely static type definitions, with no runtime logic, data handling, or external communication.  \n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** No assumptions or vulnerabilities are present.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)  \n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable type definitions)  \n  - **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk, no executable code)\n\n### Justification for scores higher than 0.5:  \nNot applicable here, as the code is entirely benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Overall:** The code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations for SDK data models, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. It is safe for use and poses no security risks.",
