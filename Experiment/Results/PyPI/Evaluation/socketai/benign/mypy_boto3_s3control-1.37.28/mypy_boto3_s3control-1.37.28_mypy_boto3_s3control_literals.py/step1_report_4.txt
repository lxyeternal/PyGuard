{
  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for AWS S3 control service and related enumerations, enabling type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and literal definitions, imported modules (`sys`, `typing`, `typing_extensions`). No external or untrusted data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems; no processing or data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; the code only defines constants and types.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior detected. The code is straightforward, mainly static literal definitions for type annotations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for various string literals used in AWS SDK interactions, conditional importing for compatibility with different Python versions, and a large set of predefined string constants. It is purely declarative, intended for static analysis and IDE support. No dynamic code, network operations, or data handling present. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type definition module for AWS SDK literal types. It appears safe, with no malicious intent or security risks. Its purpose is to facilitate type checking and improve developer experience.",
