  "sinks": "None; no runtime data or external input/output.",
  "flows": "None; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year set to 2025, likely a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS S3Control service parameters, with conditional import for Python version compatibility. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or file operations. The content is purely declarative, serving as type annotations for static analysis and IDE support. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are detected. The only minor anomaly is the future year (2025) in the copyright, which appears to be a placeholder or typo, not security-relevant.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type definitions for AWS SDK literals, with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate safety and correctness.",
