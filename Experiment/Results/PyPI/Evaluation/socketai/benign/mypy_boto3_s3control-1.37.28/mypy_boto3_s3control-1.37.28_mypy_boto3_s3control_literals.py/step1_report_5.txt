  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for AWS S3Control service and related components for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, conditional import for typing.Literal, string literals within type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code only defines literals without runtime data processing or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; the code solely declares static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. The code is purely for type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a docstring explaining the purpose and usage, then imports sys to conditionally import 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version. It defines multiple string literal types used for AWS SDK boto3 stubs, with no runtime logic or data manipulation. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured type declaration module with no malicious intent. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign type definition file for AWS S3Control literals, serving as static type hints for code completion and validation. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
