  "purpose": "Define Python type annotations for AWS S3Control service literal types to improve type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Constant string literals assigned to variables with type Literal, primarily from static type annotations and conditional imports for 'Literal'.",
  "sinks": "None; no input/output or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions without data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of conditional import based on Python version is standard. The module only contains type alias definitions with string literals.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward type annotation module, defining string literal types for AWS S3Control service. It includes a version check for importing 'Literal', which is a common compatibility approach. All variables are simple string literals used for type safety, with no input/output, network activity, or code execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a type annotation utility for AWS SDKs. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements. It provides static type definitions to aid developers and static analysis tools.",
