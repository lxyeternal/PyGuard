  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS s3control service and related types for static type checking.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import sys, and the string literals used in type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that could lead to data leakage or code execution; the code only defines type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is solely type definitions with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be straightforward type annotation definitions without dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then declares multiple type alias variables with string literal types. The content consists exclusively of static type annotations for AWS service parameters, with no input/output handling, no network activity, no credential or secret management, and no code execution. The presence of copyright info and documentation links indicates standard open-source documentation purpose. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of type definitions for static type checking. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its sole purpose is to define string literal types for use elsewhere in type annotations.",
