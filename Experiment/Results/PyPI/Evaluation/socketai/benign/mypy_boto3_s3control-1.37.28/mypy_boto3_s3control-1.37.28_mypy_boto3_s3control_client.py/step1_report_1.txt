  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the s3control service, providing structured access to AWS S3 control operations.",
  "sources": "Constant strings (URLs), import statements, class and method definitions, type annotations, docstrings describing each method, and property declarations.",
  "sinks": "Method calls that invoke AWS SDK operations; parameters including request data (kwargs), and return values such as URLs or dictionaries. No direct data leaks or malicious calls are visible.",
  "flows": "Method parameters (kwargs) flow into SDK operations; responses from SDK calls are returned or processed. No evidence of untrusted data manipulation or external data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of extensive type annotations, docstrings, and method overloads appears standard for SDK stub code. No hardcoded credentials, unusual string manipulations, or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines a client interface for AWS S3 control services, focusing on type safety and documentation. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data handling that could be malicious is present. The structure adheres to typical SDK stub patterns, and all strings are URLs or documentation links. The methods do not perform any actual logic, only type annotations and docstrings. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observable.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type stub and interface definition for AWS S3 control SDK, designed for type checking and documentation. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this source code.",
