  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the boto3 S3Control client, serving as static type stubs for IDE support and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports, class/method signatures, type definitions, docstrings, and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters flow into AWS SDK calls; responses are returned. No data leaks or malicious calls are evident.",
  "flows": "Parameters unpacked into SDK methods; responses returned as annotated types.",
  "anomalies": "Minor anomaly: the copyright year 2025 is in the future, likely a typo; no malicious patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive static type stub for the AWS S3 control SDK, with no executable logic, network activity, or data manipulation. It primarily provides type hints and documentation support. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard SDK interface stub with no malicious intent or security risks. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.",
