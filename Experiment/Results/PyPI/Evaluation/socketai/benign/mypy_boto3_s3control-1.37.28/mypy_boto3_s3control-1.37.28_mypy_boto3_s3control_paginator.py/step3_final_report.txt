  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for boto3 s3control paginators to support static type checking and IDE features.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, method signatures, and type alias imports within the module; no external data sources or runtime input handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; methods return paginator objects, but do not process or transmit external data.",
  "flows": "Class inheritance and method signatures define type flows; no runtime data flow or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations, class wrappers, and conditional imports for compatibility. It does not perform any runtime actions, network communication, or data processing. The structure is standard for SDK stub files, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The use of conditional imports and type aliases aligns with best practices for compatibility and type safety. All signals indicate a benign, well-structured type definition module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate static type annotation and class wrapper setup for boto3 s3control paginators. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with its static, non-executable nature.",
