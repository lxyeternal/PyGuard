  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is solely for type annotations and class definitions related to boto3's s3control paginators. It notes the absence of external inputs, data leaks, or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Fully legitimate, no security concerns.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is for type safety, with no external data or malicious behavior. It highlights the conditional imports and class inheritance structure.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, standard SDK stub code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes that the code is for type annotations, with no network or data processing. It recognizes the use of conditional imports and class extensions.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is identified as type annotation scaffolding with no external data or malicious activity. It mentions the purpose of the classes and methods.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, the code is for static typing and documentation, with no data leaks or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence:** The code is present and correctly analyzed as purely type annotation scaffolding.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's nature.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, which is justified as there's no active or potential security risk.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is legitimate, serving as type annotations for boto3 paginators, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
