  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the s3control service client in boto3, providing typed interfaces for pagination methods.",
  "sources": "Code reads configuration, imports, and type definitions. No external or untrusted input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Code defines classes and methods for pagination; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code mainly involves type annotations and class structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured set of type definitions and class extensions for boto3 paginators, focusing on type safety and documentation. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, and class methods mainly override or extend existing boto3 methods with type annotations. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or harmful code. No external data inputs or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, intended to add type safety and documentation for boto3 s3control paginator classes. No malicious activity or security risks are identified.",
