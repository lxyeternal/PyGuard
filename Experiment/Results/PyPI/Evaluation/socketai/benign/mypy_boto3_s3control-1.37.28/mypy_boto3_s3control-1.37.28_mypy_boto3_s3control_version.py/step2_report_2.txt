  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple, static assignment of a version string (__version__ = \"1.37.28\") with a copyright comment.\n- No input/output, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No untrusted data sources or sinks are identified.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious activity are evident.\n- The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which may be a typo or placeholder but does not impact security.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets are consistent and straightforward.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- All reports assign a security risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and static nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is reasonable given the clear, unambiguous nature of the code.\n\n**Critical review:**\n- There are no logical errors or flaws in the reasoning of the reports.\n- The scores assigned seem appropriate and consistent.\n- The only minor point is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern but could be flagged as a documentation or maintenance issue rather than a security risk.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores across the board are appropriate.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is straightforward, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, static version declaration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not affect security.",
