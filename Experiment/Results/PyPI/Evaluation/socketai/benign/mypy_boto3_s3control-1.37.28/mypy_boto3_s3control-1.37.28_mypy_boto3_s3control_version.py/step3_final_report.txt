  "purpose": "Declare the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of __version__ variable; comment with copyright info.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; static assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year '2025' in comment; no security impact.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static version declaration with a comment. No input, output, dynamic behavior, or external dependencies are present. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected. The only anomaly is the future year '2025' in the comment, which is likely a typo or placeholder and does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscation score 0, and security risk score 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
