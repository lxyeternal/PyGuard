  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the underlying code.\n\n**Code Review:**\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.28\"\n```\n- The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to a variable.\n- The comment and copyright statement are non-executable.\n- No input, output, or dynamic behavior.\n- No obfuscation, no code execution, no external dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and standard for version declaration.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The only notable anomaly is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to the current date (assuming October 2023). This could be a typo, placeholder, or intentional future date, but it does not impact security.\n\n- **Scores review:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 in all reports. Correct, no malicious activity.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0. All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n  - **Security Risk:** 0. All reports correctly assign no security risk.\n\n- **Risk score justification:**\n  All scores are 0 or 1 with confidence 1, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The only anomaly is the copyright year \"2025.\"  \n  **Is this a concern?**  \n  Not from a security perspective. It might be a typo or placeholder, but it doesn't introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here; the code is a standard version declaration.\n- The future year in the copyright is a minor anomaly but not security-relevant.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe version declaration with no security concerns.",
