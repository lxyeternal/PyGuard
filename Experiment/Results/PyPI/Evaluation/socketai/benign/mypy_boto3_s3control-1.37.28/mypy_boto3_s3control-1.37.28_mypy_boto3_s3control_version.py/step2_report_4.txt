  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Contains only a comment (with a copyright statement including the year 2025)\n- Assigns a static string `\"1.37.28\"` to `__version__`\n- No input/output, data flow, or executable logic\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, all reports correctly identify that the code is just a static version declaration.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; all reports agree on benign nature.\n- **Anomalies:** The only anomaly is the future year (2025) in the comment, which could be a typo or placeholder, but not a security concern.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; code is straightforward.\n- **Data flow:** No external data or dynamic code.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-6:**\n- All correctly identify that the code is a simple version assignment.\n- All assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- All assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are 1, indicating certainty.\n\n**Errors or flaws in reasoning:**\n- No errors or flawed reasoning are evident. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are 0, appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or points to challenge:\n- The only anomaly noted is the copyright year 2025. While unusual, it does not pose a security risk. It could be a placeholder or typo, but not malicious.\n- The reports do not consider the future date as a potential indicator of placeholder or placeholder code, but this is minor and not security-relevant.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall,** the code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. The only minor note is the future year in the comment, which does not impact security. No changes needed.",
