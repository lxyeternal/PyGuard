  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is straightforward and standard. No anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a docstring comment about the source of truth for versioning and a single assignment of __version__ to a static string '1.37.28'. No user input, external data, or dynamic execution present. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The copyright notice is a comment and not executable code. Overall, the code appears to be standard version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic version identifier with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a simple version declaration, with no suspicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
