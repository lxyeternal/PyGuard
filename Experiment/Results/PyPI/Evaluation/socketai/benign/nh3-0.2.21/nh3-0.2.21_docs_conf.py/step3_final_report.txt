  "purpose": "Static configuration for Sphinx documentation builder, setting project info, extensions, themes, and paths.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings, list of extensions, theme options, and static paths within the configuration file.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, user input, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured configuration file for Sphinx. It contains no dynamic code, external data fetching, or user input handling. The only external URL is a GitHub link, which is standard. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All parameters are hardcoded, and the code's purpose is clear and benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static and harmless nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration file for documentation generation. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and confidence levels assigned in the reports are appropriate and accurate.",
