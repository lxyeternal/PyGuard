{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the 'nh3' HTML sanitization library, testing various cleaning and validation functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input HTML strings in test cases, including potentially malicious scripts, attributes, and tags.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'nh3.clean' and 'nh3.clean_text' functions that process and sanitize HTML content.",
  "flows": "Input HTML strings are passed to 'nh3.clean' which processes and potentially modifies the content before assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The tests cover sanitization logic, not actual runtime data flow.",
  "analysis": "The code is strictly for testing sanitization functions and does not perform any network, system, or data exfiltration activities. All functions are standard test assertions to verify expected sanitization outputs. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The presence of test cases with malicious-like input (e.g., '<script>alert(\\'hello\\')</script>') is purely for validation of sanitization, not malicious execution. The code does not contain dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks. Overall, it appears to be safe and intended solely for testing the 'nh3' library's security features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of unit tests for an HTML sanitization library. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. It correctly verifies that potentially dangerous HTML is sanitized appropriately, without executing malicious code or leaking data.",
