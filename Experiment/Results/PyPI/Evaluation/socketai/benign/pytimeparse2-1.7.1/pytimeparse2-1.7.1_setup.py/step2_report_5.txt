  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the described sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, and overall context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The script is a setup utility for packaging/distribution, reading environment variables, command-line args, filesystem, and external modules.\n- **Sinks:** External commands (`subprocess`), file operations during minification, and release via `github_release`.\n- **Flows:** Data from env/args influences subprocess/network actions; filesystem operations during build/install.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of subprocess to run 'yarn', dynamic import of 'github_release', filesystem modifications, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis:** Standard build script with extension compilation, static file minification, and optional GitHub release. No malicious code, backdoors, or exfiltration. Subprocess calls are typical for build steps. External modules are used appropriately.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate build script, no signs of malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.3 (moderate, due to subprocess and external module use).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low malware score aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The risk score is reasonable given external subprocess calls, but nothing malicious is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar build and release functions, reading args, env, files.\n- **Sinks:** Subprocess, file modifications, network interactions.\n- **Flows:** Influenced by args/env; filesystem reads/writes; subprocess calls.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of subprocess to run 'yarn', dynamic module import, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above—standard build process, no malicious payloads. External commands are typical in build pipelines.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (low, standard build process).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The low malware score is justified. The risk is minimal, considering the subprocess calls are typical.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Packaging setup, reading command-line args, env, files.\n- **Sinks:** Subprocess calls, file operations, external modules.\n- **Flows:** Data from args/env influence build steps.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of subprocess to run 'yarn', dynamic import of modules, no secrets.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity. The subprocess calls are part of build automation.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (appropriate).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No malicious behavior is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Building/distributing, extension compilation, release.\n- **Sinks:** Subprocess, file deletion, network via github_release.\n- **Flows:** Command-line/env influence; filesystem and external commands.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of subprocess to run 'yarn', no hardcoded secrets, typical build steps.\n- **Analysis:** Standard build script with external build tools. No malicious activity or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate build and release process.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The subprocess calls are standard, and no malicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Building, packaging, release, reading args, env, files.\n- **Sinks:** Subprocess, file operations, network interactions.\n- **Flows:** Inputs influence build/release; filesystem operations.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of subprocess to run 'yarn', no secrets, typical build automation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent. The subprocess calls for frontend build steps are common in complex packages.\n- **Conclusion:** The script is a legitimate build and release utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low (~0.1-0.3), reflecting the use of subprocess calls and external modules, which are typical in build scripts but could pose some security considerations if environment is compromised.\n\n### **My Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** ~0.1 to 0.2 (standard build processes with external commands, no secrets or suspicious patterns)\n\n**Note:** The use of subprocess to run 'yarn' commands and dynamic module imports are typical in complex build scripts but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. The code is consistent with legitimate build, extension compilation, minification, and release automation.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and well-justified. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured setup script with no malicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
