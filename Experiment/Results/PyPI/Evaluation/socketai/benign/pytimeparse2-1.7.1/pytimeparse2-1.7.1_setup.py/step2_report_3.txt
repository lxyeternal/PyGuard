  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the reasoning provided.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a build/setup utility for 'pytimeparse2' with extension compilation, static file minification, and optional GitHub release. No malicious code detected; subprocess calls are standard.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  Justified. No malicious activity observed.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  The code is clear, not obfuscated.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.3  \n  Slightly elevated due to subprocess calls and external module use, but overall low.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The subprocess calls to 'yarn' and dynamic imports are typical in build scripts. No signs of malicious activity or backdoors.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on build, static minification, and release. No malicious activity, external commands are standard.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  Justified. No malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  Code is transparent.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2  \n  Slightly higher but still low, due to subprocess and external modules.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores and conclusion are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on setup configuration, extension compilation, and release. No malicious code or backdoors.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  Correct. No malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  Code is straightforward.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2  \n  Low, mainly because of subprocess and external modules.\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The script is a standard build setup.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing build, compile, and release features. No malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  Justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  Clear code.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2  \n  Slightly elevated but acceptable.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring and conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Comprehensive build and release setup, including optional extensions and external commands. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  Correct.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  Code is transparent.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1  \n  Very low, typical for build scripts.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is solid. No malicious indicators.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, which is accurate given the code clarity.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.3) due to the use of subprocesses and external modules, but these are standard in build scripts.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The subprocess calls to 'yarn' and dynamic module imports are typical for complex build systems and do not inherently indicate malicious activity.\n\n- The external module 'github_release' is used for release automation, which is common.\n\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are present.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to reflect the use of subprocess and external modules, but overall low risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured build and release script with no malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
