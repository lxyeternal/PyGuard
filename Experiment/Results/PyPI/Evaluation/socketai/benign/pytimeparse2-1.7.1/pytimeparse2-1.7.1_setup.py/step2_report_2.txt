  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the described sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, and overall logic.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Build script for packaging/distribution.\n- Sources: Environment variables, command-line args, filesystem.\n- Sinks: External commands, file writes, network during GitHub release.\n- Anomalies: Use of subprocess for yarn, dynamic import of 'github_release'.\n- Analysis: Standard build script, no malicious code, typical external command execution.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.3 (some external command execution, but standard)\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the script is a build utility with external subprocess calls, which could be risky if environment is compromised, but no malicious intent or malware is evident. The use of subprocess to run 'yarn' is typical for building assets, not malicious. The dynamic import of 'github_release' is for release automation, which is legitimate.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nScores seem reasonable. Malware: 0 is justified. Security risk is moderate but not high.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Build, package, release.\n- Sources: CLI args, env vars, filesystem.\n- Sinks: subprocess, file modifications, github_release.\n- Anomalies: Subprocess calls to yarn, dynamic modules, no hardcoded secrets.\n- Analysis: Typical build process, no evidence of malicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code. The subprocess calls to 'yarn' are part of frontend asset building, common in web projects. No malicious activity is detected.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nScores are reasonable; malware: 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Setup for packaging.\n- Sources: CLI args, env vars, files.\n- Sinks: subprocess, file operations, github_release.\n- Anomalies: External module import, subprocess calls.\n- Analysis: Standard build setup, no malicious code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code's behavior is consistent with a build script. No suspicious patterns or malicious logic are evident.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nScores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Setup for building/distribution.\n- Sources: CLI args, env vars, files.\n- Sinks: subprocess, file operations, github_release.\n- Anomalies: Use of 'yarn' commands, external modules.\n- Analysis: Typical build pipeline, no malicious intent.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the subprocess calls to 'yarn' are standard for frontend assets. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nScores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Build, package, release.\n- Sources: CLI args, env vars, files.\n- Sinks: subprocess, file, github_release.\n- Anomalies: Complex conditional logic, external commands.\n- Analysis: Standard build script, no malicious code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is typical for a complex setup script. No malicious patterns or backdoors are detected.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nScores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, the code is readable and straightforward.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly varying but generally low, reflecting the use of subprocess and external modules, which are standard in build scripts.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.3 (some external command execution, but typical for build scripts)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. The code is a legitimate build and release script with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The external subprocess calls and dynamic module imports are standard for such scripts, and no suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to suggest any further actions or detailed risk assessments?**",
