  "purpose": "A utility to parse various human-readable and ISO-like time expressions into seconds or timedelta objects.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns matching time formats, input string parameter to parse.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to files, network, or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex matching -> extraction of time components -> conversion to seconds or timedelta.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in variable name 'HAS_RELITIVE_TIMEDELTA' (should be 'HAS_RELATIVE_TIMEDELTA'), but it does not affect functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard utility for parsing time expressions. It uses regex for pattern matching, optional 'dateutil' dependency for extended timedelta calculations, and handles exceptions gracefully. No network, file I/O, or malicious code is present. The regex patterns are appropriate for typical formats. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are detected. The purpose is solely to interpret time strings into numeric or timedelta representations. The typo in the variable name is minor and does not impact security or functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented time parsing utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.",
