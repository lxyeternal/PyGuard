  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for SVN command errors.",
  "sources": "No data inputs, external calls, or data flows; class definition only.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; straightforward class inheritance without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; simple class with docstring and pass statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard pattern for defining a custom exception in Python. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The class is solely for error handling related to SVN commands. No data sources, sinks, or suspicious logic are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no malicious intent or security concerns. All existing reports and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
