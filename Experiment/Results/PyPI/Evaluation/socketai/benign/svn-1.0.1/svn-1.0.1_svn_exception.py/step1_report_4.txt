  "sources": "No input or data sources; class definition only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as this is a simple class declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; straightforward exception subclass with docstring.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with a descriptive docstring. It contains no executable code, data handling, or external interactions. There are no hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, and no suspicious behaviors. The class is a standard pattern for error handling in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign class definition for exception handling related to SVN errors. No malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation detected.",
