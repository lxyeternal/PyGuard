  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - The code contains only a docstring and a `pass` statement.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the code is benign.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (high confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n   - No justification for higher scores is needed.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and correctly state that the code is a simple exception class.\n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — No security risk or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign class definition for a custom exception. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security issues.\n\n**Conclusion**: No changes needed. The code is safe and unremarkable from a security perspective.",
