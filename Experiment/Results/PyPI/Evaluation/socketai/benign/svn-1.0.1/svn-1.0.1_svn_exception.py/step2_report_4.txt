  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception inheriting from `Exception`. There are no data inputs, external calls, or complex logic. The code is benign and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n- obfuscated: 0\n- malware: 0\n- securityRisk: 0\n\nThese scores seem appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports agree on zero malware and security risk, and the code is just a class definition, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The code does not perform any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not contain any malicious logic, payloads, or suspicious constructs.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid speculative claims. They base their assessments on the actual code content, which is straightforward.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign class definition with no security concerns.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a simple, clear custom exception class intended for SVN command errors. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as they are: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
