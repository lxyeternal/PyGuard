  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for SVN command errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or outputs that could lead to data leaks",
  "flows": "No data flow since the class is only a simple exception definition",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code activities; straightforward exception class",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Exception to represent errors from SVN CLI commands. It contains a docstring explaining its purpose and a 'pass' statement, indicating no additional logic or data handling. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows present. The implementation appears standard and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic custom exception class with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It does not read untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain any suspicious code.",
