  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for SVN-related errors",
  "sources": "No input or data sources in the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or output",
  "flows": "No data flow; the class does not process or transfer data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward class definition",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class inheriting from Exception, intended to be raised when an SVN CLI command fails. There are no data inputs, external calls, or suspicious constructs present. It contains only standard class definition syntax with a docstring and a pass statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign class definition with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
