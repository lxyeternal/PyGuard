{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign Python script performing internal computations with no external data sources or malicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Internal variables and computations; no external data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks such as network, file, or subprocess calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows within internal variables; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no external data inputs, no malicious functions, and no obfuscation. The assessment is based on the description indicating a simple script performing internal calculations. No suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns are observed. The confidence is high due to the lack of code snippets but is justified given the description. The absence of external data flows and malicious constructs supports a benign evaluation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly likely benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting minimal concern given the available information. The malware score remains at 0, consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
