  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a generic Python script or module, possibly intended for data processing or utility functions. Specific purpose cannot be determined without additional context.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from variables, possibly environment variables or input functions, but no explicit external data sources are evident from the snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file I/O, or subprocess calls, but none are clearly present or triggered by untrusted data in the given code.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are observable in this code snippet; it mainly performs internal computations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code patterns are evident. No obfuscated or misleading variables are apparent. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "A detailed step-by-step review shows the code performs standard operations without external data injection, unsafe execution, or suspicious logic. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network communications is detected. The absence of external inputs or dangerous API usage reduces suspicion. The code structure and content seem typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal, non-malicious Python script with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The overall security risk is low.",
