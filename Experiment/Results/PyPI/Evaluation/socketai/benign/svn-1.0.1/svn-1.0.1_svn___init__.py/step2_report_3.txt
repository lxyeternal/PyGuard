  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is simply assigning a string `'1.0.1'` to the variable `__version__`.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external data sources, or complex logic.\n   - The code is a standard practice for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No reports indicate any obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious behavior.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws are present.\n   - The code is minimal and straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n4. **Score Justification & Recommendations:**\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, as expected.\n   - The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n5. **Potential for Reassessment:**\n   - Since the code is trivial and standard, there is no reason to increase any scores.\n   - The reports are aligned with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code snippet is a typical version declaration in a Python package. It is harmless, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The current assessments accurately reflect the benign nature of this code.",
