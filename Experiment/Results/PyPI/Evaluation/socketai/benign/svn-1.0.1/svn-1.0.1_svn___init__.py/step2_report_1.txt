  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the underlying code:\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\n__version__ = '1.0.1'\n```\n\n**Assessment of the Code:**\n- The code is a straightforward assignment of a string to a variable named `__version__`.\n- This is a common pattern in Python packages to specify version information.\n- There are no input/output operations, no data processing, no external data sources or sinks.\n- The code contains no obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious intent.\n- No complex control flow, no embedded scripts, or dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Reports 1-5** all describe the same minimal snippet, emphasizing:\n- No data sources or sinks.\n- No data flow or processing.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code is a standard version declaration.\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n- Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Logical consistency:**\n- These assessments are accurate; the code is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a version string. There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:**  \n  No errors are apparent; the reasoning is sound.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n- **Malware and obfuscated scores:**  \n  Both are correctly set to 0, as there's no indication of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:**  \n  No assumptions are made beyond the code snippet; the conclusions are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the code's benign nature, should stay at **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\nThe code is a minimal, standard version declaration typical in Python packages. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. There are no indications of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the code's actual content.",
