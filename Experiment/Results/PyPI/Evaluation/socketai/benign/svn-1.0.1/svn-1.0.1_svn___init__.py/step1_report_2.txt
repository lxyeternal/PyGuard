  "purpose": "Declare the version of the package or module as '1.0.1'.",
  "sources": "Assignment of a string value to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns a version string to a special variable __version__, which is a common practice in Python packages for version tracking. There are no sources of untrusted input, no sinks that handle sensitive data, and no complex control flow or obfuscation. This minimal code fragment appears benign and typical of package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
