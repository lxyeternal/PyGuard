  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable. There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or complex logic. This is standard practice in Python packages for versioning.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Anomalies**  \nAll reports agree that there are no anomalies, suspicious constructs, or signs of obfuscation. The code is minimal and benign.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious intent or behavior.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that this code fragment is harmless and standard. There are no logical flaws or assumptions that could be challenged here.\n\n5. **Overall Risk Assessment**  \nGiven the uniform agreement and the nature of the code, I concur with the assessments:  \n- Malware Score: 0  \n- Obfuscated Score: 0  \n- Security Risk Score: 0\n\n**Final Recommendations:**  \n- The scores are appropriate; no changes needed.  \n- The code is a typical version declaration, posing no security threat.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's characteristics.",
