The main security concern is ensuring that 'run_command' properly sanitizes inputs to prevent command injection. Given the information, the malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3, depending on input sanitization practices."

The low risk score of 0.2 is justified by the potential command injection risk if inputs are not sanitized, but no malicious intent is evident. The malware and obfuscated scores are zero, reflecting the code's transparency and safety."
