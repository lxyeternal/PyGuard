  "purpose": "Set the console encoding based on an environment variable or default value.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get('SVN_COMMAND_OUTPUT_ENCODING')",
  "sinks": "No direct data leaks or external system calls; setting a variable based on environment data.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'SVN_COMMAND_OUTPUT_ENCODING' influences the value of CONSOLE_ENCODING.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets beyond a default encoding, and no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a default encoding string and then assigns a value to CONSOLE_ENCODING based on an environment variable. This pattern is common for configurable parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The environment variable usage is standard for configuration. No input validation or unsafe operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration snippet for setting console encoding based on an environment variable, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
