  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code simply reads environment variable with default fallback",
  "analysis": "The code sets a default encoding and allows an environment variable to override it. No malicious code or suspicious behavior is present. No data leaks or malicious flows identified. The code is straightforward and intended for configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration snippet used to determine console encoding with an environment variable override. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
