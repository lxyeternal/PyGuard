  "purpose": "Read environment variable 'SVN_COMMAND_OUTPUT_ENCODING' with a default fallback for setting console encoding.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SVN_COMMAND_OUTPUT_ENCODING' accessed via os.environ.get.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to CONSOLE_ENCODING; no untrusted data used in critical operations.",
  "flows": "Environment variable read -> assigned to CONSOLE_ENCODING.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines a default encoding, and assigns CONSOLE_ENCODING based on an environment variable. No malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are present. The environment variable is used solely for configuration, which is standard practice. No logical errors or security flaws are identified. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration pattern for setting console encoding, with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify it as safe. The environment variable usage is standard and poses no threat.",
