  "purpose": "Set the console encoding based on an environment variable or default to 'en_US.UTF-8'",
  "sources": "Reading the environment variable 'SVN_COMMAND_OUTPUT_ENCODING' via os.environ.get",
  "sinks": "Assignment to the variable CONSOLE_ENCODING",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'SVN_COMMAND_OUTPUT_ENCODING' influences the value of CONSOLE_ENCODING",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward environment variable access and default assignment",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module to access environment variables. It sets a default encoding string and then attempts to override it with a value from the environment variable 'SVN_COMMAND_OUTPUT_ENCODING' if present. This is a typical pattern for configurable settings. No suspicious or malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present. No data leaks or malicious side effects are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and safe, configuring console encoding with user-controllable environment variable. No malicious intent or security issues identified.",
