  "anomalies": "None",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module, sets a default encoding string, and then assigns CONSOLE_ENCODING to the value of an environment variable if it exists, otherwise defaults. The environment variable is accessed in a straightforward manner without manipulation or evaluation. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code simply manages configuration for console output encoding, which is a common pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign and standard for configuration purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
