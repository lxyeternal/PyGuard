{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python package setup script that reads static resource files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') from within the 'svn' package directory and uses setuptools to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'resources/README.md' and 'resources/requirements.txt' files within the 'svn' package directory, and imports the 'svn' module to access its version and file path.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static files are read from package directory, and package setup is performed without external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads static resource files from within the package directory; no dynamic or external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'svn' to determine resource paths and version, reads static files, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The resource files are static and part of the package. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The 'malware' score is correctly 0, and the 'securityRisk' score is minimal (0 or 0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the script. The reliance on 'svn' package's integrity is outside this code's scope but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and the overall risk is negligible.",
