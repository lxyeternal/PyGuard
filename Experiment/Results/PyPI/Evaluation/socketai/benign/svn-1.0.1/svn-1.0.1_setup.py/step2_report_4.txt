  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is observed.\n- The code reads static resource files and configures package metadata.\n- The 'svn' module is imported solely to retrieve its version and determine resource paths.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No malicious sinks; straightforward data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; it's a standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing benignity.\n- **Scores:** Same as above, fully justified.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Slightly higher `securityRisk` score (0.1), justified by cautious language.\n- **Malware score:** 0, aligns with analysis.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly conservative but acceptable. No actual risk detected.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Similar reasoning, standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Same conclusion, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** all zero or minimal, matching the benign analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is a straightforward setup script.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** Both are correctly scored as zero.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero in one report (0.1), but given the code's nature, this is a conservative estimate; it could be zero.\n- **Confidence:** All reports have high confidence (1), which is justified.\n\n### **Potential Adjustments:**\n- The `securityRisk` score could be uniformly set to **0**, as there's no actual security concern.\n- The `malware` and `obfuscated` scores are correctly assigned as 0.\n- The overall assessment should reflect that this is a benign, standard setup script.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified; reading static files and setting up package metadata is safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or obfuscated content, and the scores are appropriate. I would recommend setting all scores to zero for malware and obfuscated, and zero or near-zero for security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|--------------|---------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0             |\n\nThis reflects the code's benign nature and the absence of any security concerns.",
