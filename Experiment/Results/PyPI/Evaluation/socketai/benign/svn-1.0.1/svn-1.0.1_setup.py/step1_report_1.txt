{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'svn' by reading resource files and configuring package metadata using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md and requirements.txt files from the 'resources' directory within the 'svn' package directory.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data; no direct sinks for malicious activity are present.",
  "flows": "Reads long description and requirements from files; supplies metadata to setuptools.setup() for package creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward use of standard library and setuptools with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup procedures for a Python package, including reading static resource files and configuring package metadata. It imports 'svn' to determine the package path and reads description and requirements files. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling beyond reading static files, or external data transmissions. The code structure is standard and clean, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
