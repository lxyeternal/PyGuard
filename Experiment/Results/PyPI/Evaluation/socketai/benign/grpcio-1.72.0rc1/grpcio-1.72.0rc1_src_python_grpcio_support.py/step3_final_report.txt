  "purpose": "Diagnostics and environment validation for Python C extension compilation, including header checks and error diagnosis.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, source files, and C code snippets; uses compiler.compile() to compile C code.",
  "sinks": "Compilation process and error messages; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Source code (C snippets) is compiled via compiler.compile(); errors are handled and diagnostic messages are output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; standard build diagnostics.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment checks, compiles temporary C snippets to verify headers, and provides error diagnostics. It uses standard libraries and practices for build validation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is present. Error handling and messaging are typical for build scripts. The purpose aligns with standard build environment validation for Python C extensions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard build environment diagnostic utility for Python C extensions, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and benign nature.",
