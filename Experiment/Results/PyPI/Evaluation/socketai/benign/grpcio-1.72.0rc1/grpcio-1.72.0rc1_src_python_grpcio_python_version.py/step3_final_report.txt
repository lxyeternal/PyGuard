  "purpose": "Static configuration defining supported Python versions and version bounds for a package.",
  "sources": "Constant variable assignments for SUPPORTED_PYTHON_VERSIONS, MIN_PYTHON_VERSION, MAX_PYTHON_VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data handling; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static data only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is auto-generated configuration with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static configuration snippet with no dynamic behavior, input handling, or external communication. It contains only variable assignments specifying supported Python versions and constraints. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code is well-structured, with licensing headers, and is typical for auto-generated configuration files. Given the absence of any suspicious or malicious elements, the code poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static configuration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All signals, including malware and obfuscation scores, are zero, and the security risk is minimal. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
