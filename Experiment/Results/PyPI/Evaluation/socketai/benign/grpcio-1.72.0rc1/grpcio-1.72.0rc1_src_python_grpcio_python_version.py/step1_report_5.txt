{
  "purpose": "Define supported Python versions and minimum/maximum version constraints for a gRPC Python package.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; the code consists of static variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths present, as the code only assigns static lists and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be auto-generated metadata with no suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code simply specifies supported Python versions and version bounds for a package. It is auto-generated and contains no user input, external data sources, or potentially dangerous code constructs. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior indicators are present. The structure is straightforward and consistent with configuration or metadata files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for defining supported Python versions, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
