  "analysis": "The code simply declares static configuration variables specifying supported Python versions and version bounds. It is auto-generated, with no input handling, data processing, or external communications. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious logic are present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for version compatibility checks, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
