  "sources": "Constants defining supported Python versions, minimum, and maximum version variables.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static lists and variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static configuration data, specifying supported Python versions for the project. It is auto-generated boilerplate code with licensing headers and version lists. No input handling, no untrusted data sources, and no sensitive data processing. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as configuration metadata for supported Python versions. There are no security risks or malicious behaviors present.",
