  "purpose": "Define supported Python versions and minimum/maximum version constraints for a gRPC package.",
  "sources": "Constant list SUPPORTED_PYTHON_VERSIONS and version variables MIN_PYTHON_VERSION and MAX_PYTHON_VERSION.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, and contains only version definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code specifies supported Python versions and version constraints for the package. It is auto-generated and only contains static data without any user input, external data fetching, or dynamic execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. The code does not perform any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as configuration for supported Python versions. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risk.",
