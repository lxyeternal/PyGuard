  "purpose": "Define supported Python versions and minimum/maximum version constraints for a package.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs; static configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow as the code consists of static variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple configuration snippet generated from a template, specifying supported Python versions and constraints. It contains only static data declarations with no dynamic execution, input handling, or external data access. The comments indicate licensing and autogenerated status but do not suggest malicious intent. The code does not include any potentially harmful constructs or obfuscated patterns. Overall, the code appears to be a standard configuration file with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration snippet defining supported Python versions. It does not contain malware, security risks, or anomalies. No malicious behavior or security threats are detected.",
