  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a static assignment of a version string (`VERSION = '1.72.0rc1'`) with licensing comments.\n   - The code is auto-generated, with no input/output, data processing, or dynamic behavior.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - Given the code's simplicity and purpose, it is highly unlikely to contain malware.\n   - The reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 across all reports.\n   - No claims or evidence suggest malicious activity.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Flaws:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no security risks.\n   - The purpose is straightforward: defining a version string for package identification.\n   - No anomalies, such as obfuscation or suspicious code, are present.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification:**\n   - The confidence scores are all at 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - The malware score is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - The security risk score is 0, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - Since all reports are consistent and accurate, no adjustments are necessary.\n   - The overall assessment aligns with the code's purpose and content.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, auto-generated version string declaration with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric            | Final Score |\n|-------------------|--------------|\n| Malware           | 0            |\n| Obfuscated        | 0            |\n| Security Risk     | 0            |\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
