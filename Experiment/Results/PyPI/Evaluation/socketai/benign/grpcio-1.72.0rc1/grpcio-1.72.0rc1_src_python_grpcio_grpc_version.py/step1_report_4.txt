  "anomalies": "The code is auto-generated; no unusual behavior or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple auto-generated file that assigns a version string to a variable. It contains license and license-related comments but no executable logic, input handling, or data processing. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The only noteworthy aspect is that it is auto-generated, which is common in build or version management scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves a straightforward purpose of defining a version constant for the package. There is no malicious intent or security concern present.",
