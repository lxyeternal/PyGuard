  "purpose": "Define and store the version string for the gRPC Python library.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded assignment to the variable VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; the code simply assigns a string to a variable.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only initializes a version string.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious or unusual code behaviors. The code appears auto-generated, but that is standard for version files.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, auto-generated version declaration with licensing comments. There are no inputs, no data processing, no network or environment variable use, and no potentially malicious code. It is a standard version header for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version indicator. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
