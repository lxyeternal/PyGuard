  "purpose": "This code defines a static version string for the gRPC library, serving as package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, auto-generated, with licensing comments and a version string.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated Python file that assigns a version string to a variable. It contains licensing comments and no dynamic behavior, input/output operations, or external dependencies. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code serves solely as package metadata and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a version identifier with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
