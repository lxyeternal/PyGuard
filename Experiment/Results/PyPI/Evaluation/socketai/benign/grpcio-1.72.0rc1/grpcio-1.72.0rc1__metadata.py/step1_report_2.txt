  "purpose": "Metadata information indicating version of the gRPC library and licensing details.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; the code defines a version string.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; only static assignment of version string.",
  "anomalies": "Code is auto-generated metadata with license comments; no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments, license information, and a version string assignment. There are no operations, data processing, or external interactions. The version string appears to be a static value indicating the release candidate version of the library. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, auto-generated metadata file containing licensing and version information. No security threats, malware, or obfuscation are present.",
