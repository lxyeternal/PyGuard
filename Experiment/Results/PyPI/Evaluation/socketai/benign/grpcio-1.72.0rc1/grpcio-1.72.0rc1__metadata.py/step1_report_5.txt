  "anomalies": "Presence of a version string indicating a pre-release (rc1), but no anomalies related to malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a version string to a variable, with licensing comments. There are no inputs, data processing, or external interactions. It appears to be a standard, auto-generated metadata file. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward metadata assignment with licensing comments. No malicious activity or security issues are detected.",
