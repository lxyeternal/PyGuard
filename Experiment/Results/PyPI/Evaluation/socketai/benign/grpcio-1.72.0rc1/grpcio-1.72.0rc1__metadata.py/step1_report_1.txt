  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for a Python package, indicating version information.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable from a hardcoded string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment of version string.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of auto-generated comment and license headers, but no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments, license information, and a single variable assignment setting the __version__ variable. It appears to be a standard metadata file, likely auto-generated, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscated code. No external inputs, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, metadata-only code fragment providing package version information. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
