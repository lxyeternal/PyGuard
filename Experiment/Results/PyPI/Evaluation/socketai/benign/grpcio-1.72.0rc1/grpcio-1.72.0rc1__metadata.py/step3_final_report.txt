  "purpose": "Metadata declaration of package version and licensing information.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ and license comments.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment without external input.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, auto-generated metadata code.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only comments and a static version string assignment, typical for package metadata. No dynamic code, input/output, or network activity is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, metadata-only, and auto-generated. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected. The version string '1.72.0rc1' indicates a release candidate but does not impact security assessment. The high confidence scores reflect certainty in benign nature. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign metadata file with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's content.",
