{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup/build configuration script for the gRPC Python package, managing dependencies, environment variables, and build flags, with routine file copying for credentials.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for build options, subprocess calls for linker feature detection, file copying of 'roots.pem' for credentials.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls for system feature checks, copying of credential files, macro definitions based on environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence build macros and flags; subprocess calls perform system checks; credential files are copied during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no network activity. Use of subprocess for build checks is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard build configuration tasks: environment variable parsing, platform-specific flags, dependency inclusion, and credential setup. Subprocess calls are used for system feature detection, which is common in build scripts. Credential copying from static paths is routine. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign and routine nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build setup script with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate. Minor environmental manipulations are typical in build processes and do not indicate malicious intent.",
