  "purpose": "Static list of source files and assembly files used as dependencies in the gRPC core library, including cryptographic and networking components. No executable code or runtime data is present.",
  "sources": "Predefined file paths and assembly routines, no runtime input or data flows.",
  "sinks": "None; static dependency listing without data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; purely a manifest of source files and assembly routines.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation detected; files are standard cryptographic and system utility components.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated dependency manifest listing source files for core gRPC components, cryptography, and third-party libraries. It contains no executable logic, user input, or runtime data flows. Assembly files are for performance optimization and are common in cryptographic libraries. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: very low) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the dependency list.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency list is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated code. The current scores are appropriate and justified given the static, dependency-only content. No security risks or malware indicators are evident.",
