  ],
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward test code designed to verify SDK behavior under multithreaded conditions with asynchronous credentials. It uses hardcoded secrets typical for local emulator testing, which pose security risks if exposed outside controlled environments. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The malware score is correctly zero, indicating no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is zero, consistent with clear code. The security risk score is moderate (around 0.3-0.4), reflecting the presence of static secrets, which should be replaced with environment variables or secure vaults in production. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior but highlights best practices for secret management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate testing code with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The primary concern is the use of hardcoded credentials, which should be replaced with secure management practices for production. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.4), mainly due to embedded secrets.",
