  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate testing code with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The primary concern is the use of hardcoded credentials, which should be replaced with secure management practices for production. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.4), mainly due to embedded secrets."
