{
  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to manage versioning without manual changes.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables; no external input or data reading sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leakage or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization of version variables from hardcoded version string to tuple and back.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional type checking for type hints, no malicious or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version-related variables using hardcoded version info, with conditional type annotations for type hints. No external data sources, no untrusted data flows, no suspicious behaviors, or malicious logic. The structure is straightforward and typical for version management in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, solely related to version information definition, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
