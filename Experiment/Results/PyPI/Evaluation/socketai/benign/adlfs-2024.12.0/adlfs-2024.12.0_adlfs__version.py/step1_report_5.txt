{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and manages version-related variables.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the __version__, version, __version_tuple__, and version_tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is being sent or used in a way that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Direct assignment of version strings and tuples to module-level variables; no untrusted data sources or data flow logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward auto-generated version management snippet created by setuptools_scm. It includes conditional type checking logic that imports type hints if TYPE_CHECKING is true, which is standard practice. The version information is hardcoded to '2024.12.0' and its tuple form. No external inputs, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The structure and content are typical for package versioning files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration snippet with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It simply manages version metadata for a Python package.",
