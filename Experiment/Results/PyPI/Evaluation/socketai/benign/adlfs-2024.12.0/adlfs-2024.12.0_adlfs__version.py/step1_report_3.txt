{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to manage package versioning.",
  "sources": "The code sets version variables directly within the script, including version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks, external communications, or inputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code assigns static version information to variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no unusual constructs, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. It explicitly states it is generated by a version control tool and does not perform any operations beyond variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple generated file setting package version variables. It includes conditional type checking imports, which are standard in type annotations, and assigns fixed version strings and tuples. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or suspicious operations. The content aligns with typical auto-generated version files for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves solely to store version information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present.",
