{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, for tracking the package version.",
  "sources": "Variables '__version__', 'version', '__version_tuple__', and 'version_tuple' assigned static version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; no sinks that could leak data or execute code.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version strings to version variables; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no unusual or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily assigns static version information to variables for package identification. It uses a conditional based on TYPE_CHECKING, which is standard practice for type hinting. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation is present. The code appears to be auto-generated by setuptools_scm, a common version management tool. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration file with no malicious intent or security concerns. It simply assigns version information to variables, with no suspicious or harmful behavior.",
