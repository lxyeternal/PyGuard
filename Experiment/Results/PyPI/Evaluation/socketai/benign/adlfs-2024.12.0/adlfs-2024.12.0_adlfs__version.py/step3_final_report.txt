  "sinks": "None; static data assignments with no untrusted input or data flow.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward auto-generated version info.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static version declaration with conditional type hint imports. It contains no dynamic code, external inputs, network activity, or obfuscation. All assessments correctly identify its benign nature. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, with full confidence. No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard version info generated by setuptools_scm, with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
