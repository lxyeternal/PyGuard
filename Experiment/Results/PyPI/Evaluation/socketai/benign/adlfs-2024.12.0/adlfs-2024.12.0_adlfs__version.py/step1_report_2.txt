  "purpose": "Define version information for a package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple, importing type hints conditionally.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The version is statically assigned and not dynamically fetched or transmitted.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports type hints for type checking, which is standard practice. The version variables are hardcoded as strings and tuples, with no input handling, external network access, or data leaks. It is generated by setuptools_scm and appears to be purely for version tracking. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version definition file generated automatically; it contains no malicious intent, no external data handling, and no security risks.",
