{
  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for Azure storage classes and attempts to import version information, handling import errors gracefully.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.gen1, .spec, and ._version) and the module's own namespace.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data is processed or output in a way that affects security.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly sets module exports and handles version info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; the version import is standard practice with fallback.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from local modules and defines the public API via __all__. It attempts to import version info from a local _version module, and if that fails, sets defaults. The structure and logic are straightforward, with no obfuscated or unusual constructs. The code lacks any suspicious behavior, external network activity, or malicious code indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup with version handling. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident based on this snippet.",
