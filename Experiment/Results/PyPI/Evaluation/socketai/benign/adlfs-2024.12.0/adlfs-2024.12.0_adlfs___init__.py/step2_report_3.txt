  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard module setup, primarily handling imports, exports, and version info.\n- No report mentions any external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code snippets are typical for Python package initialization files (__init__.py), with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The scores for malware and obfuscated code are consistently zero, aligning with the reports' assessments.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Issues in the Code:\n- The code **does not** contain any malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious logic.\n- The version import with try-except is standard practice.\n- No data sinks or external data flows are present.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying the code as standard setup code.\n- No flaws or logical errors are evident in their reasoning.\n- They correctly note the absence of suspicious activity, malicious patterns, or obfuscation.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the reports.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0, with one at 0.1), justified by the lack of external data handling or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1, which is appropriate.\n- The code is benign; assigning higher risk scores would be unjustified.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard, benign module setup with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a typical package initialization script, with no signs of supply chain attack vectors, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always remain vigilant for future updates or changes, but based on this static review, the code is safe.",
