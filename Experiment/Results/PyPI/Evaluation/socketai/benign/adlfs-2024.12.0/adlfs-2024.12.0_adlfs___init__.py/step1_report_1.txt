  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for Azure-related file system classes and attempts to import version information, providing fallback values if import fails.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules and version info",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; version info is imported internally",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except for version import is normal; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected; no obfuscated or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module exports and version info with standard Python practices. It imports classes from local modules and handles import errors gracefully. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious network activity, or malicious code patterns. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a Python package, with no indication of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves to define exports and manage version info safely.",
