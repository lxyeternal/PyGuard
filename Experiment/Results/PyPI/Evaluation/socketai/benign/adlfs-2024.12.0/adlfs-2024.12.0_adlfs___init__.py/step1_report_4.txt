{
  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for Azure storage-related classes and handles version information import.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules (.gen1, .spec, ._version) and __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except for optional import of version info; no suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes from local modules and sets the __all__ attribute for public API exposure. It attempts to import version information, defaulting to 'UNKNOWN' if the import fails. The structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of external inputs. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard module setup with version handling, containing no malicious or security-threatening code. It appears safe and conventional.",
