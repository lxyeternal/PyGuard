{
  "purpose": "This code defines imports and exports for a Python package related to Azure storage services, specifically Azure Blob and Data Lake filesystems.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own version information from a private '_version' module if available.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any evident sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing version information conditionally, with no data flows leading to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code follows standard import and exception handling patterns without obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes related to Azure storage and manages version information. It uses a try-except block to handle missing version modules gracefully. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are involved. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a straightforward module setup script with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package module setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It serves to define exports and manage version info safely, without any security risks.",
