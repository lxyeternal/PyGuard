{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package that exports specific classes related to Azure storage services and attempts to import version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information from an internal module (_version). It also imports classes from other internal modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data handling or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing internal modules and exposing certain classes; no data flows from external untrusted sources to critical points.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The version import is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an __all__ list for public API exposure, imports classes related to Azure storage from internal modules, and attempts to import version info, defaulting to 'UNKNOWN' if import fails. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer for a Python package, exposing certain classes and handling version info. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
