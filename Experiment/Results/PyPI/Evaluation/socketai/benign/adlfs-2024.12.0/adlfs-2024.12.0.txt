The low security risk score (around 0.2) is appropriate, primarily reflecting the handling of credentials and deprecation notice. The malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero."

The use of SDK functions and credential handling aligns with standard practices. The main security considerations involve proper management of credentials and signed URLs, which are handled appropriately. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.2), consistent with benign SDK usage."

The scores are appropriate: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.4. Proper secret management practices should replace hardcoded secrets for improved security."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite that contains security vulnerabilities due to hardcoded credentials and unsafe pickle usage. There is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The primary concern is the potential exploitation of pickle deserialization and credential exposure. The overall security risk is moderate, but the code itself is not malicious."

The primary concern is the use of hardcoded credentials, which should be replaced with secure management practices for production. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.4), mainly due to embedded secrets."
