  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Azure Blob Storage filesystem abstraction with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The use of SDK functions and credential handling aligns with standard practices. The main security considerations involve proper management of credentials and signed URLs, which are handled appropriately. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.2), consistent with benign SDK usage."
