  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious implementation of an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 filesystem interface. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is appropriate, primarily reflecting the handling of credentials and deprecation notice. The malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero."
