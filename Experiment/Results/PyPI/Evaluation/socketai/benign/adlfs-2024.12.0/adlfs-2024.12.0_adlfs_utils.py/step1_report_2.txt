  "purpose": "Utility functions for filtering and retrieving metadata of Azure Blob Storage objects, and closing clients/credentials.",
  "sources": "blob.get('version_id') and blob.get('name') in match_blob_version and filter_blobs; container_client.get_blob_client in get_blob_metadata; close methods in close_service_client, close_container_client, close_credential.",
  "sinks": "Returning filtered blob list; retrieving blob properties and metadata; closing service, container, and credential clients.",
  "flows": "Blob data and client objects flow from sources (blob.get, container_client.get_blob_client) to sinks (return statements, close methods), with conditional logic in match_blob_version and filter_blobs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; no suspicious dynamic code execution; functions perform standard Azure SDK operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Azure Blob Storage operations: filtering blobs based on path and version ID, retrieving blob metadata, and closing clients/credentials asynchronously. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The functions are utility in nature, with proper handling of optional parameters and resource cleanup. No suspicious data handling or external network interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for managing Azure Blob Storage objects. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is safe for use, assuming the rest of the application handles data securely.",
