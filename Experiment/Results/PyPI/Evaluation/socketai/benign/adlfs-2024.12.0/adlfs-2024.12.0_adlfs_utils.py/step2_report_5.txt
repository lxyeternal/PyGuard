  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Justification:** Given the code's straightforward nature—standard Azure SDK usage, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious logic—this assessment appears accurate.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The scoring is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the code's standard utility functions, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Justification:** The slight increase in securityRisk (0.2) accounts for potential resource mismanagement if misused, but overall, the code itself is benign.\n- **Verdict:** The scores are consistent and justified. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—standard Azure SDK operations, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Justification:** The low securityRisk score aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the functions are standard resource management utilities with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is deemed legitimate utility functions, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n- **Justification:** The high confidence and low risk/malware scores are appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable given the resource management functions but do not indicate significant security risks.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal security risk due to resource management, but overall benign)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, well-structured set of utility functions for Azure Blob Storage management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
