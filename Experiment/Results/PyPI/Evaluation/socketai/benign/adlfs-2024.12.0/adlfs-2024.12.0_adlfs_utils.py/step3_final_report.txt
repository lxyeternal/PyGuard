  "purpose": "Utility functions for filtering blobs, retrieving metadata, and closing clients in Azure Blob Storage.",
  "sources": "Blob dictionary 'version_id', 'name'; container_client.get_blob_client; properties from get_blob_properties; file_obj.credential; service_client.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no network activity or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input blob data -> filtering conditions; container_client.get_blob_client -> get_blob_properties -> metadata; close methods -> resource cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets; straightforward resource management.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Azure SDK patterns for blob filtering, metadata retrieval, and resource cleanup. No malicious logic, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The functions perform typical data filtering and resource management tasks without any network activity or data exfiltration. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. The code is clear, well-structured, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of utility functions for Azure Blob Storage management, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0. The overall assessment aligns with the provided reports. The security risk score can be set at approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal operational concerns without vulnerabilities.",
