{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for filtering and retrieving metadata from Azure Blob Storage containers and blobs.",
  "sources": "Reads from blob dictionaries (e.g., 'version_id', 'name', 'metadata'), and from container_client to get blob properties.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; functions mainly perform data retrieval and cleanup operations.",
  "flows": "Blob data and properties are retrieved from external Azure SDK calls; no flow of untrusted input into dangerous sinks is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or unusual control flow; code is straightforward and mostly standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs filtering of blobs based on path and version ID, retrieves blob metadata asynchronously, and provides cleanup functions for clients. All operations rely on external SDK calls with no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic. The functions appear to implement typical Azure SDK usage patterns without obfuscation or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for interacting with Azure Blob Storage, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard SDK patterns and handles data securely without suspicious anomalies.",
