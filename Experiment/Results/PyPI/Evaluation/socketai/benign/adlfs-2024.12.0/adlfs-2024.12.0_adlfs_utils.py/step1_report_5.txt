{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for filtering and retrieving metadata from Azure Blob Storage containers and blobs, as well as closing related clients and credentials.",
  "sources": "Reads from blob objects (e.g., blob.get('version_id'), blob['name'], blob properties), container client, and file object attributes such as container_client and credential.",
  "sinks": "Returns filtered blob list, blob properties metadata, and closes clients/credentials which could affect resource management or security if misused.",
  "flows": "Input data from blob objects and container clients flow into filtering, metadata retrieval, and closure functions; no evident data flow leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code; code appears straightforward. No insecure data handling or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform standard operations: filtering blobs by path and version, retrieving metadata asynchronously, and closing clients asynchronously. No signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code handles optional parameters appropriately and uses common Azure SDK patterns. No hardcoded credentials or insecure practices are detected. The functions serve typical storage management roles without suspicious logic or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for managing Azure Blob Storage resources. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided code. There are no signs of supply chain attacks or malicious intent.",
