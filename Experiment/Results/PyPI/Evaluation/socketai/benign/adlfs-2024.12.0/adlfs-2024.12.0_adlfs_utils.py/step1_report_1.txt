{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for filtering and retrieving metadata from Azure Blob Storage, and for closing various Azure service clients.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters such as blob dictionaries, container client objects, and file object attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of async context managers to access blob properties and closing methods on service client objects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into functions that retrieve blob metadata, filter blobs based on path and version, and close service/credential objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or data leakage mechanisms are present. Use of standard Azure SDK patterns.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform typical Azure Blob Storage operations such as filtering blobs by path and version, fetching blob properties, and closing service clients asynchronously. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed. The code appears to be standard utility functions for managing Azure resources. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns. The code's structure and logic follow common best practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of utility functions for interacting with Azure Blob Storage, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
