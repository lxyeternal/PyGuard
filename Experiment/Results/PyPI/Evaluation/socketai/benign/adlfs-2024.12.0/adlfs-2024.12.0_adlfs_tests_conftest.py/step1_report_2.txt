{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a testing environment for Azure Blob Storage using the Azurite emulator, uploads test data, and manages Docker containers for the emulator.",
  "sources": "Reads hardcoded credentials (ACCOUNT_NAME, KEY), environment variables for Docker, and uses connection string to access storage.",
  "sinks": "Uses untrusted data (though static) in blob uploads; potential for data exfiltration if data or connection string is misused.",
  "flows": "Connection string and credentials flow from hardcoded variables to BlobServiceClient; data flows into blobs; container created/deleted during tests.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials in the code pose a security risk; sensitive information is stored plainly in the source code. The use of data in blob uploads is static, not inherently malicious but risky if exposed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a Dockerized Azure Storage emulator and uploads multiple blobs with static data. Credentials are hardcoded, which is a security concern. No dynamic or untrusted input is processed for malicious behavior. No evidence of malware such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or covert operations. The code performs standard setup, data upload, and cleanup operations with no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for testing and setup with no malicious intent. The main concern is the hardcoded credentials, which could be exploited if exposed. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The security risk score is moderate due to credential exposure, but overall, it appears safe for intended testing purposes.",
