  "conclusion": "The code is safe for local testing but contains insecure hardcoded credentials. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.4. Proper secret management practices should replace hardcoded secrets for improved security."
