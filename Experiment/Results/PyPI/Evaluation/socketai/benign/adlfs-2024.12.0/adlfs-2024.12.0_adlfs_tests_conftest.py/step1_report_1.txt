{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a testing environment for Azure Blob Storage using a local Azurite container and uploads sample blobs with metadata for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for Docker configuration, hardcoded connection strings, and blob data.",
  "sinks": "Uploads blobs to the local Azurite service, creates and deletes containers.",
  "flows": "Uses connection string to establish BlobServiceClient, uploads data blobs with metadata, and manages Azurite container lifecycle.",
  "anomalies": "Contains hardcoded storage account credentials, including account key and connection string. Uses sensitive data directly in code. No input validation or encryption for secrets. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs local setup and testing of Azure Blob Storage using a Docker container (Azurite). It hardcodes credentials (account name and key), which pose security risks if used outside isolated testing environments. The connection string includes sensitive information directly, which is a security concern. No malicious or suspicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft is evident. The code uses standard Azure SDK functions for blob management and Docker SDK for container management, with no unusual or obfuscated code patterns. The overall functionality appears to be benign, intended solely for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for testing and development with local storage simulation. It contains hardcoded credentials that could be exploited if exposed in a production environment, but there is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior within the code itself. The security risk is primarily due to credential exposure rather than malicious code.",
