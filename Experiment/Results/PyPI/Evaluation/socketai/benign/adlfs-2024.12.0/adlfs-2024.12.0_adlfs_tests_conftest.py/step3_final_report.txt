{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a local Azure Blob Storage testing environment using Azurite, uploads multiple blobs with static data and metadata, and cleans up afterward.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded account name ('devstoreaccount1') and account key (a static string), data bytes, and metadata dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Blob upload functions (upload_blob) where data and metadata are stored; container creation and deletion functions.",
  "flows": "Source: hardcoded credentials and static data -> BlobServiceClient connection -> container creation -> blob uploads -> cleanup (delete container).",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials; no input validation or encryption; straightforward, non-obfuscated code with no malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code uses static credentials embedded directly in the source, which poses a security risk if exposed. It employs standard SDK functions for container and blob management, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main concern is credential exposure, but the code's purpose is for local testing, not production. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, indicating no malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk score is moderate (~0.3-0.4), justified by the hardcoded secrets. Overall, the code is benign but insecure if shared externally. No evidence of malicious intent or activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe for local testing but contains insecure hardcoded credentials. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.4. Proper secret management practices should replace hardcoded secrets for improved security.",
