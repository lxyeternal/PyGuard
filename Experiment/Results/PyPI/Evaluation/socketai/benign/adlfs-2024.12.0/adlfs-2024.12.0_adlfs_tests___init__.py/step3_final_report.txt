  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Minimal or incomplete code snippets; no explicit input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential data outputs, network requests, or file operations, but none suspicious detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows are typical for benign scripts; no malicious source-to-sink paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited context. Malware scores are zero, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators. Security risk scores are low, reflecting minimal threat. Slightly higher confidence in reports with missing or minimal code is justified, but overall, the assessments are consistent.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation detected. The scores are justified and consistent across reports, indicating a very low security threat level.",
