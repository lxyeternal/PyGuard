  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper for AlphaFold3, performing model loading, inference, and output saving. It uses common libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious network behavior. The primary potential security concern is the use of user-controlled file paths for output, which could lead to file overwriting, but this is a typical risk in CLI tools and not indicative of malicious intent. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 and an obfuscation score of 0, with a low security risk score (0.1 to 0.2) reflecting this minor concern. Given the absence of malicious indicators and the standard nature of the code, the overall assessment remains that the code is safe and legitimate, with a very low security risk primarily related to user input handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward CLI tool for AlphaFold3 inference with no signs of malicious or sabotage activity. The minimal security concern relates to user-controlled output paths, which is a common and manageable risk. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, consistent with the analysis.",
