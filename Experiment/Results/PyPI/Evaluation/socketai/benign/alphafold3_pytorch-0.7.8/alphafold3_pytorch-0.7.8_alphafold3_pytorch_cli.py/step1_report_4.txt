  "purpose": "Command-line interface for running AlphaFold3 protein structure predictions and saving results as mmCIF files.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from command-line options: checkpoint path, protein/rna/dna sequences, number of sampling steps, use_cuda flag, output path.",
  "sinks": "File system write operation for saving mmCIF structure; potential use of user-supplied checkpoint path and output path.",
  "flows": "Checkpoint path input -> checkpoint existence check -> model initialization and loading -> optional CUDA device transfer -> model inference -> saving output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious domain connections, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of standard libraries and model inference flow appears normal. No network activity or secret handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard machine learning inference steps: loading a model checkpoint, optionally utilizing CUDA, performing prediction with input sequences, and saving the output structure. It uses well-known libraries like PyTorch, Bio.PDB, and 'alphafold3_pytorch'. The command-line interface manages input validation and directory creation safely. No dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The flow follows typical ML inference procedures, and there are no indicators of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for running AlphaFold3 predictions through a CLI. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, contains no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Its primary function is legitimate and secure given the context.",
