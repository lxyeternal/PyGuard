  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface for running AlphaFold3 protein structure predictions and saving the results as mmCIF files.",
  "sources": "Reads checkpoint path, sequence inputs (proteins, RNA, DNA), and output path from command-line options; checks for checkpoint existence; uses torch.cuda availability; reads and writes files (checkpoint, output structure).",
  "sinks": "File system operations for reading checkpoint files and saving output; command-line input parameters; potential for untrusted inputs influencing file paths.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> checkpoint path validation -> structure prediction -> saving output file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No network operations or data exfiltration present. Usage of well-known libraries with standard functions.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an AlphaFold3 model with a user-provided checkpoint and sequences, performs structure prediction, and saves the output. All file operations are standard and controlled by user input, with checks in place to verify checkpoint existence. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident; it does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or harmful system modifications. Use of third-party libraries appears standard and appropriate for the task.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward application for protein structure prediction with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It primarily handles file input/output and computational prediction tasks securely, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
