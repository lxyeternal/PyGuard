  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward CLI tool for AlphaFold3 inference with no signs of malicious or sabotage activity. The minimal security concern relates to user-controlled output paths, which is a common and manageable risk. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, consistent with the analysis."
