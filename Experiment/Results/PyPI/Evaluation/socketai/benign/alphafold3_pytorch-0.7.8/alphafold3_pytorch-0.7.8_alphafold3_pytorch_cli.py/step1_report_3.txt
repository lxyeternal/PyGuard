  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface for running AlphaFold3 protein structure prediction using specified input sequences and saving the results as a mmCIF file.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters from command-line options, including checkpoint path, sequences, and output path. Reads sequence data from user-provided strings. Reads CUDA availability status from torch.cuda.is_available(). Reads input checkpoint file from filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Writes the output structure file to disk at the specified output path. No direct network communication or system modifications are observed.",
  "flows": "User provides sequence data and checkpoint path -> Script initializes AlphaFold3 model -> Loads checkpoint from filesystem -> Executes model inference -> Saves resulting structure to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No suspicious dynamic code execution. Usage of standard libraries (click, torch, pathlib, Bio.PDB). No obfuscated code, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as a CLI wrapper for AlphaFold3 inference, reading sequence inputs and checkpoint files from disk, performing structure prediction, and saving the output locally. It uses standard libraries for filesystem operations, deep learning inference, and sequence input. No suspicious data flows or hidden behaviors are evident. The use of torch.cuda.is_available() and model evaluation is standard. The code ensures checkpoint existence before loading, which is a good practice. Overall, the logic is straightforward and appears to be intended solely for scientific computation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a command-line interface for running AlphaFold3 predictions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It safely loads models, performs inference, and saves results locally. No security risks or suspicious activities are detected.",
