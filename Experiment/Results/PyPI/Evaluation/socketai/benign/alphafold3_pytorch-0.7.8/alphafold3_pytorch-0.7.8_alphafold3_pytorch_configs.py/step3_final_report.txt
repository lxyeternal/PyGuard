  "purpose": "Configuration loading, validation, and object instantiation for Alphafold3 models, datasets, trainers, and conductors based on YAML files.",
  "sources": "YAML configuration files, file paths, dataset directories, environment variables (if any).",
  "sinks": "Object creation (Alphafold3, Dataset, Trainer, Conductor), file existence assertions, validation checks.",
  "flows": "YAML files -> parsed dictionaries -> validated data -> class instances (models, datasets, trainers, conductors).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; use of assertions for validation (which can be disabled), but standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code safely loads YAML configurations using 'yaml.safe_load', performs validation with pydantic, and creates instances accordingly. No network operations, code injection, or dynamic execution based on untrusted data are present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are detected. The structure is straightforward, with explicit validation and object creation, indicating standard configuration management for ML pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe configuration loader and object instantiator for an ML pipeline. It exhibits no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and very low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified based on the analysis.",
