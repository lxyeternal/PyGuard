  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described issues with the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code provides wrappers for ESM and ProstT5 models, with no suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious activity. The decorator `remove_plms` temporarily deletes and restores the `plms` attribute, which is a standard pattern.\n\n- **Code verification:**  \n  - The `remove_plms` decorator indeed deletes `self.plms` if it exists, then restores it after the function call.  \n  - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.  \n  - No network activity or external data leaks.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (low, as a precaution)\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. The low risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the safe use of external models, no malicious behavior, and standard practices.\n\n- **Code verification:**  \n  - The code loads models via `esm.pretrained.load_model_and_alphabet_hub` and `T5EncoderModel.from_pretrained`.  \n  - No suspicious network activity beyond standard model loading.  \n  - No hardcoded secrets or malicious code.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (still low, given standard model loading)\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent with the code. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, similar observations, emphasizing no malicious activity, no data leaks, and proper use of external libraries.\n\n- **Code verification:**  \n  - The wrappers are straightforward, using common ML practices.  \n  - No suspicious behaviors or backdoors.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion matches the code. The risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar, noting the decorator's use of `delattr` for temporary attribute removal, which is benign here.\n\n- **Code verification:**  \n  - The `remove_plms` decorator uses `delattr` and `setattr`, which is a standard pattern for temporarily removing attributes.  \n  - No malicious code or network activity.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard wrapper for pretrained models, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Code verification:**  \n  - Model loading from trusted sources, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.  \n  - No data exfiltration or malicious network activity.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (reasonable)\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation; scores are 0.\n\n- **Risk scores:** They are low, mostly 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal security concern. Given the code's straightforward nature, these are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final personal estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to the use of `delattr` in the decorator, which is benign but slightly unusual.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and well-justified. The scores are appropriate given the code's nature. No changes needed.**",
