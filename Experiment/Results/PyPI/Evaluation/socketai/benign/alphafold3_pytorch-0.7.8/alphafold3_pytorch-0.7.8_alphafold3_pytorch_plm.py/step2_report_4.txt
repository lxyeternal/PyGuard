  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing the described logic and implementation with the original code, and assess the correctness of the security assessment, scores, and any potential discrepancies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides wrappers for ESM and ProstT5 models, processes amino acid IDs into embeddings, no external data leaks or malicious behavior. The decorator `remove_plms` temporarily deletes and restores an attribute `plms`, which is standard.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Are issues present?** No. The code appears straightforward and safe.\n  - **Errors or flaws?** None identified.\n  - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n  - **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code loads models, processes sequences, and returns embeddings, with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Are issues present?** No.\n  - **Errors or flaws?** None.\n  - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n  - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code wraps external models, processes data, and produces embeddings, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Are issues present?** No.\n  - **Errors or flaws?** None.\n  - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 appropriate.\n  - **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, with emphasis on standard practices and no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Are issues present?** No.\n  - **Errors or flaws?** None.\n  - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 reasonable.\n  - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar assessment; no malicious behavior, standard library usage, safe model loading.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Are issues present?** No.\n  - **Errors or flaws?** None.\n  - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n  - **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code snippets are standard wrappers for loading and processing models, with no suspicious or malicious logic.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern, but given the benign nature, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** The current scores are appropriate; they could be lowered to 0 if desired, but 0.1-0.2 is acceptable given the context.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the use of dynamic attribute removal, which is benign but slightly unusual)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate in their assessments. No modifications are necessary. The code is safe, and the scores are justified.",
