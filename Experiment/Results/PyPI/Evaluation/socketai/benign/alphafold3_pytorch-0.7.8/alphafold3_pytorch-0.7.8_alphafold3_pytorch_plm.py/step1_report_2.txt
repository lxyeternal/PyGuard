{
  "purpose": "The code provides wrappers around pre-trained language models (ESM and ProstT5) to generate protein sequence embeddings, mainly for use in bioinformatics workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads sequence data from input tensors (aa_ids), external model files (loaded via esm and transformers libraries), and the model's internal buffers and attributes.",
  "sinks": "The code performs tensor operations, loads external models, and creates embeddings without explicitly writing or transmitting untrusted data externally.",
  "flows": "Input aa_ids tensor → processed into sequence data → encoded using external models → embeddings returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports models from external libraries, which is normal. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are detected. No unusual or obfuscated code present. The decorator removes and restores attributes but does not perform malicious actions. No network connections, file writes, or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it loads external models, processes sequence data into embeddings, and uses standard libraries and APIs. No evidence of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system manipulation. The dynamic import of models is standard practice in ML workflows. The code appears to be a legitimate component of a protein embedding pipeline, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of protein embedding wrappers using pre-trained models. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The design and implementation are consistent with legitimate research or production use in bioinformatics workflows.",
