{
  "purpose": "Provides wrappers for pretrained protein language models (ESM and ProstT5) to generate embeddings from amino acid sequences.",
  "sources": "Reads input tensors 'aa_ids' representing amino acid sequences; loads models via external libraries (esm, transformers).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data exfiltration observed; no network activity or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are processed into sequence data, encoded via model-specific tokenizers, passed through models, and embeddings are returned.",
  "anomalies": "The 'remove_plms' decorator temporarily deletes the 'plms' attribute using 'delattr' and restores it, which is unusual but benign in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code loads models from trusted sources, processes sequence data into embeddings, and uses standard patterns for model inference. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The 'delattr' pattern in the decorator is unconventional but not malicious. External dependencies are standard and used appropriately. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of protein sequence embedding wrappers with no malicious intent or security risks. The low malware score (0) and obfuscated score (0) are justified. The risk score (0.1) reflects minimal concern due to the decorator pattern and external dependencies, but overall, the code is safe.",
