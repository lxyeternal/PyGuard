{
  "purpose": "The code provides wrappers around pre-trained language models (ESM and ProstT5) for obtaining protein sequence embeddings, likely used in bioinformatics applications.",
  "sources": "Input amino acid IDs (`aa_ids`) from the `forward` methods of `ESMWrapper` and `ProstT5Wrapper` classes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any apparent sinks that send untrusted data externally or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Amino acid IDs are processed in `forward` methods, converted into sequences, then encoded by model tokenizers, and passed into pre-trained models to generate embeddings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. Usage of third-party libraries (e.g., esm, transformers) is typical and appropriate. Buffer registration with dummy tensor appears standard. No obfuscation or misleading code identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines wrappers around external pre-trained models for protein embedding extraction, utilizing common practices such as decorator patterns, buffer registration, and model inference with no data leaks or malicious network activity. External dependencies are used properly, and no suspicious data handling or system manipulation observed. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code appears well-structured and focused on embedding computation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily wrapping external models for embedding extraction without malicious intent or malicious behavior. No security risks or malware indicators detected.",
