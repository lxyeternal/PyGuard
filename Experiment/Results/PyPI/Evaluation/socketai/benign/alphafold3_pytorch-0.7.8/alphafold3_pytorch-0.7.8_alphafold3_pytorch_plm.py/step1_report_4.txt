{
  "purpose": "The code provides wrappers for pre-trained language models (PLMs) for protein sequences, specifically ESM and ProstT5, to generate embeddings for amino acid sequences.",
  "sources": "Reads sequence input data via tensor arguments (aa_ids) and uses external libraries for model loading and tokenization.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted data to effect system changes or leaks.",
  "flows": "Input tensors (aa_ids) are processed into sequence data, converted to model-specific inputs, then embeddings are generated and returned; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network calls or data exfiltration observed. Usage of 'delattr' for temporary attribute removal in decorator is unusual but benign in context.",
  "analysis": "The code defines model wrappers for ESM and ProstT5, handling sequence encoding and embedding extraction. The remove_plms decorator temporarily deletes an attribute 'plms' from objects, then restores it—this pattern is uncommon but not malicious. External dependencies (esm, transformers) are standard for model loading. There are no signs of malicious activities such as network communication, data theft, or system damage. The code appears to be standard model wrapper code, with no suspicious logic or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of model wrappers for protein sequence embeddings, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. No security risks are apparent beyond standard model handling procedures.",
