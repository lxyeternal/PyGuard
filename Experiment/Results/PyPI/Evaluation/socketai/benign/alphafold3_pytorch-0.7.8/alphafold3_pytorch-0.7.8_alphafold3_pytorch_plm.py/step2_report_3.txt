  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides wrappers for ESM and ProstT5 models, with no suspicious behavior, no external data leaks, and standard deep learning workflows.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The decorator pattern for temporary attribute removal is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No issues found.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate assessment.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with no suspicious activity, external data leaks, or malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** External model loading via esm and transformers is standard. No network activity or data exfiltration.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct reasoning.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, wrappers for pre-trained models with no malicious intent.\n- **Findings:** Proper use of third-party libraries, no suspicious code or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** **Appropriate.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** The decorator pattern (removing `plms`) is unusual but benign. No network activity or data exfiltration.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent with code.\n\n**Verdict:** **Correct.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no network activity, no backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** **Appropriate.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, as the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), which is reasonable given the code's purpose and structure.\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low risk, mainly due to use of external models and decorators, but no security concerns)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n**The reports are consistent with the code's analysis.** They correctly identify that the code is a standard, benign implementation of protein embedding wrappers with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n**No adjustments needed.**",
