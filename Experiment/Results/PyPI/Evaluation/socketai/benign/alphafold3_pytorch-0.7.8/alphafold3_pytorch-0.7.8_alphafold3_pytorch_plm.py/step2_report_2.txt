  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing the findings with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code wraps ESM and ProstT5 models for protein embeddings. No suspicious data flows, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets. The `remove_plms` decorator temporarily deletes and restores the `plms` attribute, which is a common pattern.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code's purpose and notes the lack of malicious activity. The `remove_plms` decorator, while somewhat unusual, is benign here. The confidence score of 0.9 aligns with the evidence.\n\n- **Potential Issue:** No issues found. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code loads models, processes sequences, and returns embeddings without external data leaks or malicious behavior. No backdoors or network activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The dynamic import of models is standard. No signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, security risk 0.2, which seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code wraps external models, processes input tensors, and produces embeddings. No suspicious activity, secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears legitimate, with no malicious indicators. The buffer registration with a dummy tensor is standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1, matching the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports. The only somewhat unusual pattern is the `delattr` in the `remove_plms` decorator, but it is explained as benign.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior detected. The code is a typical wrapper for model inference.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.1, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard wrapper code, with no network activity, no secrets, no obfuscation. The code loads models from trusted sources and processes data accordingly.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity. The code is straightforward.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Justification:**\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely for model inference, loading models, processing sequences, and returning embeddings.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code is present; all code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Given the absence of external data leaks, network activity, or malicious logic, the risk scores are appropriately low (around 0.1–0.2).\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Estimated scores based on the code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear, standard, and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Minimal, primarily due to the `delattr` pattern, which is benign in context.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code. The code appears safe, with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured implementation of protein sequence embedding wrappers. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The low risk and malware scores are appropriate.",
