  "purpose": "Implementation of multi-head attention with local windowing, residual value mixing, softclamping, and biasing mechanisms for neural network models like AlphaFold.",
  "sources": "Tensor inputs (seq, context, mask, attn_bias, windowed_mask), model parameters, internal tensor operations.",
  "sinks": "Tensor outputs used in downstream model layers; no external system calls or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input tensors flow through linear projections, head splitting, attention calculations, and merging; attention bias and masks influence similarity scores; residuals and gating modify outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external communication detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of multi-head attention with local windowing, residual value mixing, softclamping, and biasing. It uses common tensor operations, no obfuscation, and no external data sources. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to handling untrusted inputs, which is typical in such models. The malware score is zero, obfuscation score is zero, and the risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting standard caution but no actual threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security risk score is justified by the potential for misuse of tensor inputs but does not indicate any vulnerability or malicious activity.",
