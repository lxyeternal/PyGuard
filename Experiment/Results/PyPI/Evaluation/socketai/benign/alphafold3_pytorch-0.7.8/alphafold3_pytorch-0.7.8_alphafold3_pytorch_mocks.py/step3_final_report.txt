  "purpose": "Synthetic dataset generator for molecular and atom data used in testing or model training.",
  "sources": "Random data generation via torch.randn, torch.randint, and Python's random module.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network activity, or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Internal data creation and consistency checks; no external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; 'nosec' comment is a standard security suppression marker.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a mock dataset class that generates synthetic molecular data with internal consistency checks. It relies solely on in-memory random data generation, with no external dependencies, network activity, or secret handling. The presence of a 'nosec' comment indicates awareness of static analysis tools but does not imply malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns, serving purely for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard mock dataset generator with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The existing scores of malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
