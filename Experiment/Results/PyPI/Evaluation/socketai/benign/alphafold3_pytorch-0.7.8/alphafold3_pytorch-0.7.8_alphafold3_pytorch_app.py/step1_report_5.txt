{
  "purpose": "The code provides a web interface for protein, DNA, RNA, ligand, and ion structure prediction using AlphaFold3, allowing users to input sequences, manage cache, and visualize output structures.",
  "sources": "User inputs sequences or selections via Gradio UI, including molecule type, copies, and specific sequences or choices. It also reads environment variables indirectly through potential external dependencies.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output PDB files to the filesystem using secrets-generated filenames. It deletes cache directories and handles user sessions. There are no evident data leaks or unsafe data handling mechanisms.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> `add_entity` processes and stores in `entities` -> `fold` constructs AlphaFold3 inputs and runs model inference -> structure saved to filesystem -> output path returned. Cache deletion flows from user session data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `secrets.token_urlsafe()` for filenames ensures unique, unpredictable file names. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are present. The code relies on external dependencies like `Bio.PDB`, `alphafold3_pytorch`, and `gradio` without suspicious modifications. The model is loaded from user-specified checkpoint without validation, but this is typical for such scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a user interface around a molecular modeling pipeline. It safely manages user inputs, avoids executing arbitrary code, and writes output files securely with non-hardcoded filenames. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, system sabotage, or hidden backdoors, are evident. The use of secrets for filenames is a good practice to prevent filename guessing attacks. Cache deletion is session-based and does not involve unsafe operations. The external dependencies are typical for this domain and do not introduce malicious code themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a typical application code for molecular structure prediction with a web UI, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code components. It manages inputs and outputs securely, and no suspicious behaviors are detected.",
