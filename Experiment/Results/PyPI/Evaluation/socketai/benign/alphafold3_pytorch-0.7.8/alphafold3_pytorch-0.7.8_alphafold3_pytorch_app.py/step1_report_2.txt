{
  "purpose": "This code provides a web interface for users to input molecular entities, generate protein or nucleic acid structures using AlphaFold3, and visualize the results. It manages model inference, user input, and cache handling.",
  "sources": "User input from the gradio interface (sequences, molecule types, session hashes). Sequence validation occurs within 'add_entity'. Environment variables are not directly used. The model is loaded from a specified checkpoint.",
  "sinks": "Generated PDB files saved to the cache directory using secrets.token_urlsafe for filenames. The files are stored locally, with no evident data exfiltration or network communication in the provided code. No sensitive data is transmitted or written outside the local environment.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> 'add_entity' validation -> entities list -> 'fold' function generates structure -> saved locally in cache path with session hash -> potential file download or display.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'secrets.token_urlsafe' for filename generation is secure but generates unpredictable filenames, which is acceptable. The code performs sequence validation, but no other suspicious logic or backdoors are detected. No hardcoded credentials or environment variables are observed. The 'delete_cache' function deletes user cache directories, which is standard. No obfuscated code, encryption, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages user input, sequence validation, and model inference. It loads a model from a specified checkpoint path and saves generated structures to a cache directory. No network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious commands are evident. The use of 'secrets' for filename generation ensures unique file names. The model inference and file handling are contained within the code's scope. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate application for molecular structure prediction with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a web-based molecular structure prediction tool utilizing AlphaFold3. It handles user inputs securely, performs validation, and saves outputs locally without evident malicious or suspicious behavior. No malicious code, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
