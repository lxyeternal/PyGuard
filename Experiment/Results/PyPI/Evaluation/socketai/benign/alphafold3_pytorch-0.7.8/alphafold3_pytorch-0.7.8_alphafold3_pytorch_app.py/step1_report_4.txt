{
  "purpose": "The code provides a web UI for protein and nucleic acid structure prediction using AlphaFold3, allowing users to upload sequences, select molecule types, and visualize predicted structures.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input from GUI components such as textboxes, dropdowns, and buttons, as well as from request objects for session hashes.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output structure files to the filesystem, particularly in cache directories; also uses secrets.token_urlsafe to generate filenames, and the model inference may process user-provided sequences.",
  "flows": "User inputs via GUI components are collected and passed to the 'fold' function, which constructs input for the model. The model generates structures, which are then saved to disk using PDBIO. Cache directory paths are constructed based on session hashes, and files are saved accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'secrets.token_urlsafe' for filename generation suggests an attempt to create unique filenames. The code dynamically creates directories based on session hashes. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The model inference runs in a separate thread but does not appear to execute untrusted code or network communication. No obfuscated code or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script implements a web interface for structural predictions using AlphaFold3, with input validation for sequences. The only notable dynamic behavior is the use of 'secrets.token_urlsafe' for filenames, which is standard for secure, unique identifiers. File handling is confined to designated cache directories, and no external network connections or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The core logic is straightforward and primarily involves user input collection, model inference, and file output. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malware are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of a web UI for protein structure prediction with no malicious intent or behavior. It securely handles user inputs, performs computations, and saves outputs within designated directories. No malicious or sabotage-related code segments are identified.",
