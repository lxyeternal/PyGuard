{
  "purpose": "The code implements a web-based interface for molecular structure prediction using AlphaFold3, allowing users to input various biomolecules, manage cache, and visualize output structures.",
  "sources": "User input fields for molecule type, sequence, and number of copies; session hash used for cache directory; filename generated via secrets.token_urlsafe() for output PDB files.",
  "sinks": "Local file system where output PDB files are saved; cache directory for temporary data; no network or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "User inputs → validation and normalization → entity list update → fold function invoked → model inference → structure output → saved to cache directory with randomized filename → visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; standard use of libraries; cache deletion function (`shutil.rmtree`) could be misused if session hashes are manipulated, but this is a typical pattern and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation, runs a model inference with AlphaFold3, and manages local files securely. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. Filename randomness via secrets is appropriate. Cache management functions are standard but should be used carefully. Overall, the code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with legitimate scientific software practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent application for molecular structure prediction with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minimal concerns relate to cache management, which is typical in such tools and does not indicate malicious intent.",
