{
  "purpose": "This code implements a web interface for protein and nucleic acid structure prediction using the AlphaFold3 model, allowing users to input sequences or select molecules, generate structures, and visualize them.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from the Gradio interface (molecule type, sequences, selections), and session-specific data for cache management.",
  "sinks": "Writes output structure files (.pdb) to cache directory; reads checkpoint files for model loading; deletes cache directories; generates session-specific output files.",
  "flows": "User inputs → add_entity function processes sequences → fold function runs model inference → save structure file to cache directory → display in UI; delete_cache removes user cache directories.",
  "anomalies": "Use of secrets.token_urlsafe() for naming output files is standard; no hardcoded credentials or secret keys are present; no suspicious network activity or obfuscated code; dependencies appear legitimate for structural bioinformatics; no malicious data leaks or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a user interface for molecular structure prediction, managing inputs, outputs, and cache directories. Model inference is performed using the Alphafold3 library, and output files are saved with random file names. No external network connections are made during inference; all file handling seems to be for output storage. The use of secrets for file naming is standard practice for avoiding filename collisions. No malicious or suspicious code patterns, such as data exfiltration, hidden network activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are present. Dependency libraries are legitimate for scientific computing and UI. Overall, the code appears intended for legitimate bioinformatics purposes with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a web UI for protein and nucleic acid structure prediction using AlphaFold3. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious sabotage. The code’s functions, dependencies, and data flows are consistent with a legitimate scientific tool.",
