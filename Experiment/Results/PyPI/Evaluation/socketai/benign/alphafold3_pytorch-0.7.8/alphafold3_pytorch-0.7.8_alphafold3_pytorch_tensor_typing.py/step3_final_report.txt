{
  "purpose": "The code initializes environment configurations, performs dependency checks, manages feature toggles, and sets up utility functions for a larger Python project, primarily focusing on environment and dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables via 'environs', checks package availability with 'importlib.metadata' and 'sh.which', and executes external commands using 'sh'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; no network connections or data exfiltration points are present; no sensitive information handling or malicious payloads detected.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence feature flags; dependency checks determine module imports; external command checks (e.g., 'sh.which') influence feature toggles; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of 'sh' for command detection is standard; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; environment variable reliance is typical for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment setup, dependency verification, and feature toggling with standard practices. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The use of environment variables, package checks, and conditional imports is conventional. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical environment and dependency management script with no malicious or security concerns. It is well-structured, transparent, and safe. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
