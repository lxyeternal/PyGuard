  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report correctly identifies that the code performs environment/configuration setup, dependency checks, and feature toggles. It notes the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.\n- **Assessment:** The code's logic is straightforward: environment variable reads, package availability checks, conditional imports, and utility functions. No evidence of malicious activity or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — reasonable given the low likelihood of risk.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Since the code only manages environment setup and dependency checks, a low risk score (0.1) is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0, as no malicious behavior is present.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe dependency and environment checks, with no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The code's use of environment variables, package checks, and conditional imports are standard. No untrusted data processing or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — slightly higher but still reasonable, considering the use of external command checks.\n- **Justification:** The only potential concern is reliance on environment variables and external command checks, but these are standard practices.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical environment setup with dependency checks, environment variable toggles, and feature configuration.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. Use of 'sh' for command existence checks is common.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; the code is standard setup.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, focusing on environment setup, dependency verification, and feature toggling.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious code or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code's purpose is configuration; no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard environment and dependency setup with feature toggles.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior or suspicious activity observed.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — acceptable, given the reliance on environment variables and external commands, but still low risk.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent, only environment checks.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified; no malicious code or payloads are present.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but all low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the low-risk nature of environment/configuration scripts.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — given the code's purpose, environment reliance, and dependency checks, the overall risk remains very low.\n\n### Final notes:\n\n- The reports are consistent with the code.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard setup script with no security concerns. The current scores are appropriate.",
