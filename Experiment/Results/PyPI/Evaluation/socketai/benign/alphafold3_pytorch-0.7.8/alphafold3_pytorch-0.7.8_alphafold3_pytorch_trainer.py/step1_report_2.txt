{
  "purpose": "The code defines a training framework for the Alphafold3 model, handling data loading, model training, validation, checkpointing, and optional EMA and distributed evaluation.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are primarily through datasets and dataloaders; environment variables are not explicitly used; model parameters are set via constructor arguments; no external untrusted input handling detected.",
  "sinks": "Model parameters and states are saved to disk; checkpoints are written via torch.save; model inference outputs are not explicitly sent over the network; no code injections or external command executions are observed.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded via dataloaders, passed into the model for training; loss is computed and backpropagated; model and optimizer states are saved to disk; validation and testing involve model inference with no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. All code functions and variables are standard for a training script. No unusual data leaks or privacy violations are evident. The code appears clean, modular, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard deep learning training loop with checkpointing, EMA, and distributed evaluation support. It handles data loading, model training, validation, testing, and logging in a conventional manner. No external network calls, hidden commands, or malicious behaviors are present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated constructs are used. The code appears to be a legitimate training framework, with safety aligned to typical deep learning practices.",
  "conclusion": "The source code appears to be a standard, legitimate training script for Alphafold3, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It securely handles model states and data, with no suspicious network activity or hidden behaviors. Overall, the code is safe for use from a supply chain security perspective.",
