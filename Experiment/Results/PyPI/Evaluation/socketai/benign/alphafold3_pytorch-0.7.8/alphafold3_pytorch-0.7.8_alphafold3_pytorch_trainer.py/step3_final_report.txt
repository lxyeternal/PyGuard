{
  "purpose": "A comprehensive training framework for AlphaFold3, including data loading, model training, validation, checkpointing, and EMA management, following standard ML practices.",
  "sources": "Filesystem operations for loading datasets, saving/loading model checkpoints, and logging; no external network or untrusted input handling detected.",
  "sinks": "Model state dictionaries saved to disk, checkpoints stored locally, logs written locally; no data leaks or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from datasets through data loaders into the model; model outputs are used for loss computation; checkpoints and logs are stored locally; no external network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Code structure is clear and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard deep learning training practices with clear structure, including data loading, model training, validation, checkpointing, EMA, and distributed evaluation. No network activity, external data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The security risk is minimal, justified by the absence of external communication, secrets, or covert operations. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured training pipeline for AlphaFold3 with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe from a supply chain perspective.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
