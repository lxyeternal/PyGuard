{
  "purpose": "The code implements a training framework for an Alphafold3 model, including data loading, training loop, checkpoint management, and evaluation procedures.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from datasets via DataLoader and collate functions; model parameters are read during load; environment variables are not explicitly read; no network or system info is read or transmitted.",
  "sinks": "Model's state dicts saved to disk; model and optimizer states loaded from disk; no explicit data leaks or external communications are observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset through DataLoader to model; model outputs loss which flows to optimizer and backpropagation; checkpoints and logs flow to filesystem; model states flow to disk and back during load/save.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. No backdoors, credential theft, or hidden network activities are evident. All functions serve typical training workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily facilitates distributed training, checkpointing, evaluation, and model management. It uses common libraries and practices without any suspicious logic. No external network communication, credential handling, or covert data exfiltration present. The use of third-party libraries is standard, and no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate training script for machine learning models with no malicious intent. It lacks any signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks. The overall security risk score is very low.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
