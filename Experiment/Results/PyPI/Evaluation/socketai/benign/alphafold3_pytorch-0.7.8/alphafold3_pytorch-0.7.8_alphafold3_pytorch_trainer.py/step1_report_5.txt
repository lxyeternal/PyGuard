{
  "purpose": "The code implements a machine learning training framework for the Alphafold3 model, including data loading, training loop, validation, checkpointing, and EMA management.",
  "sources": "Data inputs via DataLoader, model parameters, optimizer states, environment variables, and file system for checkpoints.",
  "sinks": "Saving/loading model and optimizer states to/from disk; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Inputs (datasets, model parameters) flow into the training loop; model outputs and losses flow to backpropagation; checkpoints are saved to disk; EMA updates flow during training.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard ML training practices; no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communications, or unauthorized system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard training script with comprehensive model management, including checkpointing, EMA, distributed evaluation, and flexible optimizer setup. No suspicious code, hidden network communications, or malicious modifications are present. Use of third-party libraries appears consistent with their typical roles in ML workflows. No obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent detected. All file operations are for saving/loading model states, typical in training pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate training framework for Alphafold3 with no malicious or sabotage behavior. It performs model training, validation, checkpointing, and EMA updates using standard practices, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
