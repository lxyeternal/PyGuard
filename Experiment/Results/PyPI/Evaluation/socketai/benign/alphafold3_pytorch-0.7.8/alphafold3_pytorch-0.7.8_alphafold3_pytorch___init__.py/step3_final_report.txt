{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or API aggregator for the 'alphafold3_pytorch' library, importing various components and exposing them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from the 'alphafold3_pytorch' package, reading no external or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; only module exports.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; purely static import and export of components.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ list, typical for a package's __init__.py or module aggregator. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing is present. All imported components are from a known open-source scientific library. The static nature and lack of runtime operations indicate no malicious intent or security risks. The scores from the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It functions as a standard module setup for the 'alphafold3_pytorch' library, and all evidence supports a very low security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
