{
  "purpose": "The code primarily imports and exports functions, classes, and modules related to the alphafold3_pytorch library for protein structure prediction and related utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from various modules within the alphafold3_pytorch package, including attention mechanisms, model components, input processing, training, configuration, and utility functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data or external network communication observed. No code executes external commands, writes files, or handles sensitive data in a suspicious manner.",
  "flows": "The code defines import statements and an __all__ list, facilitating modular use of the library components; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is visible in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward module import/export statements with no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "This code is a typical module initialization script that organizes and exports the functions and classes from the alphafold3_pytorch library. It does not perform any runtime operations, data processing, or external communication. The imports include standard library components and the library's internal modules, indicating structured code organization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection. The structure and content align with standard Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module initializer for the alphafold3_pytorch library, with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It merely consolidates public API components for external use.",
