  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to assess the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the accuracy of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as a comprehensive test suite for crispy_forms, with sources being form data, helper configurations, and context variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identifies HTML output as the main sink, with data flowing from form instances and helpers into templates.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code. The code performs standard testing of form rendering, error handling, media inclusion, etc.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that the code is safe and free from malicious behavior is justified. The confidence score of 0.95 is appropriate given the thorough review.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with a focus on form rendering and external templates/media.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious payloads, no external system calls, and no suspicious code. External media inclusion is standard for styling and scripting, not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states that the code is a safe test suite with no malicious behavior. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on unit tests for crispy_forms, with standard input data and CSRF token generation.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious code, no dynamic code execution, no external network calls. The CSRF token handling is standard, and the code is confined within testing boundaries.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Validates that the code is safe, with a high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on rendering, error display, media, and context passing.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, code injection, or supply chain sabotage. External templates are used but are not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states safety and no malicious behavior, with high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on form rendering and validation, with controlled input data.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious code, no external network or file system operations, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies the code as safe, with high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or security risks.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard test suite for Django's crispy_forms library.\n- It performs rendering, validation, and layout testing without any malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or external system interactions.\n- The CSRF tokens are generated and injected in a controlled manner, typical for testing.\n- External media and templates are referenced but not malicious.\n- No evidence of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is safe, standard, and free from malicious or obfuscated content. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
