{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for Django crispy_forms, validating rendering, layout, error handling, media inclusion, CSRF handling, and context passing in various scenarios.",
  "sources": "Form instances, FormHelper attributes, context variables, and template rendering functions.",
  "sinks": "Generated HTML output, including form tags, input fields, error messages, media links, and CSRF tokens.",
  "flows": "Data flows from form data and helper configurations into HTML templates via rendering functions, with CSRF tokens injected into forms when applicable.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or external network calls. Use of standard Django functions like _get_new_csrf_string() is typical for tests.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard form rendering tests, including validation, error display, media inclusion, and context passing. No external or untrusted data sources are involved. CSRF tokens are generated with Django's internal functions, and media files are static assets. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign and controlled nature of the test suite.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured test suite for Django crispy_forms, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores accurately reflect its benign nature.",
