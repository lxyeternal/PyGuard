  "purpose": "Configuration settings for a Django project, including installed apps, middleware, database, templates, and other settings.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), os.path.abspath(__file__), string literals such as 'secretkey' and app names.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flow leading to security-sensitive sinks or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "N/A — configuration values are static and do not show data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded SECRET_KEY ('secretkey'), which is insecure for production; potential for misuse if used outside development context. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django settings module with typical configuration parameters. It imports 'os' for path handling, sets up installed apps, middleware, database (using in-memory SQLite), template settings, and security options. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded as 'secretkey', which is a security risk if used in production environments, but not malicious per se. No user input or untrusted data sources are present, and no dynamic code execution or network interactions are evident. The code does not include obfuscated or malicious logic. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward and intended for development or testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django configuration file with no malicious behavior. The main security concern is the hardcoded SECRET_KEY, which should not be used in production. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flows.",
