{
  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a Django web application, including app registration, database settings, middleware, templates, and other Django-specific settings.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration values such as SECRET_KEY, file paths for templates, environment variables for OS operations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks like network operations, system calls, or database queries that process untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "The code mainly sets static configuration; there are no data flows from external sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded as 'secretkey', which is insecure. No other unusual or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a static configuration file for Django. It does not include user input handling, dynamic code execution, or network communication. The use of a hardcoded SECRET_KEY is a security concern, but does not constitute malware or malicious code. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are present. Overall, the code appears standard for Django setup with some insecure practices but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Django settings module with insecure hardcoded secret key but no malicious behavior or malware. It poses a security warning due to the hardcoded secret but does not exhibit malicious intent or actions.",
