  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a Django web application including installed apps, database settings, middleware, templates, and other settings.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), os.path.abspath(__file__), SECRET_KEY",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data affects system or leaks occur",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static configuration data is used",
  "anomalies": "The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded as 'secretkey', which is insecure for production but not malicious. No other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django settings module with static configuration data. It reads file paths based on the script location and sets various configuration options. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded as 'secretkey', which is insecure but not malicious, likely for development purposes. No user input handling, no network operations, and no suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be standard configuration without obfuscated or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django configuration module with no malicious behavior detected. The hardcoded SECRET_KEY indicates a development setting rather than production, but it does not pose a security risk in this context.",
