  "purpose": "Configure Django settings for a web application, including database, middleware, templates, and installed apps.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname, os.path.abspath, os.path.join, string literals for SECRET_KEY and INSTALLED_APPS",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data being written or used in insecure ways",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is apparent",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded SECRET_KEY, which is a security risk; no other suspicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django settings configuration. It uses os.path functions to determine directory paths and sets various Django settings such as INSTALLED_APPS, DATABASES, MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES, TEMPLATES, and SECRET_KEY. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded as 'secretkey', which is insecure but not malicious. There is no indication of malicious code, such as network communications, file operations, or code execution. The settings are straightforward and typical for a Django project, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Django configuration code with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The only security concern is the hardcoded SECRET_KEY, which should be secured and not exposed in production. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks beyond this best practice issue.",
