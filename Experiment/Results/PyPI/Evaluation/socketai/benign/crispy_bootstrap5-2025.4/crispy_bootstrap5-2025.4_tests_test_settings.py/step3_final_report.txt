  "purpose": "Standard Django settings configuration for a development environment, with no dynamic code or external data sources.",
  "sources": "os.path functions for directory paths, hardcoded strings such as SECRET_KEY.",
  "sinks": "None; static configuration without untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of configuration variables; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded SECRET_KEY, which is insecure for production but typical in development/testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django settings module with static paths and configurations. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The only security concern is the hardcoded SECRET_KEY, which is a common practice in development environments but should be replaced in production. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score reflects the insecure SECRET_KEY but remains low due to the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation. The only security issue is the hardcoded SECRET_KEY, which is typical for development but should be secured in production. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
