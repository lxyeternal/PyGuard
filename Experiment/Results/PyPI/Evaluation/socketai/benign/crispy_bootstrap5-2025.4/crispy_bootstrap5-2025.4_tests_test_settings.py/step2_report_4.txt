  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a standard Django settings module.\n- All reports correctly identify the use of static, hardcoded configuration values, especially the SECRET_KEY.\n- No untrusted input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code is present.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.2-0.3), reflecting the insecure practice of hardcoding secrets but not indicating active exploitation or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:**  \n  - The use of a hardcoded SECRET_KEY is insecure, especially if used outside of testing/development environments.  \n  - No dynamic or untrusted input processing is present.  \n  - No code anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are detected.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate, no malicious activity)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n  - SecurityRisk: Low, consistent with insecure secret storage but no active threats.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review:\n- The **malware score** of 0 is justified and consistent; no malware or malicious code is present.\n- The **obfuscated score** of 0 is justified; code is straightforward.\n- The **risk scores** are slightly higher (~0.2-0.3) mainly due to insecure secret management, which is a common issue in development settings but not a malware indicator.\n\n### Potential improvements:\n- The reports could emphasize that the hardcoded SECRET_KEY, while insecure, is not malicious.  \n- If this code were to be used in production, the risk would be higher, but in the context of these reports, the low scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** approximately 0.2, reflecting insecure practice but no active threat.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their analysis. The code is benign, with the main concern being insecure secret management, which is typical in test or development environments.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI agree with the provided scores and analysis. No adjustments needed. The code is safe from a security and malware perspective, and the scores accurately reflect the current state.",
