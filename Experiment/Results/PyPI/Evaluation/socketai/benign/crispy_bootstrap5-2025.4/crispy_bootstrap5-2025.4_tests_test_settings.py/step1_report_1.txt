  "purpose": "Configuration settings for a Django web application, including installed apps, database setup, middleware, templates, and other settings.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), os.path.abspath(__file__), and hardcoded string values such as SECRET_KEY and INSTALLED_APPS",
  "sinks": "None identified; configuration values are standard and do not process untrusted input",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from source to sink; static configuration only",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded SECRET_KEY; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present; no suspicious network activity or malicious logic detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django settings module with no dynamic input handling or external data fetching. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded, which is insecure but not malicious or an attack vector itself. There are no sources of untrusted input, no dangerous code patterns, or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The configuration appears typical for a test or development environment. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malware are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Django settings file with standard configuration, minimal security concerns aside from the hardcoded SECRET_KEY which is acceptable in a test environment but insecure for production. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
