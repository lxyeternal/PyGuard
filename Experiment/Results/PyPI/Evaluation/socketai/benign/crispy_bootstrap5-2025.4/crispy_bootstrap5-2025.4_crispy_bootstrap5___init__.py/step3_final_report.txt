  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, indicating the software version.",
  "sources": "Static assignment in the code; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static assignment is isolated.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual future version '2025.4', which may be a typo or placeholder but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static assignment of a version string. No suspicious patterns, data flows, or malicious behaviors are present. The only anomaly is the future date '2025.4', which is likely a placeholder or typo but does not pose security risks. The code does not include any obfuscation, malicious network activity, or malicious code constructs. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a straightforward version assignment with no malicious or obfuscated content. The only minor concern is the future date in the version string, which is not a security issue but possibly a placeholder or typo. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are absent, and the minimal security risk is justified as zero.",
