  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send data to any sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code simply assigns a version string.",
  "anomalies": "The version string indicates a year in the future (2025), which is unusual but not malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a string to the __version__ variable. There are no functions, data flows, external inputs, or suspicious behaviors present. The future year in the version might be unconventional, but it does not imply malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple version assignment statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The only notable aspect is the future year in the version string, which is likely a typo or intentional versioning choice but not harmful.",
