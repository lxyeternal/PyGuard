  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment to the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted sources; static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual version number '2025.4', which is in the future, may indicate placeholder or malicious intent to mislead.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a string '2025.4' to the variable __version__. No external input, data processing, or functions are present. The version string appears to be a future date, which could be a placeholder, a mistake, or an attempt to mislead about the release date. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior. The absence of other code limits the scope of analysis, but based solely on this line, there are no security issues or malware indications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version assignment with an unusual future date. No malicious behavior is evident. The high version number may warrant further review for intent, but on its own, it poses no security threat.",
