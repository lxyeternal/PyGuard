  "purpose": "Define custom form layout classes for Bootstrap 5 using crispy-forms, including Accordion, FloatingField, and Switch components.",
  "sources": "Import statements for crispy_forms.bootstrap and crispy_forms.layout; class constructors and attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code primarily sets templates and initializes class attributes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; class constructors assign static or configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom form layout components for use with crispy-forms and Bootstrap 5, including classes for accordion menus and toggle switches. The methods and attributes only involve setting templates and configuration flags. There are no input data handling, network operations, or system modifications. No suspicious patterns, dynamic code execution, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of form layout components for a web interface, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
