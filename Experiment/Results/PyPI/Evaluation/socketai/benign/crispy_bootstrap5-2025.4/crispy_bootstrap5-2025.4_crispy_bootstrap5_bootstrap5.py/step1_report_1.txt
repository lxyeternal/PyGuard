  "purpose": "Define custom form fields and accordion components for Bootstrap 5 using Crispy Forms in Django.",
  "sources": "Imports from crispy_forms.bootstrap and crispy_forms.layout; class attributes and __init__ methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily sets up UI components.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns detected. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code creates subclasses for form components, setting templates and configuring behavior. It modifies internal attributes like 'flush' and 'always_open' based on constructor arguments. The logic appears straightforward, with no evidence of malicious intent. There are no input reads, no network operations, or data leaks. The code strictly defines UI layout elements, which are safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, standard customization of form components for UI layout. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are detected.",
