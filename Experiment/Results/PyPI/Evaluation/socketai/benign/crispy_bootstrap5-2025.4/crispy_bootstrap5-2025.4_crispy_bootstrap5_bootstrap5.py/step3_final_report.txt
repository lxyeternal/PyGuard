{
  "purpose": "Defines custom form components and layout classes for Bootstrap 5 using crispy_forms in Django.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and attribute assignments within the code, such as setting templates and managing configuration flags.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network communication, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of classes leading to setting templates and configuration flags; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward subclassing of crispy_forms components, setting templates, and managing configuration flags. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The only subtle point is the iteration over self.fields in BS5Accordion, which is consistent with crispy_forms design. No security flaws, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and justified by the code's purpose and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely for UI layout customization, with no malicious or security risks. The reports accurately assess the code's safety, and the scoring is consistent with its straightforward nature.",
