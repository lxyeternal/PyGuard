  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines custom form fields and accordion components for Bootstrap 5 using Crispy Forms.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report states the code is straightforward, with no malicious intent, data handling, or external communication.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The code only creates subclasses setting templates and configuration flags. No untrusted data, no network, no code execution. The report's conclusion is consistent with the code.  \n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining UI components with static templates.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic code, no external data, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is purely UI layout definitions, with no signs of malicious behavior.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring and conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines form layout components, including an accordion and switches.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No input handling, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The code only sets templates and flags.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is safe, straightforward, and intended for UI purposes only.  \n**Verdict:** Scores and conclusion are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, defining custom classes for Bootstrap 5 layout.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity, no dynamic code, no external data. The code modifies class attributes based on constructor arguments.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly less than perfect confidence, but still consistent. No issues detected.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines form components, including an accordion, with template assignments.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No input handling, no external data, no malicious behavior. The code is purely for UI customization.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is safe, and the report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** None. All reports confirm the code is for UI layout customization, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No logical flaws or reasoning errors detected.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are zero, reflecting no malicious activity. Security risk scores are zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Scores:** Since all code is purely for UI layout, a risk score higher than 0.1 would be unwarranted. The highest confidence is 1, and all scores are appropriate.\n- **Malware Score Justification:** Zero across all reports is justified; no malware or malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all are justified as safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimum, since it's UI code, but generally safe)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security risks or malware. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.",
