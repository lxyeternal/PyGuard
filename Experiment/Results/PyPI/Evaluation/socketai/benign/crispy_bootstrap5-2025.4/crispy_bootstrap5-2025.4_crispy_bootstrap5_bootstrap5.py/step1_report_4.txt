  "purpose": "Define custom form layout classes for Bootstrap 5 using crispy_forms, including an accordion, floating fields, and switches.",
  "sources": "Import statements for crispy_forms.bootstrap.Accordion and crispy_forms.layout.Field; class initializations; self.fields iteration.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code primarily defines classes and initializes properties.",
  "flows": "Initialization of classes and setting properties (flush, always_open) based on arguments; iteration over self.fields to set always_open.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The code appears straightforward and related to UI layout customization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom classes: FloatingField, BS5Accordion, and Switch, extending existing crispy_forms components for Bootstrap 5 layout purposes. The BS5Accordion class conditionally sets the always_open property for its contained accordion groups if specified. All operations are typical for form layout definitions, with no dynamic code execution, data processing, or external data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard UI layout customization for Django crispy_forms with Bootstrap 5. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. It simply extends form layout classes and sets properties based on input arguments.",
