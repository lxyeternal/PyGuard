  "purpose": "Define custom form layout components for use with crispy_forms and Bootstrap5, including a floating field, an accordion container, and a switch toggle.",
  "sources": "Imports from crispy_forms.bootstrap and crispy_forms.layout modules; class initializations; string templates for rendering.",
  "sinks": "Rendering templates that may include untrusted data, but templates are static file paths, not dynamic or executable code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from form field definitions through class initializations to templates for rendering the form components.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses for form layout components, setting templates and attributes for rendering. It includes a constructor that manages 'always_open' property for accordion groups. No external data inputs, network calls, or security-sensitive operations are present. Templates are static file paths. The code appears straightforward and intended for UI layout purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard UI component definitions for form layout using crispy_forms and Bootstrap5. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are evident.",
