  "purpose": "Define custom form fields and an accordion component for Bootstrap 5 using crispy_forms.",
  "sources": "Imports from crispy_forms.bootstrap and crispy_forms.layout, class attributes, and constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of templates to class attributes, modification of fields within the constructor.",
  "flows": "Imports lead to class definitions, class attributes set templates, constructor modifies fields based on parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network calls or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports form layout components and defines custom form field classes for Bootstrap 5 styling. The FloatingField and Switch classes assign specific templates, which is typical for customizing form appearance. The BS5Accordion class extends an accordion component, allowing configuration of 'flush' and 'always_open' features, and sets 'always_open' for its fields if specified. There are no input sources that could be manipulated, no insecure data handling, and no code that could be used maliciously. The code appears purely for UI component customization without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is for customizing form UI components with Bootstrap 5 and does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and intended for aesthetic and functional form improvements.",
