  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom form components and layout classes for Bootstrap 5 using crispy_forms in Django.\n- The code involves subclassing existing classes, setting templates, and configuring properties like `flush` and `always_open`.\n- No reports mention any dynamic data handling, network activity, input processing, or other behaviors that could be malicious.\n- The code appears to be purely for UI layout customization, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n\n**Confirming issues in the code:**\n- The code snippets are straightforward class definitions extending crispy_forms components.\n- No issues are present in the code itself; it functions as intended for UI customization.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The code correctly manages class attributes and constructor parameters.\n- No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns, are detected.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating the reviewers are certain about their assessments.\n- The `obfuscated` scores are 0, which is correct.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- Since there is no malicious activity, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The code is standard UI component setup, with no evidence of supply chain compromise.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they focus on the code's purpose and behavior.\n- No dynamic code execution or external data handling is present.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The scores given are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is purely for UI layout customization.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious activity detected.\n- The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or modify system state.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate; the code is safe and legitimate. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
