{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for django-crispy-forms, verifying layout rendering, unicode handling, missing fields, formsets, internationalization, CSS classes, and template output.",
  "sources": "Form fields, layout components, context variables ('message', 'flag'), and template variables used during rendering.",
  "sinks": "HTML output generated via template rendering, with potential untrusted data in form IDs, labels, and context variables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from form fields and context variables into HTML templates; context variables like 'message' and 'flag' could potentially inject malicious content if unescaped.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation. Use of standard functions like '_get_new_csrf_string' is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard test suite for Django forms with crispy-forms, involving rendering, layout, internationalization, and formset handling. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Template variables are used in a controlled manner, and no unsafe operations are present. The potential for injection exists only if untrusted data is passed unchecked, but the code itself does not introduce or execute malicious content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe testing suite with no malicious activity or security risks detected. The scores are consistent with its benign nature.",
