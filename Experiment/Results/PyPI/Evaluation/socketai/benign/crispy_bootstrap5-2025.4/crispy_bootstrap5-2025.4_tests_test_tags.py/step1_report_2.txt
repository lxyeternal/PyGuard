{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test functions for Django forms and crispy forms integration, verifying template rendering, error handling, and form behaviors.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from SampleForm instances, formset data, and template contexts. Data is read from form fields, formsets, and template variables.",
  "sinks": "Rendered HTML output is the main sink. The code does not write to files, execute external commands, or send data over the network.",
  "flows": "Input data from forms and formsets flow through validation and template rendering, resulting in HTML output. No suspicious data flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors are observed. The code primarily uses standard Django and crispy forms features. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django test suite for form rendering and error display, using pytest and Django templates. It performs validation checks, template rendering, and exception handling with expected behaviors. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are identified. The use of third-party libraries appears standard and appropriate. No suspicious data flows, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code snippets are present. The code operates within the normal scope of Django testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Django test suite focused on form rendering and error handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain attacks within this code segment.",
