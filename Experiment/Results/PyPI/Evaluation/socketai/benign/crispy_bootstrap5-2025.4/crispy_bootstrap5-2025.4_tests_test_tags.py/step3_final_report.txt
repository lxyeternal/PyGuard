{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive set of Django unit tests for crispy forms, validating rendering, error handling, and template tags/filters.",
  "sources": "Form data inputs, template context variables, form fields, formsets, and widget attributes.",
  "sinks": "HTML output rendered in templates; no external system interactions or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from form submissions and context variables into template rendering, with validation results influencing output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Django form and formset validation tests, rendering checks, and template tag/filter validations. It does not execute external commands, write files, or perform network operations. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The test suite is typical for verifying form rendering and error display, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely for testing Django crispy forms functionality. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects the test nature and lack of external interactions.",
