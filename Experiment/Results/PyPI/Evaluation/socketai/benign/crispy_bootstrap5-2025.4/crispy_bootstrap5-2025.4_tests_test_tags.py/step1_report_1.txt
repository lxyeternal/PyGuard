{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test cases for Django crispy forms and formsets, verifying rendering and behavior of templates, form validation, and custom filters/tags.",
  "sources": "User input via form data, template rendering context, form field attributes.",
  "sinks": "Template rendering outputs, form validation status, form errors, and exceptions.",
  "flows": "Form data input → form validation → template rendering → output HTML. No data flows into external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no code that writes data to network or system files; no obfuscated code; no suspicious dynamic execution or code eval; no backdoors, external connections, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Django form tests and template rendering checks. It uses standard Django and crispy forms functionality. No input/output flows suggest malicious intent. The code includes template loading, rendering, and assertions for expected HTML output. There are no hardcoded secrets, no external network calls, and no suspicious code behavior. All tests are for validating UI and form behavior, with no indication of malicious or sabotage code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign set of Django crispy forms tests. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided content. It strictly tests rendering and form validation functionalities without malicious actions.",
