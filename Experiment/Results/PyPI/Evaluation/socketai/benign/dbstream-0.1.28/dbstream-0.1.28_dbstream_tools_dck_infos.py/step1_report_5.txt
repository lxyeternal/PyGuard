{
  "purpose": "Generate unique identifiers and timestamp metadata for each row of input data, optionally associating a batch ID.",
  "sources": "row_data input parameter, specifically reading existing keys within each row (e.g., '__dck_id___', '__dck_inserted_at___', '__dck_batch_id___').",
  "sinks": "Modifies the input rows by adding or updating specific keys; no external data sinks or outputs are used.",
  "flows": "Reads existing row data; conditionally assigns UUIDs, timestamps, and batch IDs; updates rows in-place; appends updated rows to result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or external network activity. The use of UUIDs and timestamps is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code imports datetime and uuid modules for generating timestamps and UUIDs. The function iterates through each row in row_data, assigning new UUIDs and timestamps if certain keys are missing. It also adds batch_id if provided. The logic is straightforward, with no external communications, data leaks, or malicious behavior. No security vulnerabilities such as injection or sensitive data handling issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for augmenting data rows with identifiers and timestamps. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
