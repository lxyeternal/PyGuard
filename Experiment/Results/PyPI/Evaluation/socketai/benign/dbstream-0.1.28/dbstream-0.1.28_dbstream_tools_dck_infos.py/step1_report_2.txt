  "purpose": "The function generates unique identifiers and timestamp information for each row in a dataset, optionally associating a batch ID.",
  "sources": "Reads from the 'row_data' input, accessing and modifying dictionary entries within each row.",
  "sinks": "Modifies input dictionaries in-place; no external data or system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Reads data from 'row_data' -> adds/modifies UUID and timestamp fields -> returns modified data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions. No external network or system interactions observed.",
  "analysis": "The code iterates through each item in 'row_data', generating UUIDs for missing ID fields and assigning current timestamps if not present. It also adds a batch ID when provided. The use of 'uuid.uuid4()' for unique ID generation and 'datetime.datetime.now()' for timestamps is standard. No malicious or suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is evident. The code operates solely on the provided data structures, with no external side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs straightforward data augmentation with UUIDs and timestamps, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for data processing tasks.",
