  "purpose": "Generate and assign unique identifiers, timestamps, and batch IDs to rows of data.",
  "sources": "row_data input parameter, specifically reading existing keys such as '__dck_id___', '__dck_inserted_at___', and '__dck_batch_id___'.",
  "sinks": "Modifications to the row dictionary, specifically setting new UUIDs, timestamps, and batch IDs.",
  "flows": "Reads existing keys from row_data; if missing, generates UUIDs and timestamps; assigns batch_id if provided; returns modified list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. Uses standard libraries for UUID and datetime. No suspicious data leaks or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code function iterates through a list of data rows, adding UUIDs and timestamps if missing, and optionally adding a batch ID. It employs standard Python libraries (uuid and datetime) for generating identifiers and timestamps, which are common and not malicious. The logic is straightforward and intended for data augmentation. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for augmenting data rows with identifiers and timestamps. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The purpose appears to be legitimate data processing, with no security risks or malware identified.",
