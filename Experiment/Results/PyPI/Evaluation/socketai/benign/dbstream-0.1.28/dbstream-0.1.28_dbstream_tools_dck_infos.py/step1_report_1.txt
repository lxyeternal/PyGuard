{
  "purpose": "The function generates or updates unique identifiers and timestamps in each dictionary within a list of data rows, optionally associating a batch ID.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'row_data' (list of dicts), optional 'batch_id' parameter.",
  "sinks": "In-place modification of the input data structures by adding or updating keys.",
  "flows": "Reads from each dictionary in 'row_data', writes back updated values into the same dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external data access, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code. Uses standard libraries in a typical manner.",
  "analysis": "The code iterates through a list of dictionaries, generating UUIDs for missing identifiers and adding timestamps if absent. It conditionally adds a batch ID if provided. All operations use standard library functions (datetime and uuid). The data modifications are straightforward and do not involve any external or malicious behavior. No suspicious network activity, no credential theft, no hidden backdoors, and no suspicious obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard data processing tasks related to adding unique IDs and timestamps. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for data annotation or tracking purposes.",
