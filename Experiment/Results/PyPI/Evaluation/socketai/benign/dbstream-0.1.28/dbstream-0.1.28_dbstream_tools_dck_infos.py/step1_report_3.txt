{
  "purpose": "Generate unique identifiers and timestamps for each row of data, possibly for tracking or database insertion.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'row_data' (list of dicts), optional 'batch_id'",
  "sinks": "Modifies input rows in-place; no external data output or network activity",
  "flows": "Reads 'row_data' entries; assigns UUIDs and timestamps; adds batch_id if provided",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscated patterns; uses standard library functions",
  "analysis": "The code iterates over provided data rows, assigns UUIDs and timestamps if missing, and optionally adds a batch ID. It uses standard libraries (datetime, uuid) securely and does not perform any network or file operations. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident; the code is straightforward and intended for data augmentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing data annotation with UUIDs and timestamps for record identification. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
