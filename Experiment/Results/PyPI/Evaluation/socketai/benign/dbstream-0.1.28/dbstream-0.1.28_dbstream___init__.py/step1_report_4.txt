  "purpose": "Import the DBStream class from the dbstream.DBStream module, likely for streaming database data.",
  "sources": "The import statement, which loads a class from an external module.",
  "sinks": "None present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "No data flow in this single line, just module import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the import appears standard.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a simple import of a class from an external package. No executable logic, data processing, or input/output operations are present. The package 'dbstream' and class 'DBStream' are not inherently suspicious but should be checked in the context of its use. As is, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It alone does not pose any security risk.",
