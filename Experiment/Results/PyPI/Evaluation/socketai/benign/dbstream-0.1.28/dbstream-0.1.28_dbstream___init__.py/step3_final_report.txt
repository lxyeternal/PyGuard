  "purpose": "Import the DBStream class from the dbstream.DBStream module, likely for data streaming or database interaction.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as the code only imports a class without further usage.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing a class from a module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. The import is standard and does not execute any code or handle data directly. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of this minimal code snippet. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. Without additional context or usage, this code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
