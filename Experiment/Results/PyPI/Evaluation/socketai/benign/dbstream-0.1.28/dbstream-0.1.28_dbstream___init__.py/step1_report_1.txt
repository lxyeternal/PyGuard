  "purpose": "Import the DBStream class from the dbstream module, likely for streaming or database operations.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from the module 'dbstream' and the 'DBStream' class within it.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed in this single line; potential usage of DBStream occurs elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies or suspicious behavior present in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external module, which is standard practice. Without additional context or usage, there's no indication of malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or suspicious constructs are visible. This is a straightforward import statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is likely part of a larger project where DBStream is used for database streaming or data processing.",
