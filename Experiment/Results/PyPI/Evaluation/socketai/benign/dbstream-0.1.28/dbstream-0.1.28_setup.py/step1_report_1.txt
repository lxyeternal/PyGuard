{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure a Python package named 'dbstream' with its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; hardcoded package metadata (name, version, author, etc.); dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "Dependencies installation (requests, google-api-core, dacktool), which could be exploited if malicious versions are injected; reading local file 'README.md' (though safe if file is controlled).",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content as long_description; package setup process installs dependencies; no untrusted data sources that influence code flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for packaging, reads a local 'README.md' for description, and defines package metadata and dependencies. No user input, network operations, or suspicious code are present. Dependencies are standard and version-locked, reducing supply chain risk. No embedded code, malicious commands, or obfuscated content detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical for Python package distribution.",
