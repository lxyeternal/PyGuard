{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python package setup script using setuptools, intended to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description; static package metadata and dependencies specified in code.",
  "sinks": "Installation of dependencies; no untrusted data or external network activity occurs.",
  "flows": "Static data used for package configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script that reads a local README file and defines package metadata and dependencies. It does not perform any dynamic operations, network calls, or execute untrusted code. Dependencies are explicitly specified with version constraints, reducing supply chain risks. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. All signals indicate a benign, standard package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
