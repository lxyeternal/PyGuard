  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'dbstream', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; no other data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reading file -> setting up package configuration; no untrusted data flows or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup procedures are followed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations using setuptools, including reading a README file for description and specifying dependencies. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior is present. Dependencies are typical for a Python package, and no external network connections or data leaks are evident. The code structure is straightforward and aligns with common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
