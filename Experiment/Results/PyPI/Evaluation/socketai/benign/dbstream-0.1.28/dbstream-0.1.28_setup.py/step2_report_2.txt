  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a standard Python package setup script using setuptools.\n- It reads a local README.md file for long description.\n- It specifies package metadata and dependencies explicitly.\n- No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- Dependencies are common packages with fixed version constraints.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1 Analysis**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the setup purpose; reads README.md.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flow; static data used.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is straightforward and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Security risk 0, Confidence 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2 Analysis**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the absence of external input or malicious behavior.\n- Correctly notes the dependencies are benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Security risk 0, Confidence 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3 Analysis**\n- Also aligns with previous assessments.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Security risk 0, Confidence 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4 Analysis**\n- Same conclusion: standard setup, no suspicious activity.\n- No anomalies or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Security risk 0, Confidence 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5 Analysis**\n- Consistent with others, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- Correctly states the script is benign and standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Security risk 0, Confidence 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Justification**\n- **Code content:** Purely a standard setup script, no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity or code)\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n  - **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nAll reports are consistent with the code. The scores are appropriate given the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and should be adjusted if any scores differ, but currently, they are correct.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always consider that supply chain risks could emerge from malicious dependencies or future modifications, but based on the current code and reports, the assessment is that the package is safe.",
