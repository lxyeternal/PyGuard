{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'dbstream' with specified metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; no external input sources that accept untrusted data are used in a way that affects security.",
  "sinks": "The setup function writes package metadata and dependencies; no sinks process untrusted data in a security-sensitive manner.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks that could cause security issues; data read from 'README.md' is static and used for description purposes only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or malicious behavior are present. The dependencies are standard packages with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward setup of a Python package using setuptools, including reading a README file for description. The dependencies listed are common and benign. No external data inputs are processed in a manner that poses a security risk. The code lacks any suspicious code constructs, obfuscated code, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package.",
