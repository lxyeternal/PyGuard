  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for the Python package 'dbstream', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; static package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or untrusted inputs used in the code.",
  "flows": "Reading file content, then passing static data to setuptools.setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools', reads a README file for the long description, and configures package metadata and dependencies using 'setuptools.setup'. The dependencies are static and well-defined. No input from untrusted sources or user input, no network communication, no code injection or obfuscation. The structure follows standard Python packaging practices without signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a normal, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard package configuration without any suspicious or malicious code.",
