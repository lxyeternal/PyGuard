{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to search for specific SQL keywords in a query string and replace the table names with modified versions that include a schema suffix.",
  "sources": "The 'query' parameter, which is a string input representing an SQL query.",
  "sinks": "The re.sub function modifies the input 'query' string by replacing matched table names with altered names.",
  "flows": "Input 'query' is processed by re.finditer to identify patterns, and then re.sub applies replacements based on those matches.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. It performs pattern matching and string substitution without executing external code or system commands. The regex is straightforward for pattern matching SQL clauses and table names.",
  "analysis": "The script compiles a regex to match SQL keywords (FROM, JOIN, INTO, USING) followed by whitespace and a table name (word characters), including a period and another word (table.column). It iterates over matches, logs details of each match, including position and matched groups, then performs a substitution replacing the table name with the original name appended with an underscore and a schema suffix. No external data is read or sent, no code injection, no malicious behavior detected. It is a utility function for query transformation, not malware or an attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs safe pattern matching and string substitution to modify SQL queries by appending a schema suffix to table names. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility for query manipulation.",
