  "purpose": "The code searches for specific SQL keywords in a query string and replaces table names by appending a schema suffix.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'query' (a string), and 'schema_suffix_to_add' (a string), provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "The re.sub() call that modifies the input query string with the appended schema suffix.",
  "flows": "Input 'query' and 'schema_suffix_to_add' are used to generate a modified query string, with the pattern matching and replacement performed via regex.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code uses regex for string substitution without executing any external commands or handling untrusted input insecurely.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a regex pattern to locate specific SQL keywords followed by table names. It then iterates over all matches, logs details about each match, and performs a replacement to append a suffix to table names. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The code only processes strings and performs standard regex operations. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The logic appears to be for query rewriting or logging, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for modifying SQL queries by appending a schema suffix. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is straightforward, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
