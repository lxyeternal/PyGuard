{
  "purpose": "To identify and modify table and schema names in SQL queries by appending a specified suffix to schema names following specific SQL clauses.",
  "sources": "The input SQL query string, specifically the parts matching the regex pattern for clauses (FROM, JOIN, INTO, USING) followed by schema and table names.",
  "sinks": "The re.sub operation that replaces matched patterns with modified schema names, effectively altering the query string.",
  "flows": "The regex finds patterns in the query string (source), then the re.sub replaces these patterns with the schema name appended with the suffix (sink), resulting in a modified query.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, external code execution, network activity, or handling of secrets. The regex assumes simple schema.table patterns and does not handle complex SQL syntax or nested queries.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a static regex to locate specific SQL clauses followed by schema and table names, logs match details, and performs a string substitution to append a suffix to the schema name. It operates solely on strings with no external data access or malicious payloads. The regex is simple and effective for basic queries but may not handle complex SQL syntax. The logging is benign, and the substitution is safe. No vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk, unobfuscated) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for SQL query string modification, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and justified.",
