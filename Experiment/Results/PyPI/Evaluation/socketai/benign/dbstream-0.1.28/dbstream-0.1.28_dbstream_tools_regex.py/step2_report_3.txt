  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- All reports agree that the code performs pattern matching on SQL queries to find specific clauses (FROM, JOIN, INTO, USING) followed by schema and table names.\n- The code then logs details and replaces the table/schema name with an appended suffix.\n- There are no indications of code execution, external data access, or malicious payloads.\n- The regex is straightforward and targeted; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports consistently state that the code is benign, straightforward, and safe.\n- They correctly identify that the code only manipulates strings and regex matches, with no malicious activity.\n- No report mentions any technical inaccuracies or overlooked issues.\n\n**3. Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly around 0.1 to 0.2), consistent with a utility that modifies SQL queries.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), reflecting agreement on the benign nature.\n- The scores seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.2; all are low.\n- The code does not perform dangerous operations, access external systems, or contain vulnerabilities.\n- Therefore, higher risk scores are unjustified.\n\n**5. Malware Score Reflection:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or intent.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All reports are cautious and avoid assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a utility for query modification.\n- No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n- The scores align well with the described analysis.\n- No inconsistencies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n**Should be 0.** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n**Should be 0.** The code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n**Should be around 0.1 to 0.2.** Given the utility nature and lack of security issues, a low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, straightforward utility for SQL query modification, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My final estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed scoring breakdown or further analysis.",
