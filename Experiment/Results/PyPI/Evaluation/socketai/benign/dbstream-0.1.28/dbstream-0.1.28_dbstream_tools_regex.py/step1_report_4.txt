{
  "purpose": "The code searches for specific SQL keywords in a query and replaces the schema names with an appended suffix.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'query' provided to the function 'replace_query_details'.",
  "sinks": "The re.sub function that modifies the 'query' string using the regex pattern.",
  "flows": "The function takes 'query' as input, searches for pattern matches, logs details about each match, and then replaces schema names in the query string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of regex for SQL query string manipulation is standard. No suspicious network activity or system calls present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a regex pattern to identify specific SQL clauses (FROM, JOIN, INTO, USING) followed by schema and table names. It iterates over matches, records their positions and matched groups, and constructs log details. Finally, it performs a substitution to append a schema suffix to identified schema names. No external data sources, environment variables, or network activity are involved. The code appears to be a utility for query modification with no malicious intent. It operates solely on input strings and does not perform any dangerous actions or access sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe utility for pattern matching and string replacement within SQL queries. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is straightforward and appears to be intended for schema name modification in queries.",
