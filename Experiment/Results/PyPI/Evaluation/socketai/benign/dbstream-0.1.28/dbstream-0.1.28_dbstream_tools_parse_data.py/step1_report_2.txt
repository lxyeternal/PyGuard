{
  "purpose": "The code processes and transforms JSON data, unnesting nested dictionaries/lists, and generating data structure info for further use.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from function parameters, JSON strings within data fields, and dictionary/list structures within rows.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable to malicious JSON data that could cause exceptions or unexpected behavior during json.loads() calls, but no direct data leaks or external effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from parameters; json.loads() is used to parse string fields; data is modified/unnested; results are assembled and returned.",
  "anomalies": "Uses json.loads() on string fields without explicit validation; recursive function calls could lead to infinite recursion if cyclic data exists, but unlikely with typical data; no hardcoded credentials or secret keys detected; no network or system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data transformation by unnesting nested dictionaries/lists and generating structured info. It employs json.loads() to parse string fields, which could raise exceptions if the data is maliciously crafted to cause resource exhaustion or errors, but this is standard. No external system interactions, network calls, or system modifications are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious data manipulations are evident. The code relies on proper input data formatting and contains standard JSON processing logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard JSON data processing utility with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It could potentially be affected by maliciously crafted JSON data, but no direct malicious behavior is present. Overall security risks are low.",
