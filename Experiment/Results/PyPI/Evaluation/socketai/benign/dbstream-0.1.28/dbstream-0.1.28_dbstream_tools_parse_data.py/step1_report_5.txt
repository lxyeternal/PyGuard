  "purpose": "The code processes JSON data, unpacks nested structures, and generates DCK info for data integration or transformation tasks.",
  "sources": "Data read from the input parameter 'data', specifically 'data['data']' and its nested JSON fields.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies the 'row_data' in-place, including JSON parsing and nested data restructuring. No direct output or external network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'data' input → JSON parsing and nested data unpacking → modified 'row_data' and generated nested tables → returned as 'list_of_tables_to_send'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of json.loads within try-except blocks for string fields; recursive calls to 'treat_json_data'; no explicit validation or sanitization of JSON content. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script processes nested JSON structures, unpacks dictionaries and lists, and generates structured data for further processing. It uses json.loads to parse string fields into JSON objects and recursively unpacks nested data. No network calls, file operations, or other side-effects are observed. The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions such as data exfiltration or command execution. The recursive approach and JSON parsing are standard data processing techniques without indications of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data processing utility for JSON normalization and transformation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only concern is that recursive processing might be inefficient with extremely large or deeply nested data, but it does not introduce security issues.",
