  "purpose": "Process and flatten nested JSON data, unnest dictionaries and lists, and generate structured info for downstream use.",
  "sources": "Reading input JSON strings, accessing nested dicts/lists within data fields.",
  "sinks": "Potentially parsing untrusted JSON strings with json.loads(), which could cause resource exhaustion or exceptions if payloads are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "JSON string fields (sources) are parsed via json.loads(), then nested structures are flattened or unnested, modifying data in-place.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected. Recursive JSON processing could be exploited for resource exhaustion but is standard behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs recursive unnesting of JSON data, parsing string fields with json.loads(), and generating additional info via generate_dck_info. No external system calls or network activity are present. The main security concern is resource exhaustion via deeply nested or large JSON payloads, which could lead to denial-of-service. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The use of json.loads() on untrusted data is standard but could be exploited in edge cases. The code's structure is clear, and no suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard JSON unnesting utility with no malicious intent. The primary risk is resource exhaustion if fed maliciously crafted JSON data. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The security risk score of approximately 0.2 reflects the potential for resource exhaustion but does not indicate active malicious behavior.",
