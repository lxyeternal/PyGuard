  "conclusion": "The code is a standard JSON unnesting utility with no malicious intent. The primary risk is resource exhaustion if fed maliciously crafted JSON data. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The security risk score of approximately 0.2 reflects the potential for resource exhaustion but does not indicate active malicious behavior."
