{
  "purpose": "Define a class containing ANSI escape sequences for colored terminal output",
  "sources": "No data input sources; static class attributes",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output beyond static variable definitions",
  "flows": "No data flows; class attributes are static constants",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'C' with multiple class variables representing ANSI escape codes used for colored terminal text formatting. These are static string constants and do not involve any input processing, data handling, or external communication. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code. The code appears to be for UI formatting purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward definition of ANSI color codes for terminal output. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
