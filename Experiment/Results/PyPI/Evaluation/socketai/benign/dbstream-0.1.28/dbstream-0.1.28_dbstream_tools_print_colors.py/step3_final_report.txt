  "purpose": "Define static ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling",
  "sources": "Static class variables assigned to ANSI escape code strings",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external data handling",
  "flows": "None; static constants without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static definitions",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple class defining static string constants for ANSI escape sequences used for terminal styling. It contains no functions, input handling, dynamic behavior, or external interactions. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is purely cosmetic and static, with no data flows or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility class for terminal styling with no security or malicious concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
