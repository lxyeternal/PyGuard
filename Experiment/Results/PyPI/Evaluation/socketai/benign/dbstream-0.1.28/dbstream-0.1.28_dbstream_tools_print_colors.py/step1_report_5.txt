  "purpose": "Define a class containing ANSI escape codes for terminal text formatting and coloring.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reads present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions that process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of static string constants for terminal styling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class C with several class variables representing ANSI escape codes for styling terminal output. There are no functions, input handling, or dynamic code execution. The constants are standard and well-known for terminal color formatting. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be purely cosmetic, intended for styling output in a terminal environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to provide styling constants for terminal output. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
