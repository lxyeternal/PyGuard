  "purpose": "Define a class containing ANSI escape codes for terminal text formatting.",
  "sources": "Class attributes that are string literals representing escape sequences.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows to external systems or untrusted outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the class only contains static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only defines constants.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'C' with multiple class attributes representing ANSI escape sequences for formatting terminal output. These attributes are static strings used for coloring and styling terminal text, with no input handling, external data access, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a utility module for styling terminal output, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility class defining terminal formatting escape sequences. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward implementation for styling terminal output.",
