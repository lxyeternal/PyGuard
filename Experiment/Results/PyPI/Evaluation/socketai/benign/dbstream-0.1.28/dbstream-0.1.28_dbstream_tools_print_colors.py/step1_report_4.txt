  "purpose": "Define a class containing ANSI escape sequences for colored terminal output.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions that assign escape sequences to variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow leading to external systems or sensitive data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; just static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with static string variables representing ANSI escape codes for colored text formatting. It consists solely of static attribute assignments, with no input reading, no data processing, no external network or file operations, and no dynamic code execution. The purpose appears to be for styling terminal output. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility class for terminal text styling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
