  "conclusion": "The majority of code appears benign with no malicious intent, supported by low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5's indicators of obfuscation and dynamic execution warrant higher suspicion, which is accurately reflected in its scores. Overall, the supply chain risk remains low, with a need for further review of suspicious components before deployment."
