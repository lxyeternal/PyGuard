{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a simple utility script intended to perform a specific task, possibly related to data processing or system information gathering.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly defined; potential sources could include environment variables or external input functions if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could involve network transmission, file writing, or execution commands, but no such actions are explicitly observed.",
  "flows": "No clear data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is detected; the code primarily performs internal calculations or checks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors such as network activity, file tampering, or system modification are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard Python syntax. It does not include external library calls that could indicate malicious behavior. No signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors are present. The absence of network operations, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation routines suggests low malicious potential. Overall, the script appears benign, serving a specific, likely legitimate purpose.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is simple, transparent, and free of anomalies or suspicious activity. Therefore, it can be considered safe with high confidence.",
