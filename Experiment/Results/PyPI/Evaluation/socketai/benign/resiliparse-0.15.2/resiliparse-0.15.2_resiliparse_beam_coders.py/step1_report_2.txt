  "purpose": "Define a subclass of apache_beam.coders.StrUtf8Coder that uses a custom decoding method for improved resilience to encoding errors.",
  "sources": "Import of bytes_to_str function from resiliparse.parse.encoding, usage within decode method",
  "sinks": "decode method returns the result of bytes_to_str, which is a string; no data leakage or external effect observed",
  "flows": "bytes_to_str function receives input 'value' and encoding 'utf-8', returns a decoded string",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code; simple subclass extension",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and external libraries, defines a subclass of a known Beam coder, and overrides the decode method to use a custom decoding function. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful side effects. The usage of a custom decoding function suggests an intent to improve robustness, not malicious intent. The code appears straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign extension of a standard Beam coder with no malicious or suspicious elements. It is designed to enhance error handling during decoding. No security risks are detected.",
