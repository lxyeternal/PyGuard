  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign extension aimed at improving decoding error resilience. There is no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation. The scores across reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and security risk scores are negligible. The code poses no security threat and is safe for use."
