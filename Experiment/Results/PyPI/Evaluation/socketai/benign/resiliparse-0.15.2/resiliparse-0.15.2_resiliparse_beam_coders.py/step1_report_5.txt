{
  "purpose": "Define a custom UTF-8 string encoder/decoder class for Apache Beam that handles encoding errors gracefully.",
  "sources": "Imports from apache_beam.coders and resiliparse.parse.encoding; the decode method uses the bytes_to_str function which processes input data.",
  "sinks": "The decode method processes input data which could be from untrusted sources if used in a larger pipeline.",
  "flows": "Input bytes → decode method → bytes_to_str function → decoded string output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no external network interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code extends an existing Apache Beam coder to improve robustness against encoding errors, utilizing a helper function for conversion. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are present. The imports and class methods are straightforward and serve a well-defined purpose. No suspicious flow or anomaly detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-specific extension of a standard library, aimed at improving error handling during string decoding. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
