{
  "purpose": "Define a subclass of apache_beam.coders.StrUtf8Coder with enhanced error handling for decoding byte strings using a custom encoding helper.",
  "sources": "Imports from apache_beam and resiliparse modules, usage of bytes_to_str in decode method.",
  "fires": "The decode method uses bytes_to_str, which processes input data.",
  "flows": "Input bytes passed to decode() are processed by bytes_to_str, potentially affecting how data is interpreted.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual behavior; uses custom decoding for robustness.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily extends an existing class to improve decoding error resilience by overriding decode(). It imports necessary modules and uses a helper function for string conversion. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The custom decode method may slightly alter data interpretation but is consistent with error handling. No external network access or dangerous actions are present. The code appears to be a benign extension to an existing library, with a clear focus on robust string decoding.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension aimed at improving decoding robustness. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are detected.",
