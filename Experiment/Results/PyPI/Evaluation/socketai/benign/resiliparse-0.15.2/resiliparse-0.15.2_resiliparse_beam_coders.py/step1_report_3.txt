{
  "purpose": "Define a custom UTF-8 string coder class that extends apache_beam's StrUtf8Coder with enhanced error handling, using resiliparse for decoding.",
  "sources": "Imports from apache_beam and resiliparse, class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "The decode method processes data for decoding but does not send data externally or perform any network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input data to decode method -> resiliparse's bytes_to_str -> return decoded string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns. The code relies on external libraries but does not perform any suspicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of apache_beam.coders.StrUtf8Coder, overriding the decode method to utilize resiliparse's bytes_to_str function for enhanced error resilience during decoding. It imports necessary modules, sets __all__ for export, and does not include any network operations, data leaks, or malicious logic. The code appears standard and focused on improving string decoding robustness, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign extension of a standard encoding class aimed at improving decoding robustness. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks present.",
