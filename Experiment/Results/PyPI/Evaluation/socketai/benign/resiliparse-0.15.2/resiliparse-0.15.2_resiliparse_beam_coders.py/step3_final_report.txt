{
  "purpose": "A subclass of apache_beam.coders.StrUtf8Coder that overrides decode() to use resiliparse.parse.encoding.bytes_to_str for more resilient decoding of UTF-8 strings.",
  "sources": "Input data passed to decode() method, specifically the 'value' parameter, which is expected to be bytes or byte-like object.",
  "sinks": "The output of decode(), which is a string; no external data transmission or untrusted sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "Input bytes -> decode() method -> bytes_to_str() -> output string; no external or network flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors. The code is straightforward and purpose-driven.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass that enhances error handling during UTF-8 decoding by replacing the default decode method with one that uses bytes_to_str. It imports standard and external libraries without any network activity or obfuscation. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (mostly 0, with a slight 0.1 in one report). The code's purpose is to improve robustness, not malicious activity. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The external library use is justified and not inherently risky. The overall structure and behavior indicate a safe, benign extension.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign extension aimed at improving decoding error resilience. There is no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation. The scores across reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and security risk scores are negligible. The code poses no security threat and is safe for use.",
