  "purpose": "Import core functions and classes related to encoding detection and HTTP chunk processing from local modules.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external input directly; it imports from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are evident in this static import context.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of license comments and static import statements from local modules. No data processing, user input handling, or dynamic code execution occurs here. The imported functions and classes are standard for modular code organization and do not exhibit malicious intent. The snippet appears to be part of a larger codebase focusing on encoding detection and HTTP processing.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code snippet. It functions as a standard module import segment with no suspicious activity.",
