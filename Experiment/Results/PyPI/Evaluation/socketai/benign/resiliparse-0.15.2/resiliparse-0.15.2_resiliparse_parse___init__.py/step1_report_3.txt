  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a larger library focused on encoding detection and HTTP chunk processing, likely for handling various data encodings and streaming HTTP data.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.encoding' and '.http', which provide functions related to encoding detection and HTTP data processing.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are visible in this snippet; the code primarily imports functions for later use. No data is being processed or transmitted here.",
  "flows": "There are no active data flows in this snippet; it only imports functions which may be used elsewhere in the module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments and import statements for specific functions from local modules. There are no operations, no input handling, or data processing in this fragment. The structure indicates compatibility considerations, but no malicious or security-related issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, performing only module imports related to encoding detection and HTTP data processing. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
