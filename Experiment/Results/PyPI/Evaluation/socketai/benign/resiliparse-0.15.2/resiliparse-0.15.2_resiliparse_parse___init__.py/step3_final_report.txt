  "purpose": "Static import statements for encoding detection and HTTP chunk processing modules, serving as a module header or initialization segment.",
  "sources": "Local modules `.encoding` and `.http` from which functions and classes are imported.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present in this static code snippet.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules at startup; no data flow or execution paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only license comments and import statements from local modules related to encoding detection and HTTP processing. There are no dynamic operations, data handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence, and assign malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements justify these assessments. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module header with safe import statements. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
