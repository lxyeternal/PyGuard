  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as only performing static import statements from local modules, with no data processing, user input, or network activity.\n- The code snippet contains only license comments and import statements, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n- The sources are local modules (.encoding and .http), which are standard in modular codebases and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code snippet itself. All reports agree on this.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None identified; the reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n  - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n  - Security risk scores are 0, which is justified.\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** None of the reports make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Score consistency:** The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code's content.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk in this static import segment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard module header with safe import statements, and there are no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep the scores as they are: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- No further action needed based on this snippet.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The reports are correct, and the scoring reflects the code's safety profile.",
