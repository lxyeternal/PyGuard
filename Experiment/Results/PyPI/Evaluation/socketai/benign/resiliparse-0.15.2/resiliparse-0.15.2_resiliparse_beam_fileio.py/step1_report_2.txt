  "purpose": "Define a custom Apache Beam PTransform for matching files with optional shuffling to improve distribution.",
  "sources": "Import statements for apache_beam and apache_beam.io.fileio; instantiation of MatchFiles class, particularly the file_pattern parameter.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data is written or transmitted outside the intended Beam pipeline.",
  "flows": "Input pipeline triggers the MatchFiles transform, which internally calls FileSystems.match and optionally reshuffles results.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be a standard wrapper around Apache Beam's file matching and reshuffle functionalities. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom PTransform that matches files based on a pattern, then optionally reshuffles the matched file names to avoid fusion issues in certain runners. It uses standard Apache Beam libraries without any suspicious or malicious logic. No external data input, no untrusted sources, and no dangerous operations detected. The implementation is straightforward and adheres to typical usage patterns for Beam.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for file matching with optional reshuffling. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. It is a standard implementation meant to improve file distribution in Apache Beam pipelines.",
