  "purpose": "Define a custom Apache Beam transformation for matching files with optional shuffling to improve runner compatibility.",
  "sources": "Imports apache_beam and apache_beam.io.fileio; reads input via the expand method from the pipeline.",
  "sinks": "Uses apache_beam.io.filesystems.match via beam_fio.MatchFiles, which could potentially access file systems; the reshuffle step involves data re-distribution.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through the expand method, applying the match transformation, with optional reshuffling for distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are evident. The reshuffle is a standard pattern for distribution, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Beam PTransform for matching files based on a pattern, with an option to reshuffle matches. No external inputs (e.g., user data, environment variables) are read. The core function relies on standard Beam IO methods. The reshuffle step is used for distribution purposes, common in Beam pipelines. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected, and the code appears to implement a legitimate data processing pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a file-matching transformation with optional reshuffling for distribution. No malicious intent or security risks are identified.",
