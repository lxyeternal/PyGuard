  "purpose": "Define a custom Apache Beam transform to match files based on a pattern, with optional shuffling to break fusion.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class constructor parameters, and method calls (beam.io.filesystems.FileSystems.match and beam.Reshuffle).",
  "sinks": "None detected. No output or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (pipeline) -> MatchFiles.expand() -> File matching (FileSystems.match) -> Optional reshuffle (beam.Reshuffle) -> Output pipeline.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code performs standard file matching and reshuffling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom Beam PTransform for matching files using a pattern, with an option to reshuffle results to improve distribution. It uses standard Apache Beam IO modules and does not execute any external commands, process untrusted input, or include obfuscated code. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic are present. The primary operation is file matching with optional shuffling, which is common for distributed data processing tasks. The code appears to be a legitimate extension of Beam functionality aimed at improving runner compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured custom Apache Beam transform designed for file pattern matching with optional shuffling. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility module.",
