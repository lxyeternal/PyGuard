{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up a module with specific exports and checks for the presence of the 'apache_beam' dependency, likely for data processing tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements and the __all__ variable declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing a dependency and defining module exports, with no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a straightforward import check and defines exports without any suspicious logic, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script verifies the presence of the 'apache_beam' module, raising an error if not found, and defines a list of module components for export. It includes licensing information and standard Python module setup code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. The code is simple, clean, and aligned with typical open-source module patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, primarily performing dependency verification and defining module exports. No malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
