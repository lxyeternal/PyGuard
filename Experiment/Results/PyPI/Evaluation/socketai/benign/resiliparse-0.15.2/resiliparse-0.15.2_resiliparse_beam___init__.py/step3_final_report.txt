  "purpose": "Dependency validation and module export setup for open-source Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'apache_beam' with exception handling.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks, only dependency check and module declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import check and __all__ declaration, no obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard dependency check for 'apache_beam' and defines __all__ for module exports. It includes license comments and simple exception handling. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is present. The code is purely declarative, with no data processing or external data flows. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. Confidence levels are high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or security concerns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard dependency validation snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
