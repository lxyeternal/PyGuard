{
  "purpose": "This code imports the apache_beam library and defines an exported list of modules or identifiers for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statement for 'apache_beam' and the __all__ list initialization.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling points in this code segment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code only performs a conditional import and defines a list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The import and list definition are standard. The code is mostly configuration/initialization with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with license comments, then attempts to import 'apache_beam', raising an error if the module is not present. It then defines '__all__' with several string identifiers. There are no dynamic code executions, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious behaviors. The import failure handling is straightforward. Overall, the code is simple and intended for defining module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as part of a package initialization or export configuration. No malicious activity, suspicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
