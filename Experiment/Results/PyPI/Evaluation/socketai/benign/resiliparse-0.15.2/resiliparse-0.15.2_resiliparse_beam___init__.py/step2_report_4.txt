  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a minimal dependency check and module export setup. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard dependency check and export setup. No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign; scores are justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—dependency import, __all__ definition, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk score (0.1), possibly due to the confidence that the code is benign but acknowledging the minimal security concern of dependency checks. Still, no malicious activity is present.\n- **Recommendation:** The securityRisk score could be kept at 0 or slightly above, but 0.1 is acceptable given the context.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard setup code, no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The code is benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern, dependency check, export list, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely dependency validation and module export setup.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected or claimed.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the simplicity and benign nature, a risk score of 0 or very close to 0 is appropriate. The third report's 0.1 is acceptable but could be slightly lowered.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0 for all, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Set to 0 for all reports, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review, confirming that the code is a standard dependency check and module export setup with no malicious intent or security risks.",
