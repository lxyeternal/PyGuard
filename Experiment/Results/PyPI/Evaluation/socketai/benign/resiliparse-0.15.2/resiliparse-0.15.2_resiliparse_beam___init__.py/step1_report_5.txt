{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a package's initialization or module setup, primarily listing dependencies and setting module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'apache_beam' and the module's own static list '__all__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative and import-based.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. The import error handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the presence of the 'apache_beam' module and raises an error if missing, which is typical dependency management. The '__all__' list defines the public interface. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity is detected. There is no obfuscation, encryption, or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with dependency verification and export declaration, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
