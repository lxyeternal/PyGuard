{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module metadata and import the apache_beam library, likely for a data processing or pipeline-related project.",
  "sources": "The import statement for apache_beam, which reads the library at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink that processes untrusted data or leads to potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "The source (import apache_beam) flows into the module's setup, with no further data processing or data flow mechanisms present.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a simple import with a runtime check and defines __all__ for exports. No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code's main function is to ensure the presence of the apache_beam dependency and to define a list of exported module components. The import check raises an error if apache_beam is missing, which is a standard dependency validation pattern. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no hidden code, and no suspicious logic. The code is minimal, well-structured, and typical for Python module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, performing dependency validation and module export setup without any malicious intent or security risks.",
