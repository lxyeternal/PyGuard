  "purpose": "Metadata definition for a Python package named 'metaphone', providing package information such as name, version, author, license, URL, and description.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only static variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets other than standard metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines metadata variables for a Python package with static string assignments. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious behaviors present. The author and license information are typical for package metadata. The URL points to a GitHub repository which appears legitimate. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package metadata declaration with no malicious or security concerns. It appears to be standard and safe.",
