  "purpose": "Static package metadata declaration for the 'metaphone' Python library, including name, version, author, license, URL, and description.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static string variables: display_name, library_name, version, author, author_email, license, url, description.",
  "sinks": "None; no input/output, network calls, or dynamic data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and contains only metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata with no dynamic or malicious code, obfuscation, or external data interactions. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malware or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, harmless nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static package metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
