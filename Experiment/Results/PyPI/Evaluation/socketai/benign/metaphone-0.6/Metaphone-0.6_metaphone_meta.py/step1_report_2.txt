  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of variable assignments for package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns string literals to variables representing package information such as name, version, author, email, license, URL, and description. No code execution, input/output, or data handling is present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks in this static metadata definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package metadata declaration with no malicious or suspicious activity. It is standard and safe.",
