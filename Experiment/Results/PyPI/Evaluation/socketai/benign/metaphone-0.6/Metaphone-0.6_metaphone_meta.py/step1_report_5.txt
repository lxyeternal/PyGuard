{
  "purpose": "Defines metadata for the 'metaphone' Python package, including name, version, author info, license, URL, and description.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of string literals; no input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static data only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials beyond author contact, which is typical for package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns package metadata variables with static string values. There are no input operations, external calls, or dynamic code execution. All data is hardcoded. No malicious behavior or anomalies are detected. The code is standard for package setup or metadata definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code only contains package metadata definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical for a Python package manifest.",
