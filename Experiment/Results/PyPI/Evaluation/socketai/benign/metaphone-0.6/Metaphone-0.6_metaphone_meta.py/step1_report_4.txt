  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'metaphone' Python library, including name, version, author, license, URL, and description.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments for display_name, library_name, version, author, author_email, license, url, description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows or untrusted input sources.",
  "flows": "None; the code is straightforward variable assignment with static strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials used in a suspicious context, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external network calls, and no potential data leaks. The author information, URL, and license are publicly available and typical for package metadata. No malicious behavior or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as metadata definition for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
