  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable due to absence of input and output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet is empty, which is unusual. Lack of code may suggest incomplete or obfuscated content; no suspicious behavior is observable.",
  "analysis": "The review is limited by the absence of actual code. Without code, no sources, sinks, or flows can be established. The empty code fragment does not demonstrate malicious activity or security issues. It is possible that the snippet was unintentionally empty or intentionally stripped, but no malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided empty code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The absence of code prevents further detailed analysis.",
