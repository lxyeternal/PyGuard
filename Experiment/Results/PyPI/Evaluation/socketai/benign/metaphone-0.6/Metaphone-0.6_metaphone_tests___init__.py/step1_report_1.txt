  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but without additional context or comments, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'input()' function and potentially from environment variables or external files if present, but no explicit data sources are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, file operations, or network calls if present, but none are explicitly shown in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input or environment variables to internal variables, then possibly to output or external calls if present, but the specific flow cannot be fully determined due to limited code visibility.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code's logic is simple and standard, involving reading inputs, processing data, and outputting results. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious operations. The lack of external network connections, encrypted code, or hidden behavior suggests no malicious intent. Without additional context or hidden code segments, the risk level remains low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with standard data handling operations.",
