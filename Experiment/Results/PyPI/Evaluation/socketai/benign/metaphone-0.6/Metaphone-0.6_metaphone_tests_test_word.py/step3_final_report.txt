  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Word class in metaphone.word module, verifying string processing, Unicode handling, and language features.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string inputs within test cases, including Unicode characters.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input handling, no data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed within class methods; no external flows or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of controlled unit tests for string processing functions, with no network, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. Unicode handling appears correct, and no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified based on the code's content and behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
