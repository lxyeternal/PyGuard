  "purpose": "Import functions 'doublemetaphone' and 'dm' from a local module named 'metaphone'.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data or untrusted input processing shown.",
  "flows": "N/A; only an import statement with no data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; simple import statement. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a local module called 'metaphone'. This is a standard Python import statement. No untrusted data sources, no data sinks, and no complex logic or malicious indicators are present. The module's purpose seems to be phonetic encoding or similar based on function names, which is benign. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues are evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified. It appears to be part of a larger module or package focused on phonetic processing.",
