  "purpose": "The code imports functions 'doublemetaphone' and 'dm' from a local module named 'metaphone'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; only imports from a local module.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code only establishes an import, no data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import; no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement pulling functions from a local module. There are no inputs, external network calls, or data manipulations. The functions imported are presumably related to phonetic algorithms, which is common in text processing. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
