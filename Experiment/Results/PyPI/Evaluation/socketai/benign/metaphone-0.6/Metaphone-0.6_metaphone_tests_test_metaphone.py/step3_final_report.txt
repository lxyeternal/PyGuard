{
  "purpose": "This code is a set of unit tests verifying the correctness of the doublemetaphone phonetic encoding function with various inputs.",
  "sources": "Static input strings within test cases",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or file operations",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed directly to the doublemetaphone function; no external data flows are present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains straightforward test cases with no suspicious or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python unittest suite testing the doublemetaphone function with static, controlled inputs. It involves no external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities. The tests serve solely to validate phonetic encoding correctness across multiple languages and edge cases.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely for testing purposes, and contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
