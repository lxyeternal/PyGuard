  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script importing metadata from an external module and reading README for long description.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'setuptools' and 'metaphone.meta'; reading 'README.rst' file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable misuse detected.",
  "flows": "Importing metadata from 'metaphone.meta' as source; no data flows leading to potential vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external 'meta' attributes; reading a README file; no suspicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script that imports package metadata from an external module and reads a README file. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The reliance on 'metaphone.meta' is typical for package metadata and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external dependency reliance, which is standard practice. All signals point to benign, well-structured code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor reliance on external metadata does not constitute a security risk. Overall, the package is safe for use.",
