  "purpose": "String normalization and pattern detection utility for linguistic processing.",
  "sources": "Input string data (bytes or unicode), internal buffer for substring extraction.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data output, network calls, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input data is decoded, characters replaced, normalized, and stored in buffer; methods access internal buffer segments.",
  "anomalies": "Replacement of specific byte sequences (\\xc7, \\xe7) with 's' is unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard string processing: decoding bytes, replacing specific characters, Unicode normalization, and substring extraction. No external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. The character replacements are likely linguistic normalization steps. The pattern matching in 'is_slavo_germanic' is straightforward. No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The code's structure is clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign string normalization utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
