  "purpose": "This code defines a Word class for processing and normalizing input strings, primarily for linguistic or phonetic analysis.",
  "sources": "The input parameter to the __init__ method, which can be bytes or a string.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks for untrusted data leading to potential data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Input data is decoded if bytes, then normalized, and stored in various attributes. No external or untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code replaces specific byte sequences with 's', which might be unusual but does not appear malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code processes input data by decoding (if bytes), replacing certain characters, and normalizing Unicode characters. It defines a property for language detection and a method for substring extraction, all of which are benign operations. There is no network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious code execution. The overall structure is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for string normalization and processing with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
