{
  "purpose": "The code provides tools for analyzing TensorFlow graphs to determine tensor readiness, dependencies, and paths, primarily for use in data transformation workflows involving tf.Transform.",
  "sources": "Collection of graph nodes such as 'TABLE_INITIALIZERS', input tensors, and function graph attributes, which are read during dependency analysis.",
  "sinks": "Operations, tensors, and collection items that serve as endpoints for dependency tracking, such as tensor outputs and initializable tables.",
  "flows": "Dependency traversal from sources (inputs, placeholders, initializable tables) through graph nodes to sinks (outputs, initializers), including path hashing and source identification.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code strictly performs dependency analysis and path hashing using standard TensorFlow APIs.",
  "analysis": "The code analyzes TensorFlow graphs for tensor readiness, dependencies, and path uniqueness. It inspects collections, attributes, and function graphs, raising exceptions for unexpected placeholders or tables. It uses hashing to generate unique identifiers for paths, and traverses the graph to determine which tensors are ready to execute. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious modifications are present. The logic is consistent with standard graph analysis utilities, with proper exception handling and dependency resolution. The code is complex but transparent, relying solely on TensorFlow internals and collections.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate TensorFlow graph dependency and readiness analysis utility. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are accurate and justified.",
