  "purpose": "Utility functions for TensorFlow 2.x, including tensor manipulation, input provisioning, and graph analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from TensorFlow and tensorflow_transform; function parameters that accept external data like `force_tf_compat_v1`, `flat_tensor_list`, `structured_inputs`, and `func_graph`.",
  "sinks": "Tensor creation and manipulation functions such as `tf.zeros`, `tf.raw_ops.PlaceholderWithDefault`, and `tf.SparseTensor` constructions; use of `tf.raw_ops.PlaceholderWithDefault` which can accept externally provided default values.",
  "flows": "External inputs (e.g., `force_tf_compat_v1`, `structured_inputs`, `func_graph`) influence tensor creation and graph construction through parameter passing; tensor outputs like placeholders and tensors depend on these inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Use of `tf.raw_ops.PlaceholderWithDefault` may be sensitive if supplied with malicious defaults, but this is a common pattern for default tensor placeholders. No obfuscated code features detected. No network communication, reverse shells, or data exfiltration mechanisms present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for TensorFlow graph manipulation and tensor provisioning, such as stripping control dependencies, supplying missing tensors, and extracting structured inputs from function graphs. It leverages TensorFlow's APIs for tensor and graph operations without including any suspicious or malicious patterns. The use of placeholders with default values is typical for handling missing data during graph execution and does not inherently pose security risks. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious data handling. All functions serve legitimate purposes related to TensorFlow graph and tensor management, with no indication of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard utility library for TensorFlow 2.x graph and tensor handling. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The use of placeholders and tensor operations aligns with normal TensorFlow development practices. The code is well-structured and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
