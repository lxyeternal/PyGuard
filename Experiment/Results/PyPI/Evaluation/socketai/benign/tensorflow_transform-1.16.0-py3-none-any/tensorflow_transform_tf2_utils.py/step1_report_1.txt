  "purpose": "Utility functions for TensorFlow 2.x operations, including handling tensors, control dependencies, and functional graph inputs.",
  "sources": "Code reads tensor inputs, function graph inputs, and environment variables related to TensorFlow execution modes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data leak points identified. The code mainly manipulates tensors and graph structures internally.",
  "flows": "Flow involves reading tensors, controlling dependencies, and constructing placeholders or tensors based on input shapes. No external data flow or network communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. Functions perform standard TensorFlow operations with no hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for TensorFlow graph manipulations and tensor handling, such as stripping control dependencies, supplying missing tensors, and extracting inputs from function graphs. All functions perform straightforward tensor operations, placeholder creation, and graph input extraction without any external or malicious actions. No suspicious logic, network activity, or privacy violations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions intended for TensorFlow 2.x workflows. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply handles tensor and graph input processing in a typical manner.",
