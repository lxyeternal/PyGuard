  "purpose": "Utility functions for TensorFlow 2.x to handle control dependencies, tensor shape inference, input placeholders, and graph input extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments (e.g., 'flat_tensor_list', 'structured_inputs'), and TensorFlow operations fetching tensor shapes, types, and graph inputs.",
  "sinks": "Creates tensors and placeholders, manipulates tensor shapes, and constructs SparseTensor and RaggedTensor objects; no direct data leaks or untrusted data effects observed.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through shape inference and placeholder creation, with data flow confined within TensorFlow graph construction. No external data flows or network communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Functions perform standard TensorFlow utility operations. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious control flows are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for TensorFlow graph management, including control dependency stripping, tensor shape supply, missing input supply, and extraction of graph inputs. It uses standard TensorFlow APIs, handles various tensor types securely, and does not include any external network calls or hidden behaviors. The code appears to be clean, purpose-specific, and free of suspicious patterns. No anomalies or malicious intents are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate utility module for TensorFlow graph manipulation, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard implementation supporting TF2 workflows.",
