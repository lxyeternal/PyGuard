{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for TensorFlow 2, including handling tensors, control dependencies, and graph inputs, primarily for use within TensorFlow transformations and models.",
  "sources": "Input tensors from tf.function outputs, structured input signatures from FuncGraph objects, environment variables (via tf2.enabled()), and structured input mappings.",
  "sinks": "Tensor creation with tf.zeros, tf.raw_ops.PlaceholderWithDefault, and construction of tf.SparseTensor and tf.RaggedTensor objects. Also, potential access to environment variables and internal TensorFlow functions.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are processed to remove control dependencies and create missing tensors or placeholders, which can be fed into computational graphs. Structured inputs are extracted from FuncGraph objects for model inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of internal TensorFlow functions and placeholders is standard for model input handling. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected. The code mainly handles tensor manipulation and input supply, which is typical for TensorFlow utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code implements typical TensorFlow utility functions for managing tensors, control dependencies, and graph inputs. It includes functions to remove control dependencies from tensors, generate placeholder tensors with default values, supply missing input tensors based on shapes and dtypes, and extract structured inputs from a FuncGraph. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The code relies on standard TensorFlow APIs and functions, and no suspicious or unexpected behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard TensorFlow utility functions used for model input handling and tensor manipulation. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are identified. It is consistent with normal TensorFlow usage in machine learning pipelines.",
