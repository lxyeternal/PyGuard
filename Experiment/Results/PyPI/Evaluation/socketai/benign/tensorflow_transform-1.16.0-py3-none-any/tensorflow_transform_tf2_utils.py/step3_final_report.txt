{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for TensorFlow 2.x, including tensor handling, control dependency management, and graph input extraction.",
  "sources": "TensorFlow functions such as tf.Tensor, tf.Operation, tf.raw_ops.PlaceholderWithDefault, and tf.shape, which read tensor shapes, types, and graph inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks, network activity, or malicious actions are present; functions are standard tensor and graph utilities.",
  "flows": "Data flows from tensor inputs and shapes through utility functions to produce placeholders, tensor lists, or extract graph inputs, with no suspicious data exfiltration or control flow manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of tf.raw_ops.PlaceholderWithDefault is standard but could be misused if defaults are malicious; however, in this context, it is typical for handling missing inputs. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard TensorFlow utility functions for tensor shape handling, control dependency stripping, input supply, and graph input extraction. No malicious logic, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The functions use common TensorFlow APIs and patterns for graph and tensor management. The use of placeholders with defaults is a common pattern and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is well-structured, straightforward, and aligns with typical TensorFlow utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard TensorFlow utility module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
