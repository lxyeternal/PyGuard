{
  "purpose": "The code provides statistical functions related to the Tukey HH distribution, including moment calculations, parameter estimation, inverse transformations, and the Lambert W function, primarily for distribution analysis and parameter fitting.",
  "sources": "Function arguments, numpy arrays, and tensorflow tensors used as inputs for statistical computations.",
  "sinks": "Internal mathematical computations; no external data transmission, network activity, or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through mathematical functions (moment calculations, binary search, Lambert W) within the module; no external data or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard statistical routines for the Tukey HH distribution, including moment calculations, skewness, kurtosis, parameter estimation via binary search, Lambert W function via Newton-Raphson, and inverse transformations. It relies solely on numpy and tensorflow, with no network activity or external data leaks. The functions perform legitimate mathematical operations, and no obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The numerical methods used are typical for such computations, and the code structure is clear and well-documented. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured statistical utility library for the Tukey HH distribution, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the overall assessment indicates a safe supply chain inclusion.",
