{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for statistical analysis of the Tukey HH distribution, including parameter computation, moments calculation, and inverse transformations, primarily for use in data modeling or statistical simulations.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function arguments such as h_params, h, delta_h, l_skewness_and_kurtosis, and x; these include numpy arrays, tensor inputs, and scalar values.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe sinks include tf.math.log and tf.where functions which handle untrusted input data; these could be misused if inputs are maliciously crafted, but no direct data leaks or malicious network activity are observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through mathematical computations, numpy/tensorflow functions, and binary search routines to produce distribution parameters, moments, and inverse transformations; no external or network data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code uses standard mathematical functions and well-known statistical methods. The Lambert W implementation employs iterative Newton updates with fixed iteration count, typical for numerical methods.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of statistical distribution parameter estimation and transformation functions. It leverages numpy for numerical calculations and tensorflow for differentiable operations. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious code is found. The functions perform calculations based on input parameters and mathematical formulas with no external side-effects or hidden data exfiltration mechanisms. The use of tf.where, numpy, and scipy-like functions is consistent with legitimate mathematical modeling tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate statistical utility library for distribution parameter estimation and inverse transformations. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. Its complexity is typical for mathematical/statistical code, and there are no indicators of malicious intent.",
