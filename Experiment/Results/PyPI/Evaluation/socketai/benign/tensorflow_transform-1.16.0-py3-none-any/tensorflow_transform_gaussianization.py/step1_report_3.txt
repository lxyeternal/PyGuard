{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for statistical analysis of the Tukey HH distribution, including parameter computation, inverse transformations, and the Lambert W function, primarily for use in data transformation or modeling tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters such as h_params, h, delta_h, l_skewness_and_kurtosis, and x (in inverse_tukey_hh). Also reads from numpy, tensorflow, and mathematical constants.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs include the results of computations like _tukey_hh_l_mean_and_scale, _tukey_hh_l_skewness_and_kurtosis, compute_tukey_hh_params, lambert_w, and inverse_tukey_hh. No untrusted external communication or data leakage points are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into mathematical functions that compute statistical moments and inverse transformations. Data from inputs like h_params or l_skewness_and_kurtosis are processed internally with no external side-effects or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names. Functions appear to perform legitimate mathematical calculations relevant to distribution parameterization. No suspicious side-effects, such as network access or file manipulation, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains functions for statistical calculations (L-moments, skewness, kurtosis), a Lambert W function implementation via Newton-Raphson iterations, and inverse Tukey HH transformations. The implementation relies on numpy for mathematical operations and TensorFlow for tensor computations, with clear documentation. The flow is strictly mathematical, with no external communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The functions focus on legitimate statistical transformations, with proper control flows and no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate statistical utility library for distribution parameter estimation and transformation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attacks. The functions serve their purpose in modeling and data analysis without side-effects or malicious operations.",
