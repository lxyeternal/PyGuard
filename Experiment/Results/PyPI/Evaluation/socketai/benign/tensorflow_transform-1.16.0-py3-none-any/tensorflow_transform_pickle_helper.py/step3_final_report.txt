  "purpose": "Provides functions to fix pickling issues for protobuf and TensorFlow objects by registering custom serialization routines.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions and object instances during registration, and uses methods like SerializeToString() for serialization.",
  "sinks": "The functions serialize objects to strings and deserialize them back, used internally during pickling/unpickling processes.",
  "flows": "Registration of custom pickling functions occurs at module load; serialization functions are invoked during pickling, deserialization during unpickling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and standard for internal serialization support.",
  "analysis": "The code registers custom pickling routines for protobuf and TensorFlow objects to address pickling issues. It uses standard APIs and conditional imports, with no external data processing or network activity. The functions serialize objects with SerializeToString() and reconstruct with FromString(), which are standard protobuf methods. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The purpose is purely to support serialization in workflows, with minimal security implications. The code does not process untrusted input directly, and the registration is an internal mechanism. Therefore, the code is benign, safe, and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign utility for fixing pickling issues with protobuf and TensorFlow objects. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The risk is minimal, primarily related to potential misuse if untrusted data is fed into the serialization routines outside of this code, but that is outside its scope. Overall, the code is safe, standard, and non-malicious.",
