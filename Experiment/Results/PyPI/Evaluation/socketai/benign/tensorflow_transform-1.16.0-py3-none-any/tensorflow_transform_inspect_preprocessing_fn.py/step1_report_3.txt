  "purpose": "Utilities for inspecting users' preprocessing functions in TensorFlow Transform, focusing on extracting input columns for analyze and transform operations.",
  "sources": "Reads function arguments (preprocessing_fn, specs), imports from tensorflow_transform, and calls to internal trace and graph utility functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses internal graph analysis functions to identify tensor dependencies and traverses the computation graph; no data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input functions are traced to produce computation graphs; dependent input tensors are extracted through internal utilities, with no untrusted data handling or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. All operations appear to be standard TensorFlow graph analysis routines.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to analyze TensorFlow preprocessing functions, tracing computation graphs to identify required input columns for analyze and transform steps. It leverages internal TensorFlow Transform utilities for graph tracing and dependency analysis, ensuring correct input extraction for ML pipelines. No external network activity, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are observed. The code relies entirely on TensorFlow's internal APIs, which are standard for this domain.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for graph analysis in TensorFlow Transform. It performs no malicious actions or suspicious behaviors, focusing solely on extracting input dependencies for data preprocessing functions. No signs of malware or security risks are detected.",
