  "purpose": "Utilities for inspecting users' preprocessing functions in TensorFlow Transform, specifically for analyzing input features required for dataset analysis and transformation.",
  "sources": "Function arguments (`preprocessing_fn`, `specs`, `force_tf_compat_v1`) which accept user-defined functions, specifications, and flags. Internal calls to `trace_preprocessing_function`, `graph.get_collection`, and `tf2_utils.strip_and_get_tensors_and_control_dependencies` which process graph and tensor data.",
  "sinks": "Access to internal graph collections (`analyzer_nodes.TENSOR_REPLACEMENTS`), tensor dependencies, and control dependencies which could potentially expose or manipulate internal tensors or control flows.",
  "flows": "Input functions and specifications flow into `trace_preprocessing_function` to produce graph and tensor data. Collected tensor sinks are traversed to identify source tensors. Dependent inputs are then extracted from the graph for analysis and transformation input columns.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors observed. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. The code relies on standard TensorFlow and tensorflow_transform APIs without unusual dynamic code execution or external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for inspecting the required input columns for dataset analysis and transformation in TensorFlow Transform. It performs graph tracing of user-defined preprocessing functions, collects relevant tensors and control dependencies, and identifies input features involved in analysis and transformation. The use of internal TensorFlow APIs and graph traversal methods appears standard and safe. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code operates solely within TensorFlow's graph and metadata structures, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard utility for inspecting TensorFlow Transform preprocessing functions. It uses common APIs to analyze input dependencies and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
