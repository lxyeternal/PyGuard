  "purpose": "Utility functions for inspecting and extracting input columns for TensorFlow data preprocessing functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters `preprocessing_fn` and `specs`, which are used to trace the preprocessing function and extract graph dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or output points suggest potential data exfiltration or malicious data handling; code primarily deals with graph analysis and tensor dependencies.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to trace the preprocessing function, generate a graph, and extract dependent input tensors, which are then returned as required columns.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behaviors observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Code adheres to standard TensorFlow analysis patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports TensorFlow and related modules to analyze a user-defined preprocessing function. It traces the function to identify input columns required for analysis and transformation, handling both TF1 and TF2 modes. It relies on standard library calls and TensorFlow graph traversal methods without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or secret handling. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Functionality is limited to graph dependency analysis for preprocessing pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for analyzing TensorFlow preprocessing functions to extract required input columns. It performs standard graph traversal and dependency analysis without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
