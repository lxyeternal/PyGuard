  "purpose": "Utilities for inspecting users' preprocessing functions in TensorFlow Transform, specifically to identify input columns required for analysis and transformation by tracing graph dependencies and tensor collections.",
  "sources": "TensorFlow graph collections, structured inputs, and outputs during graph tracing and dependency analysis.",
  "sinks": "Internal tensor collections and control dependencies used for dependency analysis; no external data transfer or network activity.",
  "flows": "Tracing preprocessing functions to extract dependent input tensors and their source nodes within the graph.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal TensorFlow graph collections and dependency analysis APIs; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static graph analysis to identify input columns needed for dataset analysis and transformation. It uses standard TensorFlow and tensorflow_transform APIs for graph tracing, tensor collection, and dependency resolution. No data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious code is present. The code is purpose-specific, well-structured, and relies on internal APIs for graph introspection. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected. The minimal security risk score (0.1) in one report is justified by internal API use but does not indicate actual risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for graph dependency analysis in TensorFlow Transform pipelines. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
