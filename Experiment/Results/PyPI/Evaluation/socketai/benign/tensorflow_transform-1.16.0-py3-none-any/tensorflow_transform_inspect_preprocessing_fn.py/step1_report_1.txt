{
  "purpose": "Utilities for inspecting user-defined preprocessing functions in TensorFlow Transform, specifically identifying input columns required for analysis and transformation.",
  "sources": "Input functions `preprocessing_fn`, `specs` parameter providing feature specifications, internal calls to `trace_preprocessing_function` and tensor collection retrieval.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the code only inspects and traces TensorFlow graphs and tensors without external data transfer or modification.",
  "flows": "Input `preprocessing_fn` and `specs` flow through `trace_preprocessing_function` to generate graph and tensor info, then flow to tensor collection and input dependency extraction functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code primarily performs graph analysis and tensor dependency extraction.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions to analyze TensorFlow Transform preprocessing functions. It traces the graph to identify required input columns for analysis (`get_analyze_input_columns`) and transformation (`get_transform_input_columns`). The functions utilize internal TensorFlow and TensorFlow Transform APIs for graph traversal and dependency resolution. There are no external data leaks, network calls, or malicious modifications; the code is standard for graph analysis tasks. It conditionally handles TF2 and TF1 modes, ensuring proper tensor dependency extraction. The code appears to be well-structured, purpose-specific, and does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate utility code used for graph analysis within TensorFlow Transform. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code's purpose is to analyze tensor dependencies in preprocessing functions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
