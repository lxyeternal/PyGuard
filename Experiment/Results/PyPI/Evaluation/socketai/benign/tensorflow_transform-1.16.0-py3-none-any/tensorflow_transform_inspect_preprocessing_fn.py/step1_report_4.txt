  "purpose": "Utilities for inspecting and analyzing user-defined preprocessing functions in TensorFlow Transform, specifically identifying required input columns for analyze and transform steps.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: `preprocessing_fn`, `specs`, `force_tf_compat_v1`; Internal function calls to `impl_helper.trace_preprocessing_function`, `graph_tools.get_dependent_inputs`, and `tf2_utils.use_tf_compat_v1`.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data or external outputs; the code primarily inspects and traces TensorFlow graph structures without executing or transmitting data externally.",
  "flows": "Inputs (`preprocessing_fn`, `specs`, `force_tf_compat_v1`) -> internal graph tracing functions -> collection of tensor nodes -> determination of dependent input columns for analyze and transform datasets.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious external calls; standard usage of TensorFlow APIs for graph analysis. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious control flows.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static analysis of TensorFlow preprocessing functions to determine required input features for analysis and transformation steps. It leverages internal libraries to trace computational graphs and identify dependencies. No data is transmitted externally, and no security-sensitive operations such as code execution, network communication, or data leakage are present. The code follows expected patterns for such analysis utilities and does not exhibit suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for inspecting TensorFlow Transform preprocessing functions. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It only analyzes graph dependencies to determine necessary input features. Overall, it is safe and aligns with standard practices for such tools.",
