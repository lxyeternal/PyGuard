  "purpose": "Test suite for tensorflow_transform.nodes, validating node operations, traversal, and graph visualization.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, mock objects, operation parameters, internal graph creation.",
  "sinks": "Internal graph traversal and visualization; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Node creation -> graph traversal -> visualization; no untrusted data flow to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for internal graph operations, involving mock objects and validation of traversal, cycle detection, and visualization. No external data handling, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code structure and content are typical for testing frameworks, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for internal testing of tensorflow_transform.nodes. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low scores assigned in the reports are justified and appropriate.",
