  "purpose": "Unit tests for tensorflow_transform's internal schema inference, including schema annotations and protobuf handling.",
  "sources": "Input tensors, constants, protobuf encode/decode operations, function parameters, internal annotations.",
  "sinks": "Internal protobuf annotations, no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input tensors → protobuf encode (tf.raw_ops.EncodeProto) → annotations → schema inference functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard unit tests for schema inference, utilizing TensorFlow APIs, protobuf annotations, and internal functions. No external data transmission, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. Use of protobuf encode/decode is typical for schema annotations. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are observed. The code operates within controlled testing environments, focusing on schema validation and annotation extraction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate testing code for tensorflow_transform's schema inference, with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks. It employs standard practices and internal APIs without external dependencies or network activity.",
