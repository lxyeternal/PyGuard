  "review": "Let's review the reports carefully and analyze their assessments against the original code.\n\n**Summary of the Original Code:**\n- Defines three custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions.\n- Contains no runtime logic, data handling, external interactions, or obfuscation.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely definitional, with no data flows, external input/output, or suspicious constructs.\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly conclude that the code is benign and solely for error handling.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n### Scores and their appropriateness:\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n  - Confidence: 1\n- These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n### Risk and malware justification:\n- Since there is no malicious activity, malware score remains at 0.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present, so obfuscated score remains at 0.\n- Security risk is correctly scored at 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n- The reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions solely on the code's static analysis.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are made, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent.** They correctly identify the code as benign, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\nGiven the detailed analysis, I agree with the reports' assessments. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's actual content and the comprehensive review provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a straightforward, safe, and standard pattern for defining custom exceptions. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present. The reports' conclusions are justified and accurate.",
