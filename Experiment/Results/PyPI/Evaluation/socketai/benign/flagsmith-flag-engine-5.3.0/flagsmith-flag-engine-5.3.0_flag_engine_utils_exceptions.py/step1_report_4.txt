  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to feature states and percentage allocations.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; class definitions for exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing operations present; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as this is only class definition code.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard exception class definitions with no unusual or suspicious features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exceptions inheriting from built-in exception classes, likely used for error handling in a larger application. There are no functions, external data reads, or untrusted inputs. No obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior patterns are present. The structure and content are straightforward and common in Python applications.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to be a standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
