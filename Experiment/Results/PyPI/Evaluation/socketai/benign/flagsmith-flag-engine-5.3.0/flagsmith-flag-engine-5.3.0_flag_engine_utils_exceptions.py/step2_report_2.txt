  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Actual Issues:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only defines three custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions.\n   - There are no data flows, external data handling, or runtime logic.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n   - The code appears benign and purely structural, intended for use elsewhere in an application.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly state that there are no security issues or malicious behaviors.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The assessments are appropriate given the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores Given and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are reasonable, as the code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious features.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The reports uniformly assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - No risk scores need to be increased; the code does not pose any security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - Since no malicious activity or indicators are present, malware score remains at 0.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions or Claims:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n   - No further skepticism is necessary.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The assessments are uniform and appropriate.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall,** the code is a simple, benign set of exception class definitions with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and well-founded.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is purely structural, with no malicious or security-sensitive elements.",
