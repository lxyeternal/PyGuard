  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**:\n   - The original code only defines three custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exception types.\n   - There are no data flows, data input/output, external interactions, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - Based on the code, the claims in each report that it is benign and solely for error handling are accurate.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is simple class definitions with no malicious or security-sensitive logic.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which seems justified given the straightforward analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores**:\n   - The `malware` score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The `securityRisk` score is also 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:\n   - The code does not handle data, perform network operations, or execute any logic that could be exploited.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are justified here; the code is purely class definitions.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency and Final Assessment**:\n   - All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n   - The detailed reasoning confirms the absence of security issues or malicious behavior.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0.1 (a minimal risk score to account for the fact that these classes could be misused in a larger context, but as-is, no risk exists)\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is safe and not malicious. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no further action is required.",
