  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for feature state management errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or untrusted data handling; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; code consists solely of class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious or unusual code; only standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exception types. There are no input handling, data processing, or external communications. The classes are straightforward and serve as error indicators within a larger system. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger project for handling feature state errors. No malware or security risks are identified.",
