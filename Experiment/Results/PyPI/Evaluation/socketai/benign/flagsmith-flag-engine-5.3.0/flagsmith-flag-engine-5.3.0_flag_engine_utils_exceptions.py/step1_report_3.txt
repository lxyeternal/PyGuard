{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling related to feature states and percentage allocation.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs, especially no untrusted data handling or sensitive data exposure.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions with no suspicious or unusual behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions. There is no logic, input handling, or data processing. No malicious patterns such as network activity, data leaks, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be part of a larger application for handling feature state errors. No security issues or malicious intent are identifiable in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign set of exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
