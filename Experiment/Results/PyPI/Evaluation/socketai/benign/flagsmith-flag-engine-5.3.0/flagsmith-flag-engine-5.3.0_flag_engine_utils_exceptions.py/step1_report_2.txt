{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for feature state management and validation errors.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no unusual patterns or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three custom exception class definitions inheriting from standard Python exception types. It contains no logic, data processing, or external interactions. There are no suspicious functions, no external data handling, and no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The code appears to be part of a larger project focused on feature state management, with no evident security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, only defining custom exception classes without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risks.",
