  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions; no data input/output or external data handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process external input.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; purely class definitions with no execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class inheritance without obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three custom exception class definitions inheriting from standard Python exceptions. There are no data flows, external interactions, or runtime logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is purely structural, intended for use elsewhere in an application. The assessments in the reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or contain suspicious patterns. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports' evaluations are accurate and appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
