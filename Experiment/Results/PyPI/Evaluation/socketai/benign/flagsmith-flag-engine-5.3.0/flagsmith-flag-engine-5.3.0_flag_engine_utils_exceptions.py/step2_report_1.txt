  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from built-in exception types.\n   - No data input/output, data processing, external interactions, or runtime logic is present.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n   - The code appears to be straightforward, intended for use elsewhere in a larger application.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. This is accurate given the code snippet.\n   - The reports do not miss any security concerns or potential vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - The detailed reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, indicating certainty in their benign assessment.\n   - These scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions with no runtime behavior, no data handling, and no external interactions, a high risk score is unwarranted.\n   - The reports' risk scores of 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions and stick to observable facts.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign and not suspicious.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward, benign set of exception class definitions used for error handling in a larger application. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always review code in the context of the entire application, but based solely on this snippet, the security assessment is that it is safe.",
