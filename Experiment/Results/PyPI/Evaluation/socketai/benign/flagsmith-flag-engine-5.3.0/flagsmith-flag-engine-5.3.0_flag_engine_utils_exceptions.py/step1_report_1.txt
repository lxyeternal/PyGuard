{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for feature state management and validation errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, as the code only defines classes and exceptions without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions inheriting from built-in exception types. There are no dynamic behaviors, data handling, or external interactions. The purpose appears to be for application-specific error handling related to feature states and percentages. The code does not include any obfuscated, malicious, or security-sensitive logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and solely defines exception classes for use elsewhere in an application. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
