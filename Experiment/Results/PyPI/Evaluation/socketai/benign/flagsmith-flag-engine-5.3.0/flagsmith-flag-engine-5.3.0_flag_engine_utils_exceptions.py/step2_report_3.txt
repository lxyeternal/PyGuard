  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code only defines three custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions.\n   - There are no data flows, input/output operations, or external interactions.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign and purely for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is straightforward class definitions with no malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports and the code itself show no malicious behavior, the malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The security risk score should also be 0, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The code is purely class definitions; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified.\n   - No external data handling, no network activity, no obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - The high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores align with the benign nature.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions.\n   - No malware, obfuscation, or security issues are present.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate; the code is benign. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and security risk, with high confidence. No changes needed.",
