  "purpose": "Provides a function to obtain the current UTC time with timezone information.",
  "sources": "Uses the standard library function datetime.now() with timezone=timezone.utc.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The function directly returns the current UTC datetime object; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard datetime functions and defines a straightforward function to get the current UTC time with timezone info. It uses the built-in datetime.now() method with timezone set to UTC, which is a standard and secure way to obtain timezone-aware current time. There are no external inputs, no data manipulation, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and adheres to best practices for obtaining UTC datetime. There is no malicious intent or security risk detected.",
