  "purpose": "Function to return the current UTC datetime with timezone information",
  "sources": "Built-in functions: datetime.now() and timezone.utc",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present",
  "flows": "N/A; no untrusted data flow pathways",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard library functions",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'datetime' and 'timezone' from the standard library and defines a function that returns the current time in UTC timezone. The implementation is direct and uses standard, safe functions. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. It is a simple utility function without side effects or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign task of returning the current UTC timestamp. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
