  "purpose": "Provides current UTC datetime with timezone information.",
  "sources": "datetime.now(tz=timezone.utc) call within the function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the function only retrieves system time.",
  "flows": "Source: system clock via datetime.now() -> sink: return statement providing datetime object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, using standard library functions with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports only standard library modules and returns the current UTC time with timezone info. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard operation with no malicious intent or security issues. No external inputs, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. No anomalies or obfuscation detected. The logic is clear, and the code adheres to best practices for obtaining system time in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe utility function for retrieving the current UTC time with timezone info. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications or further analysis needed.",
