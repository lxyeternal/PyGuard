  "purpose": "Provide the current UTC datetime with timezone awareness.",
  "sources": "The function uses the standard library's datetime.now() with timezone set to UTC.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Input source is the system clock accessed via datetime.now(), which outputs the current time.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses straightforward standard library functions without unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that returns the current datetime in UTC timezone. It relies solely on the Python standard library, with no external input or data manipulation. There are no hardcoded secrets, no data leaks, and no suspicious behavior. The code is simple and does not perform any network activity or data access outside of fetching the current system time.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and has no signs of malicious intent. It securely returns the current UTC datetime with timezone awareness, typical for many applications.",
