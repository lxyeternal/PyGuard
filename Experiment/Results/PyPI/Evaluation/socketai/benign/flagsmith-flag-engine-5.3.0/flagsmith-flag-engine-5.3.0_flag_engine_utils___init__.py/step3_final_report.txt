  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code inputs, environment variables, network calls, file operations, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file write/read, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, indicating potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious network activity, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, minimal or no code, no suspicious imports or functions.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no malicious signals, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited context. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage detected. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero; security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern but acknowledging limited information. The reasoning across reports is coherent and aligns with the described code states.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed are benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or high security risks. The scoring is appropriate and consistent with the observations. Given the limited context, a cautious but low-risk profile is justified.",
