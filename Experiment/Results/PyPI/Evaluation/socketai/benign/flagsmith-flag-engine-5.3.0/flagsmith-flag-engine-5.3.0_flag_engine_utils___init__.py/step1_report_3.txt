  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility for processing data, possibly related to user input or external sources, but its specific purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet; it may read data from function parameters, environment variables, or external files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or data transmissions, but none are explicitly visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flow can be established from the available code snippet due to missing details.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are observed; code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or suspicious logic. It does not show evidence of data leaks, malicious network activity, or malicious modifications. Due to the lack of concrete data sources or sinks, a thorough source-to-sink analysis is limited.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign; however, the assessment is limited by the lack of complete context.",
