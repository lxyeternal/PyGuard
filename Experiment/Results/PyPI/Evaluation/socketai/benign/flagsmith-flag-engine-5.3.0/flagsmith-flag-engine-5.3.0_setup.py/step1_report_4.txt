{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package called 'flagsmith-flag-engine', including its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The setup script reads input from the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data; the script primarily defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' flows into the 'long_description' parameter during package setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code reads a file ('README.md') directly without sanitization, which is typical and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata, dependencies, and package data. It reads the README file to set a long description, which is normal practice. No suspicious imports, code execution, or data handling that could be malicious is detected. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated elements or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks.",
