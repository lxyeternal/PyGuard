{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'flagsmith-flag-engine'. It prepares the package metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package description from 'README.md' file using open('README.md').read().",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak data or execute malicious commands.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' flows into the 'long_description' parameter of setup(), with no other data flows or external inputs processed or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code follows standard setup.py patterns with no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration script using setuptools. It imports find_packages and setup, then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and package data. The only file operation is reading 'README.md' to include as the long description. There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling beyond reading a local file, and no suspicious or malicious patterns. The dependencies listed are standard packages with specified version ranges, and the overall structure is typical for Python package distribution scripts.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this setup script. It is a benign, standard package configuration file.",
