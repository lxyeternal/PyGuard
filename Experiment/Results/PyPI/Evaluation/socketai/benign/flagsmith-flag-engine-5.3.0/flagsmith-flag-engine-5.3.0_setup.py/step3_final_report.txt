{
  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'flagsmith-flag-engine' library.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; imports 'find_packages' and 'setup' from setuptools; specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads local file 'README.md' and passes static metadata and dependencies to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script used for packaging Python projects. It imports necessary modules, reads a local README file for description, and calls setup() with static metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no dynamic behaviors, untrusted inputs, or network activities. The code structure is simple and standard, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The dependencies are version-constrained and legitimate. No anomalies or suspicious signals are present. The code does not perform any insecure operations or contain hidden malicious code. The overall assessment is that the code is benign, with a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscated score of 0.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py script is a standard, benign package configuration file with no security concerns or malicious intent. All evidence indicates it is safe and free of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
