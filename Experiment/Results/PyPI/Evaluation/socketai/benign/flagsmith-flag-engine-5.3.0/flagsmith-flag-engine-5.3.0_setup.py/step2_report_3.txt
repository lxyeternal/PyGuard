  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a standard, benign Python setup script.\n- No suspicious behaviors, malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies are identified.\n- The only file operation is reading 'README.md' for the long description, which is standard practice.\n- Dependencies are well-defined with version constraints, and no external or untrusted data is processed.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, and no code execution or network activity is present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  **No.** The code appears to be a typical setup.py configuration script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n### Logical or Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or mistakes?**  \n  **None.** The reports correctly identify the code as standard and benign.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, justified by the lack of security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.  \n- They correctly identify that the code does not perform any suspicious actions, does not process untrusted input, and contains no malware.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Overall Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**  \n  Given the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The scores should remain at **malware: 0**, **obfuscated: 0**, and **risk: 0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis setup.py script is a standard, benign package configuration file with no security issues or malicious intent. All evidence points to a safe, well-structured package setup.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Confidence:** High, based on consistent, thorough review.",
