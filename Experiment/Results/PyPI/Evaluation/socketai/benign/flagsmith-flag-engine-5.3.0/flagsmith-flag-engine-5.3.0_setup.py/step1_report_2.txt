{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package named 'flagsmith-flag-engine' with specified dependencies, metadata, and package data, primarily for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads package configuration data, package metadata, README.md content, and dependency requirements.",
  "targets": "There are no explicit untrusted input sources or data sinks involved in this setup script.",
  "flows": "The setup function gathers package info, reads the README file, and specifies dependencies without any dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears standard and straightforward in its setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and package data. It reads the README.md file directly, which is common. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or sensitive data processing is present. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation features are evident. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate, and no hardcoded secrets are found.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup.py script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or execute untrusted code. The code is safe and standard for package distribution.",
