  "purpose": "Utility functions to check for and manipulate semantic version strings with a specific suffix",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'value' in is_semver function, and 'value' in remove_semver_suffix function",
  "sinks": "Return statements manipulating 'value', no direct sinks of untrusted data to external systems",
  "flows": "Input is checked in is_semver for suffix; if true, remove_semver_suffix trims last 7 characters of the string representation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple utility functions for string manipulation related to semantic versions. The is_semver function performs a suffix check on a string. The remove_semver_suffix function trims the last 7 characters from a string or Version object. Both functions operate on input data with no external side effects, no network access, and no suspicious behaviors. No security risks, malicious intent, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward utility code for version string handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears safe and benign.",
