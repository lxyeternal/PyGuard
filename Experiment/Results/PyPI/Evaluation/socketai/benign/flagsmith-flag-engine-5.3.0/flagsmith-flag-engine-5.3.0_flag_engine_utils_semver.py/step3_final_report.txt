  "purpose": "Utility functions to check for and remove the ':semver' suffix from version strings.",
  "sources": "Input string parameter in is_semver; input string in remove_semver_suffix.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; functions perform in-memory string operations only.",
  "flows": "Input string flows through is_semver check and potentially through remove_semver_suffix if suffix is present.",
  "anomalies": "Minor documentation inconsistency: remove_semver_suffix claims to accept semver.Version but example shows string input; no actual malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple string slicing and comparison to identify and remove a specific suffix. No external data, network calls, or dynamic code execution occurs. The import of semver is only for type annotation, not for validation or parsing. The functions are straightforward and safe. The main concern is the documentation mismatch in remove_semver_suffix's expected input type, which could cause runtime errors if misused, but does not introduce security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly assign malware and security risk scores as 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for version string handling with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor documentation inconsistency does not impact security. The assigned scores are appropriate and require no change.",
