  "purpose": "Utility functions to check and manipulate semantic version strings with a specific suffix.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'value' in is_semver() and remove_semver_suffix() functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit sinks that process untrusted data leading to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is checked for a suffix in is_semver() and then used for string slicing in remove_semver_suffix(). There are no external data flows or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code performs simple string checks and slicing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to identify if a string ends with ':semver' and to remove the last 7 characters (the suffix) from a version string. The logic is straightforward, using simple string slicing and comparison. The code imports 'semver' but does not invoke it in a malicious way; it's only used for type annotation. No input validation or external data processing present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility module for handling semantic version strings with a specific suffix. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks detected.",
