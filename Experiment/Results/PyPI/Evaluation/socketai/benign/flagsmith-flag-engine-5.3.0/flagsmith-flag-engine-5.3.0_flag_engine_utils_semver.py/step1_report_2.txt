{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to check if a string has a ':semver' suffix and to remove this suffix from version strings.",
  "sources": "Input data is taken from function parameters 'value' and 'value' (again) in remove_semver_suffix.",
  "bins": "The functions do not include any untrusted data from external sources; they operate on input parameters provided at runtime.",
  "flows": "Input string is checked for a specific suffix, and if present, the suffix is removed. No external data flows or injections are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs simple string manipulations with straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for a specific suffix ':semver' in a given string and removes it if present. It does not process untrusted data from external sources such as network or user input. The functions rely on string slicing, which is safe here. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected, nor is there evidence of obfuscation or malware. The functions appear to be utility helpers for version string handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, safe, and performs intended utility functions without malicious intent or security risks.",
