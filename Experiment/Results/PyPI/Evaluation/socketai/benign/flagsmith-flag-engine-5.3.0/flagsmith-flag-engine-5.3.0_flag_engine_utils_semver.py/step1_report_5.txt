{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to check and manipulate semantic version strings with a specific suffix.",
  "sources": "Input string 'value' in is_semver; semver.Version object in remove_semver_suffix",
  "sinks": "Return statements and string slicing operations, which do not process untrusted data beyond local manipulation",
  "flows": "Input is checked for suffix in is_semver, then processed to remove suffix in remove_semver_suffix",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected; the code performs straightforward string operations",
  "analysis": "The functions perform simple string checks and slicing for version strings with a specific suffix. There are no external inputs being sent over network, no file operations, nor any obfuscated or malicious code. The use of semver library appears legitimate. The operations are safe, and no data leakage or malicious intent is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for version string validation and manipulation. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
