{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to retrieve feature states for environments and identities within a feature flagging system.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment, identity, and segment models, as well as optional override traits.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data is written to external systems, network, or file; the functions return data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from models (environment, identity, traits, segments) through filtering and selection logic, ultimately returning feature state objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code; no unusual dynamic execution or obfuscation observed; functions mainly handle data filtering and retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data retrieval and filtering based on provided models and conditions. It uses standard Python constructs such as filters, list comprehensions, and dict updates. No signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. The models and functions appear to be part of a feature flag management system. No network operations, external data access, or unsafe code patterns are present. No obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility module for managing feature states in a feature flag system. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The functions are safe, and there is no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
