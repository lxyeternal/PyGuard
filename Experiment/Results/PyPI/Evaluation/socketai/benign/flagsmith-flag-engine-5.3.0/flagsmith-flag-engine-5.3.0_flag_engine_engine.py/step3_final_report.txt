{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve feature states for environments and identities, including filtering, segment matching, and overrides.",
  "sources": "Reads feature states from environment models, identity models, and external functions like get_identity_segments.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks, network calls, or file writes; operates solely on in-memory data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment and identity models through filtering and segment matching to produce feature state lists or specific feature states.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard feature flag management functions with straightforward filtering, segment evaluation, and override logic. It relies on external models and functions presumed safe. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. Exception handling is appropriate, and data flows are internal. The code does not execute external commands or handle untrusted input in a way that suggests security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent feature flag utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use, and the low risk score (around 0.1) is justified. External dependencies like get_identity_segments should be verified for security, but based on this code alone, there are no concerns.",
