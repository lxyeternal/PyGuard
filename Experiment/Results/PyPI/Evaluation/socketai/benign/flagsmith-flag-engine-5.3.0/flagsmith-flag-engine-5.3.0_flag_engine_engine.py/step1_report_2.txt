{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to retrieve feature states for environments and identities, likely used in a feature flag or configuration system.",
  "sources": "Reads from environment.feature_states, identity.identity_features, and external functions like get_identity_segments.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly write or output untrusted data; they primarily return internal data structures. No data is sent over the network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment and identity models through functions that filter or override feature states. No untrusted input is processed in a way that leads to code execution or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present. The code structure is straightforward and consistent with typical feature flag logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs feature flag lookups, filtering, and overriding based on segments and identity traits. All data sources are model objects, and no dynamic code execution or insecure data handling is evident. No external input processing, nor network communication, is present that could be malicious. The functions rely on model attributes and simple filtering or dict operations. There are no signs of backdoors, malicious data exfiltration, or code injection points.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard feature flag management implementation with no malicious behavior or security risks. It securely reads from internal models and performs filtering and overriding in a predictable manner. No evidence of malicious intent or security threats was identified.",
