{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to retrieve feature states for environments and identities, including filtering and overriding based on segments and traits.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment, identity, trait, and feature models, especially environment.feature_states, identity.identity_features, and get_identity_segments() function.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external output functions are present; data is processed internally without external communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from models (environment, identity, traits) through filtering and override logic within functions, mainly for feature state retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors. Use of exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves feature states based on environment and identity, applying filters for enabled flags, segment matching, and identity overrides. No external inputs or outputs are manipulated in suspicious ways. No code injection or data leaks are evident. The functions rely on model data and filtering logic without risky operations. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe data handling detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for feature flag management with no malicious intent. It performs expected operations for feature state retrieval, filtering, and overriding, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
