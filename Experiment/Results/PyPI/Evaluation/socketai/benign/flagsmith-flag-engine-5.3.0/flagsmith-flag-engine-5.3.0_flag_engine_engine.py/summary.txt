  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent feature flag utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use, and the low risk score (around 0.1) is justified. External dependencies like get_identity_segments should be verified for security, but based on this code alone, there are no concerns."
