  "purpose": "Custom JSON encoder to serialize decimal.Decimal objects as int or float for JSON serialization.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; the code defines a class for converting decimal objects during JSON encoding.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the class simply overrides a method for internal data conversion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward and intended for data formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of json.JSONEncoder to handle decimal.Decimal objects, converting them to int if they are whole numbers, or float otherwise. It ensures decimals from sources like boto3/dynamodb are correctly serialized in JSON format. There are no external inputs, no outputs, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The code serves a data formatting purpose without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility class for serializing decimals in JSON, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
