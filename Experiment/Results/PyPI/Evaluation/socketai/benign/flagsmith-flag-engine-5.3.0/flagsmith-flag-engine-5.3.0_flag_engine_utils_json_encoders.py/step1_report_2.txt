  "purpose": "Custom JSON encoder to convert decimal.Decimal objects to native int or float types for JSON serialization.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading input data; the code defines a class for encoding objects during JSON serialization.",
  "sinks": "The default() method in the custom encoder transforms decimal.Decimal instances into int or float, which could affect data integrity if misused.",
  "flows": "No external data sources or untrusted inputs are explicitly processed; the class is used during JSON serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard implementation of a custom JSON encoder for handling Decimal objects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class DecimalEncoder inheriting from json.JSONEncoder. It overrides the default method to convert decimal.Decimal objects into int if the decimal is an integer (no fractional part), or float otherwise. This is a common pattern when serializing DynamoDB data or similar data structures that use Decimal for numeric precision. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and functional, with no obfuscated or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves a benign purpose of customizing JSON serialization for Decimal objects. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present. It appears to be a standard utility class without any harmful or suspicious features.",
