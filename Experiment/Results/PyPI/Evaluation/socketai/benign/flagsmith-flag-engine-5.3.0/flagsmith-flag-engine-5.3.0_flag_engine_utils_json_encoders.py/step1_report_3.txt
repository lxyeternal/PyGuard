  "purpose": "Custom JSON encoder to convert decimal.Decimal objects into int or float for JSON serialization.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the code does not read external input but may be used in contexts where data is serialized.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent to external systems or written to files within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only defines a class and method without any data flow execution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of json.JSONEncoder with a custom default method to handle decimal.Decimal objects. It checks if the decimal number is an integer value and converts it accordingly, otherwise to float. The class is intended for use in serializing data structures that include decimal.Decimal instances, common when working with DynamoDB via boto3. There are no sources of untrusted input, no external data flows, and no suspicious code patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for data serialization, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
