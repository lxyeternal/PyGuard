  "purpose": "Calculate a consistent floating point number between 0 and 100 based on the hash of a list of object IDs.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'object_ids', which is an iterable of object IDs, and the 'iterations' parameter.",
  "sinks": "Hashing function (hashlib.md5) and recursive call to itself, but no data output or external data sink is present.",
  "flows": "The object IDs are joined into a string, hashed, converted to an integer, and then used to compute a percentage; in case of boundary case (value=100), the function recurses with increased iterations.",
  "anomalies": "Recursive call to handle an unlikely edge case where the value equals 100, which is a safe fallback mechanism. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code generates a deterministic hash-based percentage from input object IDs. It employs standard hashing (MD5), with control to prevent boundary value of 100 via recursion. No untrusted external data is processed beyond input parameters, and no side effects or data leaks are present. The recursion is well-guarded and unlikely to cause issues. The use of hashing and percentage calculation appears benign and intended for some form of consistent pseudo-random distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended to generate a consistent percentage based on input IDs, with safeguards against edge cases. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified.",
