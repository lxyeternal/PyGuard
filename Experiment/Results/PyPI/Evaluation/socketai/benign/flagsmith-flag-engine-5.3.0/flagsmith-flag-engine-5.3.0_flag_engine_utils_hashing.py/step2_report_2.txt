  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Purpose: Deterministically computes a float percentage (0 ≤ value < 100) based on hashing a list of object IDs.\n- Method: Concatenate IDs into a string, hash with MD5, convert to int, scale to percentage.\n- Edge case: If the value equals 100, recurse with increased iterations to get a different value.\n- No external system interactions, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- Use of MD5 is acceptable here since it's not cryptographically secure but sufficient for non-security purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, recursion is safe.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Well reasoned, code is benign, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound and reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, recursion is safe.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the function as benign, deterministic, and safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** Recursion for boundary case is safe.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly states the code is benign, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Observation:** The securityRisk score is 0.2, which seems slightly elevated given the benign nature. The only potential concern might be the recursion, but it's safe here.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly higher than necessary but still reasonable; no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses recursion for edge case, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately describes the code as benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** Recursion is safe.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly states the code is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation, with some reports assigning 0.1 or 0.2. Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, a score of 0 or 0.1 seems more appropriate. The recursion is safe, and no secrets or external calls exist.\n\n### My Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Security Risk:** **0** (no vulnerabilities or risky patterns)\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The recursion to avoid returning exactly 100 is a safe safeguard, not a security concern.\n- The use of MD5 is acceptable here, given the non-security-critical context.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Security Risk   | 0              |\n\nThis function is a benign utility for deterministic percentage calculation, with no malicious or security concern.",
