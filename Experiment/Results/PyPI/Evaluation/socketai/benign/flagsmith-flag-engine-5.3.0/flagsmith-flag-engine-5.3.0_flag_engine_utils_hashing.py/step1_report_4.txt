  "purpose": "Calculate a deterministic float percentage based on hashed object IDs, likely for consistent distribution or partitioning purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'object_ids' parameter (iterable of SupportsStr), and the 'iterations' parameter.",
  "sinks": "Uses hashlib.md5 to hash the concatenated string of object IDs; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input object IDs are converted to string, joined, and hashed; the hash is converted to an integer, then mapped to a percentage. In case of a boundary value, the function recursively repeats with increased iterations.",
  "anomalies": "The recursive call to handle the unlikely case of getting a value of exactly 100 is unusual but not inherently malicious. The use of MD5 is not secure for cryptographic purposes but acceptable here for non-security-critical hashing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a deterministic hash-based calculation to generate a floating-point percentage value from input object IDs. It joins IDs into a string, hashes with MD5, and maps the hash to a value between 0 and just under 100. The recursion to avoid a boundary value (exactly 100) is a safeguard. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The only notable aspect is the use of MD5, which is insecure cryptographically but not necessarily malicious in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility function for deterministic percentage calculation based on object IDs. No malicious intent or security threats are evident.",
