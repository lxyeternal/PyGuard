  "purpose": "Deterministically computes a floating point percentage between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (exclusive) based on hashing a list of object IDs, ensuring consistent results across calls.",
  "sources": "Reads input object IDs, joins them into a string, and encodes for hashing.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system interactions; purely computational.",
  "flows": "Concatenates object IDs, hashes with MD5, converts hash to integer, scales to percentage, with recursion to handle edge case where value equals 100.",
  "anomalies": "Uses recursion to avoid returning exactly 100, which is a safe safeguard; employs MD5, which is insecure for cryptographic purposes but acceptable here for non-security hashing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, deterministic utility function that hashes a list of object IDs to produce a percentage. It employs MD5 for hashing, which is acceptable given the non-security context. The recursion for the rare case where the value equals 100 is a safe, controlled safeguard. No external calls, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The function's behavior is benign, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent. The minor security concern related to MD5's cryptographic weaknesses does not translate into a security risk in this context. The code is clear, simple, and free of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, deterministic utility for mapping object IDs to a percentage. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The use of MD5 is acceptable for non-security purposes, and the recursion safeguard is safe. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
