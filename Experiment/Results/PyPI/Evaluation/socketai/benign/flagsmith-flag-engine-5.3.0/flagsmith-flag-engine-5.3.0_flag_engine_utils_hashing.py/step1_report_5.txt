  "purpose": "Calculate a deterministic floating point percentage based on hashed object IDs, ensuring consistent results across calls.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'object_ids' which is an iterable of object IDs, and 'iterations' parameter for repeated hashing.",
  "sinks": "Hashing operation using hashlib.md5; no external data sinks or network calls present.",
  "flows": "Input 'object_ids' -> join into string -> hash with md5 -> convert to int -> compute percentage -> possible recursive call for edge case.",
  "anomalies": "Recursion for edge case to avoid returning 100; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious data handling; standard hashing usage.",
  "analysis": "The code takes an iterable of object IDs, converts them into a comma-separated string, and hashes this string using MD5 to produce a deterministic value. The hash is then converted into an integer, which is used to compute a percentage between 0 and just below 100. The function includes a recursive call to handle a rare edge case where the percentage might be exactly 100, increasing the iterations to alter the hash. No external network access, no data exfiltration, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of MD5 for hashing is common for non-security-critical purposes like generating consistent hashes. No obfuscation or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely for deterministic percentage calculation based on object IDs. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
