  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, deterministic utility for mapping object IDs to a percentage. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The use of MD5 is acceptable for non-security purposes, and the recursion safeguard is safe. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent."
