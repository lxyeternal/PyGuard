  "purpose": "Calculate a deterministic floating-point percentage based on hashing a list of object IDs.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'object_ids' input parameter and 'iterations' parameter; uses the 'hashlib.md5' function to generate a hash from the concatenated string of object IDs.",
  "sinks": "Uses the hash digest and converts it into an integer for computation; no external or untrusted system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input 'object_ids' and 'iterations' are concatenated into a string, hashed with MD5, converted to an integer, and then scaled to a percentage value. If the value equals 100, the function recurses with increased iterations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; the function is straightforward and deterministic. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution. The recursion is controlled and based on hash results.",
  "analysis": "The code computes a hash-based percentage from a list of object IDs, ensuring consistency for the same input. The use of MD5 is for non-cryptographic purposes, which is acceptable here. The recursive call ensures the returned value is always less than 100. No external data sources, system commands, or network activity are involved. The code appears clean, well-structured, and free of malicious constructs or obfuscation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless utility function that deterministically computes a percentage based on input object IDs. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risk in this code snippet.",
