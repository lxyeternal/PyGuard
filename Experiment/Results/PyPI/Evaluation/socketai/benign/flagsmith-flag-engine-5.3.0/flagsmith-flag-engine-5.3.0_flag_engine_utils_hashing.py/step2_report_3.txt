  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code computes a deterministic percentage from object IDs, using MD5, with recursion to avoid returning 100.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious behavior; straightforward, deterministic, and safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with no malicious intent, just deterministic hashing.\n- **Findings:** Uses recursion for edge case; no external calls or secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility function.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same core logic, with a slightly higher confidence (0.9). Slightly higher securityRisk (0.2), but still no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** Use of recursion, MD5, no external data. Slightly higher securityRisk perhaps due to the recursion or the nature of the hash, but still benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar, with no suspicious activity. MD5 is insecure cryptographically but acceptable for non-security purposes.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, just a utility function.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, benign deterministic calculation.\n- **Findings:** No external calls, no obfuscation, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None of the reports identify any malicious code or behavior. The use of MD5 is standard for non-security hashing, and the recursion is a safe fallback.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is present; code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** The only minor concern might be the recursion, but it is controlled and only triggered in an extremely unlikely edge case. No external data or system interaction is involved.\n\n### Scores Justification:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, as code is clear.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, but perhaps slightly higher than 0 due to recursion, though it's safe here. The assigned scores (mostly 0 or 0.1/0.2) seem reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- The code appears to be a benign utility for deterministic percentage calculation.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The slight difference in securityRisk scores (0.1 or 0.2) is acceptable given the recursion safeguard, but overall, the risk remains minimal.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — clear code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — very low; the recursion is safe, and no external interactions are involved.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the scoring aligns with the code's benign nature. The function is a straightforward, deterministic, non-malicious utility.",
