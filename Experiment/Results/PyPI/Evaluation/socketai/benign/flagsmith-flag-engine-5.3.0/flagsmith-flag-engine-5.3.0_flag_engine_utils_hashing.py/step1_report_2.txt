{
  "purpose": "Calculate a deterministic floating point percentage based on the hash of a list of object IDs.",
  "sources": "Uses the 'hashlib.md5' function to generate a hash from the concatenated string of IDs.",
  "sinks": "Converts the hash digest to an integer, performs modulo operation, and returns a float value.",
  "flows": "Input 'object_ids' → string concatenation → hashing → integer conversion → modulo and scaling → return value. Recursion occurs if the value equals 100.",
  "anomalies": "Uses recursion to handle rare edge case where calculated value equals 100; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code deterministically hashes a list of IDs and maps the hash to a percentage value between 0 and 100, ensuring consistent output for the same input. The use of hashlib.md5 is standard for hashing; no malicious behavior or backdoors are present. The recursion handles a rare edge case but does not introduce security concerns. There are no untrusted data injections, network calls, or malicious payloads. The code is straightforward and adheres to common practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign, deterministic calculation based on hashing input IDs. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears to be a utility function for percentile calculations, with no signs of malicious intent or malware.",
