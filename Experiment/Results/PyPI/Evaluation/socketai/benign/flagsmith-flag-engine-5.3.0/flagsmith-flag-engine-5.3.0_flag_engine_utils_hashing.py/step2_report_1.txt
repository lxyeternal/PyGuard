  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a straightforward utility function that hashes a list of object IDs and maps the hash to a percentage between 0 and just below 100.\n- Uses MD5, which is not cryptographically secure but acceptable here since the purpose is not security but deterministic distribution.\n- The recursion to handle the rare case where the value equals 100 is a safeguard, not malicious.\n- No external system calls, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious elements.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly states the function is benign, deterministic, and uses MD5 appropriately for non-security purposes.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. Reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues.  \n**Scores:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2:\n- Similar to Report 1, with slight variation in confidence (0.9 vs 1).  \n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct, the code is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no malicious intent.  \n**Scores:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3:\n- Slightly higher confidence (0.9), but still consistent.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.2 — perhaps overestimating the risk due to recursion or use of MD5?  \n- **Malware:** 0, which is correct.\n\n**Justification for securityRisk=0.2:**  \nThe code's recursion is safe, and no external data or malicious behavior is present. The use of MD5 is not malicious but insecure for cryptographic purposes, which could be considered a minor risk, but not security-critical here. Assigning 0.2 is acceptable, though it might be slightly high given the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4:\n- Similar to others, with consistent reasoning.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware:** 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5:\n- Slightly lower securityRisk (0.1), consistent with the benign analysis.\n- **Malware:** 0, which is correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations but generally low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 across all reports — correct.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.  \n**Risk score:** Given the code's benign purpose, I would assign a **risk score of around 0.0 to 0.1**. The only minor concern is the use of MD5, which is insecure for cryptography but acceptable here, so I lean toward **0.0**.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment.\n- The code is a harmless utility function for deterministic percentage calculation.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.\n- Slight overestimation of risk in some reports is understandable but not necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0, and set the risk score to 0.0.",
