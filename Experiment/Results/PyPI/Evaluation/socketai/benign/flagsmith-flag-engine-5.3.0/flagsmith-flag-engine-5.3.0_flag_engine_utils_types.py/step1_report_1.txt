{
  "purpose": "Provide a utility to obtain type-specific casting functions for various input types, including custom handling for semantic versions.",
  "sources": "None; the code reads only input variables to determine the return value based on their type.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input type detection determines which casting function to return; no data flows from external sources to vulnerable sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses Python's singledispatch to provide type-specific functions, which is a standard pattern. It includes handling for basic types and a custom version object. No external network calls, file operations, or environment variable manipulations are present. The functions are straightforward, returning standard casting functions or a custom function for semver versions. The code appears well-structured and secure, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for type-based function retrieval. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks. It is standard and safe.",
