{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python package module, likely intended for general functionality within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables and possibly user input via standard input or parameters (if any). The code reads environment variables such as 'API_KEY' and 'SECRET'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (if present), file system writes, and environment variables. However, no explicit sinks like network calls or file writes are evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables to internal variables; no data is shown being transmitted or sent externally within the snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials are directly visible; code structure is straightforward. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. No suspicious backdoors or malicious functions are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code reads certain environment variables that could contain sensitive data but does not perform any operations that suggest malicious intent. There are no signs of network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The usage of environment variables is standard practice. The code does not include dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for legitimate data handling within the application context.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code is straightforward and does not include any suspicious or harmful operations. The security risk is minimal, and the likelihood of malware presence is low.",
