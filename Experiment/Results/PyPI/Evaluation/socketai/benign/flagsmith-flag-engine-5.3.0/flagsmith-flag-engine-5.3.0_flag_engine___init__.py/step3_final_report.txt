  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential input points include environment variables, dynamic code execution functions like eval()/exec(), and data handling routines.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows through eval()/exec(), dynamic imports, network connections, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or untrusted input pass through eval()/exec() or dynamic imports, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() with untrusted data, obfuscation indicators (e.g., complex string manipulations), lack of comments, or suspicious import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code appears mostly benign with routine data handling, environment variable reads, and no suspicious patterns. In reports mentioning eval()/exec() or obfuscation, suspicion exists but no confirmed malicious activity. Scores are generally consistent with the descriptions. For Report 2, if eval()/exec() are confirmed to be used with untrusted data, malware score should be increased from 0.2 to at least 0.5. Other reports are appropriately scored with low malware and risk levels. Confidence scores reflect the certainty based on summaries, with higher confidence in benign assessments. No obfuscation is detected outside suspected cases, and no malicious code is confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates low malicious intent across the analyzed dependencies. Report 2 warrants attention if eval()/exec() are confirmed with untrusted data, which would justify increasing malware risk. Otherwise, all scores are appropriate and reflect minimal security concerns.",
