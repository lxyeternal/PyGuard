{
  "purpose": "Define and schedule various background tasks using Huey, including simple arithmetic, sleeping, retries, and periodic tasks.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from function parameters, environment (via print), and internal library functions.",
  "sinks": "Print statements and task scheduling mechanisms, but no untrusted data is directly used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Parameters passed to tasks can be used for output or scheduling, but no external data flows into security-sensitive sinks in a harmful way.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. Use of retries and transaction-based task enqueuing is standard. No obfuscated code or malicious backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple tasks for execution via Huey, including arithmetic operations, sleeping, retries, periodic execution, and transaction-aware enqueuing. No external input handling, no network connections, no data leakage or malicious commands. All functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign set of task definitions for a background worker system, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
