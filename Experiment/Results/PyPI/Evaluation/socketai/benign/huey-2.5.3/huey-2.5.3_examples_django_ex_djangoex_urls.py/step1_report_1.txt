  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'patterns' function, which is outdated in modern Django versions; no malicious code or unusual behavior present",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'patterns' from Django's URL configuration module and defines an empty URL pattern list. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows indicating malicious activity. The usage of 'patterns' is outdated but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply sets up an empty URL configuration with deprecated syntax. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
