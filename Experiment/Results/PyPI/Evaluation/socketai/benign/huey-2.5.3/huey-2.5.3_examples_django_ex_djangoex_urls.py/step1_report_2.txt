{
  "purpose": "Define URL patterns for a Django application",
  "sources": "No data input sources present",
  "sinks": "No sink operations or data handling points present",
  "flows": "No data flow; code is solely defining URL patterns",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated Django function 'patterns', which is unnecessary in newer Django versions; no malicious anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'patterns' function from 'django.conf.urls' and defines an empty URL pattern list. The use of 'patterns' indicates outdated Django version code but is not malicious. No input, no data handling, no suspicious logic or code flow. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, non-malicious Django URL configuration snippet using deprecated syntax. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
