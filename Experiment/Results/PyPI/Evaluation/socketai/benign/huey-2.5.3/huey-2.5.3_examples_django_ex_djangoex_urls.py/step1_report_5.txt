  "sources": "No input or data reading observed",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations observed",
  "flows": "No data flow present",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'patterns' function in Django, which is outdated and potentially insecure in modern Django versions",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'patterns' from 'django.conf.urls' and defines an empty URL pattern list using 'patterns'. The use of 'patterns' is deprecated since Django 1.10 and no URL patterns are actually specified. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as data leakage, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a placeholder or incomplete URL configuration with no active functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, possibly outdated placeholder for Django URL configuration without malicious intent or security risks. However, the use of deprecated functions suggests it may not be up-to-date or complete.",
