  "purpose": "Define URL patterns for a Django application using the deprecated 'patterns' function.",
  "sources": "The code does not read any external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident in this minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated Django 'patterns' function; no security anomalies or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'patterns' from 'django.conf.urls' and defines an empty 'urlpatterns' list using 'patterns'. This is a deprecated approach in newer Django versions but not inherently malicious. No external input is processed, no data is transmitted, and no suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, harmless Django URL configuration snippet using outdated syntax. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
