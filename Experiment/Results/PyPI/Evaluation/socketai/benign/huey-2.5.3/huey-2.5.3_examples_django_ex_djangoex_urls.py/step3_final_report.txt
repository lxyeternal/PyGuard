  "purpose": "Minimal Django URL configuration using deprecated 'patterns' function, with no active URL patterns.",
  "sources": "Import of 'patterns' from 'django.conf.urls', definition of 'urlpatterns' as an empty list.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, input/output, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists; code simply defines an empty URL pattern list.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'patterns' function; code is minimal and empty, indicating placeholder or outdated syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a deprecated Django function 'patterns' and defines an empty URL pattern list. There are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or suspicious operations. The use of outdated syntax is noted but does not pose a security threat. The code's simplicity and lack of data handling confirm the absence of malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate, with minor concern over maintainability rather than security. Overall, the code is benign, with the main issue being outdated syntax that could affect future compatibility but not security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal Django URL configuration snippet using deprecated syntax. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are present. The minor security risk score reflects the outdated syntax, which is a maintainability concern rather than a security issue.",
