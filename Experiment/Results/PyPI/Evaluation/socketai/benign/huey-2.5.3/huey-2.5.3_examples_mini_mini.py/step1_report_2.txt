{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a task queue system using Huey with gevent for concurrency, allowing scheduling and execution of asynchronous tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function calls and arguments, such as add(1, 2) and add.schedule(args=(10, 20), delay=2).",
  "sinks": "The code executes tasks asynchronously and prints results, but does not directly send data to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., 1, 2, 10, 20) flow into the add task, which then executes asynchronously; scheduled tasks are queued with delay, and results are retrieved and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of gevent monkey patching and Huey appears standard for asynchronous task scheduling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports gevent and patches all for concurrency support. It initializes a MiniHuey instance for task management, starts the scheduler, defines an addition task, executes the task immediately, schedules a delayed task, and then stops the scheduler. All operations appear typical for a task queue setup without any malicious behavior or suspicious code patterns. No external data leaks, malicious code, or backdoors are present. The code operates within expected bounds for task scheduling and execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for asynchronous task execution using Huey and gevent, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for background task processing without any suspicious or malicious actions.",
