{
  "purpose": "The code sets up and demonstrates the use of a task queue system (Huey) with gevent for asynchronous task execution and scheduling.",
  "sources": "The code reads function input parameters (a, b) from function calls and schedules task execution via huey.schedule.",
  "sinks": "The scheduled task results are retrieved with res() and printed; no direct data leaks or untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed to add(), which are then executed asynchronously, and scheduled tasks are executed after a delay, with results retrieved via res().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard library functions and third-party modules as intended. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports gevent and patches all to enable cooperative multitasking, then initializes a huey instance for task management. A simple addition task is defined, scheduled for delayed execution, and its result is retrieved and printed. No input validation or external data sources are involved beyond standard function calls. The code appears to be a straightforward demonstration of scheduling and executing asynchronous tasks using huey and gevent. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The use of third-party libraries is standard and within expected patterns for asynchronous task execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of setting up and using huey with gevent for asynchronous task scheduling. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
