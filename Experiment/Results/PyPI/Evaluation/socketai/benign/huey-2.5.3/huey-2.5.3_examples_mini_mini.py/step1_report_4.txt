{
  "purpose": "The code sets up and uses a task queue system with scheduled and periodic task execution using Huey and gevent for concurrency.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function arguments in add() calls, which are hardcoded in the script.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the task execution via huey, which processes the add() function with provided arguments.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded input (e.g., add(1, 2), add.schedule(args=(10, 20), delay=2)) to task execution managed by huey, with no external untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard libraries and functions for task scheduling and concurrency without suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes gevent's monkey patching for asynchronous concurrency, sets up a huey task queue, defines a simple add() task, executes the task immediately and with delay, and then stops the scheduler. All components are standard and do not involve any malicious or suspicious activity. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious code behavior. The use of scheduled tasks and concurrency appears intended for typical asynchronous job processing.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs typical task scheduling and execution using well-known libraries without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided code.",
