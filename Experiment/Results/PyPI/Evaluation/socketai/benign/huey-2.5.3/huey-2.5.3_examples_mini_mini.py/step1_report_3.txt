{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a task queue system using Huey with gevent monkey patching for concurrency, scheduling tasks and executing them asynchronously.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function arguments (add function calls and schedule parameters). It also imports modules and initializes objects.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the add function; potential data flow from scheduled tasks to execution results; printing results to stdout.",
  "flows": "Inputs (add arguments and scheduling delays) flow into the add task execution, which is run asynchronously via huey, then results are retrieved and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for a task queue setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports and applies gevent monkey patching, initializes a Huey task queue, and defines a simple addition task. It starts the scheduler, runs a task synchronously, then schedules another task with a delay, and finally stops the scheduler. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors. The functions and module usage are typical for a task scheduling application. The code does not handle untrusted input from external sources, nor does it contain any suspicious code flows or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for asynchronous task processing with Huey and gevent. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
