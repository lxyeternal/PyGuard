{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a task queue using the Huey library with gevent monkey patching for asynchronous task execution and scheduling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the function arguments (add), and from the scheduling call add.schedule() with specified args and delay.",
  "sinks": "The scheduled tasks and task results are executed asynchronously; the code prints the task result. No external data sink or network communication is directly visible.",
  "flows": "Input arguments (a, b) are passed to add(), which computes and returns the sum. The scheduled call add.schedule() delays execution of add with specific args.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports gevent and patches all, enabling cooperative greenlets. It initializes a MiniHuey instance and starts it, which manages task scheduling. The add function is a simple addition task decorated for asynchronous execution. It is invoked directly and also scheduled with a delay. The flow of data is straightforward: input args go into add, results are retrieved and printed. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration. The code uses standard libraries and patterns for asynchronous task queues without suspicious modifications or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard asynchronous task queue with scheduled execution using Huey and gevent. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The structure and behavior appear typical for such an application.",
