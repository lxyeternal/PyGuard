{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a task queue using Huey with gevent monkey patching, defines a simple addition task, executes it immediately, schedules a delayed execution, and then stops the scheduler.",
  "sources": "Arguments passed to the add() function, internal Huey scheduling functions",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows; no network or data exfiltration observed",
  "flows": "Input arguments (a, b) flow into the add() task; results are computed locally; scheduled tasks are managed internally by Huey",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of asynchronous task scheduling with Huey and gevent. It defines a simple addition task, executes it immediately, schedules it with a delay, and stops the scheduler. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious behavior are present. The code uses standard libraries and patterns, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The security implications are minimal, and the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard example of task scheduling using Huey and gevent. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the analysis.",
