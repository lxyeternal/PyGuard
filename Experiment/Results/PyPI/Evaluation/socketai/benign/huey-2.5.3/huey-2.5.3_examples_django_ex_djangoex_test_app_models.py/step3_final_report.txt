  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network calls, subprocess executions, dynamic eval/exec statements.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writing, subprocess execution, environment variable access, potential data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, network inputs) potentially flow into eval/exec, network communication, or data storage points.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), suspicious control flow, hardcoded URLs or credentials, unusual variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in most reports, with no malicious activity detected; obfuscation is moderate but not malicious. Report 5 shows significant obfuscation and dynamic eval/exec usage, strongly indicating malicious intent. The scores in reports 1-4 are consistent with their benign descriptions, with malware scores at 0 and low security risks. Report 5's higher scores are justified by the suspicious patterns. Slightly increasing report 5's malware score from 0.6 to 0.7 could better reflect the high suspicion, but 0.6 remains acceptable.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with no malicious behavior, but report 5 indicates significant obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting caution. The current scoring aligns well with the evidence, with a minor potential adjustment for report 5's malware score to reflect the suspicion level more accurately.",
