  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or manipulation tasks, but the specific purpose is unclear due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Input is read from environment variables, function parameters, or external files (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Data may be written to files, printed to stdout, or sent over the network, but specifics are not provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions through processing functions to sinks like output functions or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code constructs, or obfuscated patterns are detected. No unusual behaviors such as code injection or data exfiltration are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure was examined thoroughly, including any dynamic code execution, use of third-party libraries, or network communications. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or security flaws were identified. The code appears standard and adheres to typical Python coding practices. Without additional context or external inputs, there is no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.",
