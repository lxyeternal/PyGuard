  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'huey' task queue Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst for long_description, importing package version, package discovery, reading environment variables (indirectly via setup), and including scripts.",
  "sinks": "Execution of setup() with configuration data, importing package __version__, reading files.",
  "flows": "Reading README.rst -> setting package metadata -> importing __version__ -> configuring setup() parameters -> executing setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code is standard for Python package setup. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a conventional setup.py for a Python package, using standard library functions and setuptools to configure package details. It reads a README file, defines dependencies, and specifies entry points for command-line scripts. It imports the package's version dynamically, which is common. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. No code injection, external network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The overall structure is typical for package distribution and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical setup tasks without any suspicious or malicious code. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
