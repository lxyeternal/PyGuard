  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for a Python package, with no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behaviors.\n- It imports the package version dynamically, which is common practice.\n- It reads the README file for long description.\n- It defines dependencies, classifiers, entry points, and scripts.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no code injection, no external data processing.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code, no malicious behaviors.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — **appropriate**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — **appropriate**\n- **Security risk:** 0 — **appropriate**\n\n**Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, no suspicious code, no malicious behaviors.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — **appropriate**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — **appropriate**\n- **Security risk:** 0 — **appropriate**\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Similar to above, with an exception: securityRisk is noted as 0.1.\n- **Analysis:** The script is standard; no dynamic code, no network activity.\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1 — seems slightly high given the code's benign nature.\n\n**Justification:** The only reason for a non-zero security risk might be the presence of the `consumer_main` entry point, which could potentially be used maliciously if the function itself is malicious. But based solely on the setup script, there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Recommendation:** I would suggest lowering the securityRisk score to 0, as the setup script alone doesn't pose a security risk.\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, standard setup script.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.0 or 0.1? The report states 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, no suspicious code.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1 — again, perhaps slightly high for a static setup script.\n\n**Recommendation:** Lower to 0, unless there's external context not visible here.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, correct.\n- **Risk:** Most reports assign 0 or 0.1. Given the benign nature, I recommend all to be 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The code is a typical, safe setup script.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The slight elevation in security risk scores (0.1) in some reports seems unwarranted; I suggest lowering all to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n| Score Type     | Value |\n|----------------|--------|\n| Malware        | 0      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0      |\n| Security Risk  | 0      |\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a standard, safe package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. The minor security risk scores assigned in some reports should be lowered to 0 for consistency and accuracy.",
