  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'huey' Python package, including package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst file, importing version from huey module, setting package data, and defining console scripts.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'consumer_main' function, reading files, importing modules, and referencing package data.",
  "flows": "Reading README file -> Importing version -> Setup parameters including entry points -> Executing 'consumer_main' via console script.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious file operations, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code. Usage of standard setup tools and clear structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration script for a Python package. It reads a README file, sets dependencies, defines package metadata, and configures entry points and scripts. All operations are standard and do not involve untrusted input, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious side effects are apparent. The import of the version from the package itself is common practice. No anomalies such as obfuscated code or hidden network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard and benign setup script for the 'huey' package with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior detected.",
