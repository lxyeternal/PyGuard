It follows standard Django initialization practices without obfuscated code, suspicious behaviors, or malicious patterns. No external data is being sent or received; no suspicious code execution paths are evident. The code is straightforward and typical for Django apps.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard Django management launcher with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up the environment and runs commands based on user input.",
