  "purpose": "This script initializes environment variables and runs Django management commands.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables and command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "execute_from_command_line which may process untrusted command-line arguments",
  "flows": "sys.argv → execute_from_command_line",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code sets a default environment variable for Django settings and then executes Django management commands based on command-line input. It uses standard Django initialization procedures without any obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors. The environment variable setting is typical for Django projects, and the command execution relies on provided sys.argv arguments. No malicious payloads or abnormal patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django management script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It securely sets the environment and executes commands, assuming proper use and trusted inputs.",
