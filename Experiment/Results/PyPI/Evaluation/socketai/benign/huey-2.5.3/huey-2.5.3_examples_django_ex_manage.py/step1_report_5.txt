  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected; standard Django startup pattern",
  "analysis": "The code sets a Django environment variable and runs the Django command-line interface. It relies on sys.argv for command input, which is typical for Django management scripts. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification beyond standard Django startup routines.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard Django management entry point with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
