  "purpose": "Standard Django management script initializing environment and executing command-line tasks.",
  "sources": "Environment variable setting via os.environ.setdefault() and command-line arguments sys.argv",
  "sinks": "execute_from_command_line(sys.argv) processing untrusted input from command line",
  "flows": "sys.argv passed directly to execute_from_command_line without validation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and adheres to typical Django patterns",
  "analysis": "The code sets a Django environment variable and executes management commands based on command-line input. It contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, network activity, or malicious code. The environment variable and command-line arguments are standard and safe in this context. No suspicious data flows or anomalies are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to common patterns suggest no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Django entry point with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores should reflect this benign nature.",
