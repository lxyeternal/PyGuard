  "flows": "N/A; the code is purely configuration with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard Sphinx documentation configuration without obfuscated code or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and the huey package to access its version info. It sets up paths and configuration options for Sphinx documentation generation. There are no inputs from external untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling. The code strictly serves as a static configuration file, with no embedded or executable malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no security risks.",
