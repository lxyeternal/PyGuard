{
  "purpose": "This code is a configuration script for Sphinx documentation, setting up project info, paths, and output options without executing any dynamic or external code.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, os, and huey.__version__; reads configuration variables and static paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network activity or data leaks; no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Static import of __version__ from local huey package; configuration parameters assigned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard, static configuration file for Sphinx documentation. It imports only trusted modules and sets configuration variables without any dynamic or external data handling. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The import of __version__ from the local huey package is typical and not suspicious. The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or code execution beyond static assignments. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. The supply chain security assessment is that it poses no threat, and the scores are appropriate.",
