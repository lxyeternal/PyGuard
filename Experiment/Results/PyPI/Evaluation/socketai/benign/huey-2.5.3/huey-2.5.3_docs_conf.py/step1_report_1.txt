  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling, external connections, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "sys.path modification and import of __version__ influence version info; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments present. The code is standard configuration without dynamic or unsafe code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx documentation configuration file. It sets up paths, project info, and output options without any network activity, data handling, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The absence of external data sources, suspicious imports, or code that manipulates untrusted inputs supports this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard configuration file for documentation generation. No malicious or security-threatening code is present.",
