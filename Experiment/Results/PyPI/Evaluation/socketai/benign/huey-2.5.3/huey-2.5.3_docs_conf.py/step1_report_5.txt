  "purpose": "Configuration file for building documentation using Sphinx for the 'huey' project.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, os, and huey.__version__; reads project path and version info; loads configuration settings for Sphinx.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external connections; no handling of user input or data output to insecure locations.",
  "flows": "Imports version info from huey.__version__ and inserts paths for documentation build; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; all code appears standard for a documentation configuration file. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx documentation configuration file with no dynamic or external data processing, no network activity, and no execution of untrusted code. The only imported modules are standard system modules and the project version. The code sets up documentation parameters without executing any runtime code that could be malicious. The structure and content align with common documentation build practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration script for documentation purposes, with no indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks.",
