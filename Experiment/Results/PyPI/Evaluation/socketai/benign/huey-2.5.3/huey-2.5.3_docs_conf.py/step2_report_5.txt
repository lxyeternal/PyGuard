  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**  \n   - **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no suspicious or malicious code. It notes the absence of untrusted data handling, external connections, or obfuscation.  \n   - **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — all appropriate.  \n   - **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound, and the scores are justified.\n\n2. **Report 2**  \n   - **Assessment:** The report similarly recognizes that the code is a typical configuration script, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. It emphasizes the safe import of version info and static setup.  \n   - **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n   - **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n3. **Report 3**  \n   - **Assessment:** Again, the analysis confirms the code is purely configuration with no external or malicious behavior. The import of `__version__` from the local huey package is benign.  \n   - **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — suitable.  \n   - **Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Report 4**  \n   - **Assessment:** The report accurately describes the code as standard, with no dynamic or external data flows, no suspicious patterns, or obfuscation.  \n   - **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — justified.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Correctly assessed.\n\n5. **Report 5**  \n   - **Assessment:** The analysis correctly states that the code is a typical configuration file, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It notes the absence of dynamic code, external connections, or data leaks.  \n   - **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n   - **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify the code as benign configuration.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None detected; all reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Score appropriateness:** All malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are correctly set to 0, reflecting no malicious or risky behavior.\n- **Potential concerns:** None, as the code is static configuration with no external or dynamic components.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe Sphinx configuration file with no signs of supply chain security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The scores and reasoning across all reports are appropriate and justified.",
