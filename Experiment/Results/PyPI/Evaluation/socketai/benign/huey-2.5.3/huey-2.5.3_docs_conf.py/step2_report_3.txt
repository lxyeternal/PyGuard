  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Sphinx configuration script.\n- No external data flows, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The import of `__version__` from the local `huey` package is benign, assuming the package is trustworthy.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk is also 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The scores are uniformly low, which is appropriate given the code's content.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score is 0 in all reports, which is correct; there's no obfuscation.\n- The \"malware\" score is 0, which matches the analysis.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- Since the code is purely configuration, it does not perform any malicious actions.\n- Importing `__version__` from a local module is standard practice and not suspicious.\n- No evidence suggests any supply chain risk or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security threat identified)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis is a benign, standard configuration file with no signs of supply chain security issues or malware.",
