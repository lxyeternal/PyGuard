  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward setup script that includes a package data file (`METADATA.toml`) for the `yaml-stubs` package.\n- The code is minimal, static, and follows standard packaging practices.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware and security risk scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: it imports `setuptools.setup` and calls it with a static `package_data` argument.\n- The `package_data` specifies inclusion of `'METADATA.toml'` in the `'yaml-stubs'` package.\n- No issues with code correctness or malicious activity are apparent.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are present in the code or the report summaries.\n- The reasoning in each report is consistent and accurate.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct; there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score (0):** Correct; static configuration with no external data handling.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the reports uniformly describe the code as benign, and the code itself is simple, I agree with the assigned scores.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, benign packaging configuration snippet.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments, confirming that the code poses no security threat.",
