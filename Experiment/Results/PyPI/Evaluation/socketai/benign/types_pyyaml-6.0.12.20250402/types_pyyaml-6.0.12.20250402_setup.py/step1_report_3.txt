  "purpose": "To configure the package data for distribution using setuptools during the package installation process.",
  "sources": "The call to 'setup' with the 'package_data' parameter, which reads static configuration data for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted or external input; the code only sets static package data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the setup call is static and does not involve input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward use of setuptools for package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it with a static 'package_data' argument. There are no dynamic inputs, no processing of external data, and no suspicious code constructs. It appears to be a minimal, standard package setup configuration without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
