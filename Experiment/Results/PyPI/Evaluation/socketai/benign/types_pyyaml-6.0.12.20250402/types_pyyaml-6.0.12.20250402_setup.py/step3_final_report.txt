{
  "purpose": "The code is a minimal setup script for Python packaging, specifying inclusion of 'METADATA.toml' in the 'yaml-stubs' package.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup() call, specifically the 'package_data' argument.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with a static package_data argument, including a metadata file. It involves no dynamic code, external inputs, or network activity. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign packaging code, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm the absence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign packaging configuration snippet with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
