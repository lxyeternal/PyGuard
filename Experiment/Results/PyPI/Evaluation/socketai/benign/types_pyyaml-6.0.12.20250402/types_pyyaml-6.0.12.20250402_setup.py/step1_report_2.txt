{
  "purpose": "The code is used to configure the packaging of a Python project, specifically including package data files.",
  "sources": "The package_data argument in the setup() function, which reads a dictionary defining package contents.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input or output data to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static configuration for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward setup script with minimal configuration. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with a package_data parameter, specifying a metadata file within a package. This is typical in Python packaging. No external input handling, network communication, or code execution occurs. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script used for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
