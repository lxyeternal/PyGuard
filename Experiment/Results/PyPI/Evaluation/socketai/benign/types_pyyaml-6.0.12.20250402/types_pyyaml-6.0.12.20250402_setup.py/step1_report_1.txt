{
  "purpose": "The code is used to configure the package data for a Python package named 'yaml-stubs' by including a 'METADATA.toml' file during installation.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function call, specifically the 'package_data' argument, which specifies the inclusion of additional files in the package distribution.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data sinks are present in this code. The code only specifies static configuration data for packaging.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the import statement to the 'setup' function call, with no data flows involving untrusted input or external data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. It appears standard for packaging configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it with a 'package_data' argument, indicating inclusion of a specific metadata file in the package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external data handling, or suspicious code. The file appears to serve a legitimate purpose in packaging the Python module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard packaging configuration snippet with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply specifies static package data for distribution.",
