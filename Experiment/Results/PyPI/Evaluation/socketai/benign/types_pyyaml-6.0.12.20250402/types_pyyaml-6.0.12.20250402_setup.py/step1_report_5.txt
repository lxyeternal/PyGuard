{
  "purpose": "Configure package data for the 'yaml-stubs' package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads nothing from external sources; it only imports setuptools and calls setup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform any sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the setup call is straightforward with static package_data; no suspicious or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' module, a common package used for Python packaging. It then calls the 'setup' function with a 'package_data' argument that specifies static package data for 'yaml-stubs'. The data is a fixed list containing 'METADATA.toml'. There are no input sources, dynamic code execution, or data handling that could be malicious. The code appears to be a simple packaging configuration snippet with no obfuscation, suspicious logic, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup configuration snippet for packaging, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
