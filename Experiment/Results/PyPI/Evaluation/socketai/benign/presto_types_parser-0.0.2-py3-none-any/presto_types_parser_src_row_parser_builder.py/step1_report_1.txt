{
  "purpose": "The code builds a row parser for a data processing system, selecting appropriate cell processors based on column type signatures, including complex types like array, map, and row.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'columns' list passed to build_row_parser, and the 'typeSignature' dictionaries within each column object.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the processing functions invoked for each column type, such as build_array_processor, build_map_processor, and process_raw_cell, which handle column data.",
  "flows": "The flow involves extracting the column type from typeSignature, selecting the appropriate processor, and applying it to process the data within each column, ultimately constructing a PrestoRowParser.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for parsing structured data based on schema definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports well-defined modules for processing various column types and builds a parser accordingly. The logic checks column types and maps them to corresponding processing functions, supporting complex nested structures. No suspicious or obfuscated code patterns are observed. All functions perform expected schema-driven processing without dynamic code execution, eval, or external command calls. The code's structure is clear, and data flow follows typical schema parsing patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior or data exfiltration mechanisms. External module usage is justified for the parser's purpose, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate schema-driven parser builder for a data processing system, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
