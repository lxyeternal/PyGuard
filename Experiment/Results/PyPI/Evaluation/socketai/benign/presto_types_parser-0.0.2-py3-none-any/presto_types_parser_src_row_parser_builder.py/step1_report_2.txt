{
  "purpose": "This code constructs a row parser for a data processing system, building cell processors based on column type signatures.",
  "sources": "Code reads column type signatures from input data (columns parameter, column_type_signature argument), and from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential data processing functions (e.g., process_raw_cell) may handle untrusted data, but they are imported and not directly invoked with untrusted input within this code.",
  "flows": "Input column signatures flow through _build_cell_processor and _build_complex_cell_processor to build corresponding cell processors, which are used by PrestoRowParser.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic. Use of imported modules is standard, and no network activity or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs a parser by mapping column types to specific processor functions, using safe, static lookups and function calls. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or suspicious behaviors. All imported modules are part of a presumably trusted package. There are no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns. The logic is straightforward and aligns with standard data processing setup routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for building data parsers based on column type signatures. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The structure and imports are typical for a data processing module. Overall, there is no evidence of malware or security threats in this code.",
