{
  "purpose": "Builds a schema-driven row parser by mapping column type signatures to specific processing functions, facilitating data deserialization.",
  "sources": "Reads 'typeSignature' dictionaries from each column, and imports processing functions from external modules.",
  "sinks": "Passes data to imported processing functions; no external sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "From column type signatures to corresponding processing functions via internal lookup and function calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a parser based on schema definitions, using static mappings and imported modules for data type processing. It performs no network activity, code injection, or obfuscation. The imported modules are assumed trusted. The logic is straightforward, with clear type-based dispatching. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, schema-driven parser builder with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal inherent risk given the code's purpose and structure.",
