  "purpose": "Utility for parsing dictionary keys based on specified primitive types and processing cell values accordingly.",
  "sources": "raw_cell.items() (dictionary items), key_primitive_type input, process_inner_raw_cell function input",
  "sinks": "None directly; the code processes data in-memory without external output or network operations",
  "flows": "parse_key (based on key_primitive_type) applied to map_key; processed value from process_inner_raw_cell assigned to processed_cell[parsed_key]",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward key parsing and value processing; no obfuscation or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of parsers for primitive types, defaults to identity parser, and creates a processing function that applies the parser to each key in a dictionary, then processes each value with a provided function. It handles None inputs gracefully. The code is simple, with no network, file, or external code execution, and no suspicious constructs. The reports provided are empty responses with no detailed data or evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or anomalies. Given the lack of concrete data, no issues or malicious behavior can be inferred. The code appears safe, and the reports do not indicate any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for key parsing and value processing with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The reports lack sufficient data to suggest any security issues. Therefore, the overall malware, obfuscation, and risk scores should be zero or near-zero, reflecting no detected threats.",
