  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The provided code appears to be a utility for parsing keys in a map/dictionary, converting keys based on their primitive type, and processing cell values via a provided function.\n   - The code itself does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n   - The reports indicate \"Empty response\" for all five reports, which suggests that the raw_response data is empty or missing.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Summary:**\n   - The reports do not contain any specific details about the content of the responses or any anomalies.\n   - The \"error\" field only states \"Empty response,\" which is a generic message and does not provide insight into potential security issues.\n   - Since the raw_response is empty, there is no evidence of malicious payloads, malformed data, or vulnerabilities being exploited.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - Malware score: Since no actual data or suspicious activity is present, the malware score should be very low or zero.\n   - Obfuscated score: No obfuscation is evident from the code or the reports, so this should also be low.\n   - Risk score: Given the lack of data and no apparent vulnerabilities, the overall risk should be minimal.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code involves parsing and processing data, which could be risky if the data is malicious. However, with empty responses, no such risk is currently demonstrated.\n   - The code itself is generic and does not perform any dangerous operations like executing code, network access, or file modifications.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - Any claim that the code is malicious or vulnerable based solely on empty responses is unfounded.\n   - Without actual payloads or anomalies, it's speculative to assign high malware or risk scores.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Report:**\n   - Since all responses are empty, the scores should reflect no detected malicious activity or obfuscation.\n   - Assigning high scores without evidence would be unreasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, primarily due to lack of data, but no real threat)\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The reports lack substantive content; therefore, no security issues can be confirmed.\n- The utility code appears safe and standard.\n- If future responses contain actual data, a re-evaluation would be necessary.\n\n**Summary:** Based on the provided information, there is no indication of a supply chain security incident or malicious activity. The scores should remain very low, reflecting the absence of evidence.",
