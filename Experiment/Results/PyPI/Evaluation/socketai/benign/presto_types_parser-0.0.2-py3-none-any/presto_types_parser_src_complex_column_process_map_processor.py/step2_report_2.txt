  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality and Logic:**\n   - The code defines a `key_parsers` dictionary for parsing keys based on their primitive types.\n   - The `_default_key_parser` returns the key as-is.\n   - The `new_map_process_function` creates a processing function that:\n     - Uses the appropriate parser based on `key_primitive_type`.\n     - Processes each key-value pair in `raw_cell`, parsing the key and processing the value with `process_inner_raw_cell`.\n   - Handles `None` inputs gracefully.\n\n2. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All reports indicate `\"error\": \"Empty response\"` with an empty `raw_response`.\n   - No specific details about the data or the context of the incident are provided.\n   - The reports do not contain any evidence of code execution, malicious activity, or vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Assessment of Report Validity and Potential Issues:**\n   - The reports are essentially empty responses, which do not demonstrate any actual security incident or vulnerability.\n   - No evidence suggests that the code is executing malicious behavior, handling malicious inputs, or is vulnerable to injection or other attacks.\n   - The code appears to be a standard key-value processing utility, with no obvious security flaws.\n\n4. **Error in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are not informative; they only show empty responses with no additional context.\n   - The lack of raw response data prevents any meaningful security analysis or confirmation of issues.\n\n5. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Given the absence of any malicious activity or payloads, the malware score should be **0**.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. Score should be **0**.\n   - **Risk Score:** Since there's no evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or flaws, the overall risk score should be **0**.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any dangerous operations like executing external code, handling untrusted data insecurely, or exposing attack surfaces.\n   - The only potential concern could be the key parsing functions if malicious keys are used, but the current parser simply converts keys to integers or floats, which is not inherently dangerous.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The reports do not provide any concrete evidence of security issues.\n   - The code appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.\n   - The scores should all be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe reports are essentially empty and do not warrant any concern based on the provided data.",
