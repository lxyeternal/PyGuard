  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potentially suspicious imports, hardcoded strings, dynamic code execution, environment variables, network connections, subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system access, environment variable reading, subprocess execution, data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (e.g., environment variables, network data) to sinks (network, file, subprocess), possibly via obfuscated or dynamic code paths.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation score (0.8), signs of dynamic code execution, suspicious hardcoded URLs/strings, unusual import patterns, potential code injection points.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are typical indicators of malicious intent. The high obfuscation score (0.8) and malware suspicion (0.6) are justified based on behavioral patterns. The code's structure suggests possible data exfiltration or backdoor functionalities, especially if network or subprocess calls are involved. The other reports show no such signs, with scores reflecting benign or incomplete code. The overall assessment indicates a moderate to high risk primarily associated with Report 1, with the scores aligning with observed behaviors. Static analysis supports these conclusions, though runtime testing could further confirm malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and suspicious behaviors in Report 1, warranting cautious handling and further dynamic analysis. The other reports are consistent with benign code. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily driven by Report 1's indicators.",
