  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the correctness of the conclusions, the appropriateness of the scores, and any potential issues.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe a single import statement: `from presto_types_parser.src.row_parser_builder import build_row_parser`.\n- The reports uniformly classify this as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the minimal code snippet.\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis that no malicious behavior is evident.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct since the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n\n**Issue Presence:**  \n- All reports agree that the code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior.  \n- There are no signs of code injection, dynamic execution, or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- **No issues are present in the code snippet.** The import statement is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n\n- **No significant errors detected.**  \n- The reasoning is consistent and thorough, correctly identifying the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n\n**Confidence:**  \n- All reports have high confidence (1 or 0.9), which is justified.\n\n**Obfuscated:**  \n- All 0, correct.\n\n**Malware:**  \n- All 0, correct.\n\n**SecurityRisk:**  \n- All 0, correct.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- No score adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- Since all reports assign a risk of 0, and the code is just an import statement, this is appropriate.\n- No evidence suggests any security concern, so higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct given the code snippet.\n- No malicious behavior is indicated or implied.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:\n\n- The reports assume the import is benign because it is a straightforward import statement.\n- This is reasonable; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable ratings.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided reports and code snippet:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Considering all factors:**\n\n- The code is a simple, standard import statement.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security issues.\n- The context is minimal, but nothing suspicious is evident.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No further action needed; the code is safe.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code snippet is a benign import statement with no security concerns. All scores should remain at zero, reflecting no malware, obfuscation, or risk.",
