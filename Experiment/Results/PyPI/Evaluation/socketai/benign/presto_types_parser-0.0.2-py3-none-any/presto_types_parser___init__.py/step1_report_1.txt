  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths present; import statement alone does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statement with no suspicious patterns, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement, which is a standard practice in Python for including external functions or modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. As it is a simple import, it poses minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
