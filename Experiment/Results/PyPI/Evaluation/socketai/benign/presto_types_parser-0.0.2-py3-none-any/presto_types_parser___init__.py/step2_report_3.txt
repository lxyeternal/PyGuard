  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\nThe code snippets are all simple import statements:\n\n```python\nfrom presto_types_parser.src.row_parser_builder import build_row_parser\n```\n\nNo additional code, data handling, or runtime behavior is shown. The import statements are straightforward and standard.\n\n**Step 2: Check for errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement.\n- They note that no data flows, sinks, or anomalies are present.\n- They consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\nNo logical errors or inconsistencies are evident in the reports.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), which seems appropriate given the minimal code.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation.\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Security risk scores are 0, which is reasonable for such minimal code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any higher risk scores**\n\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature, no risk scores need to be elevated.\n- The only point to consider is the import from a potentially third-party package: \"presto_types_parser\". However, importing a module alone does not imply malicious intent unless the package itself is compromised.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge claims based on assumptions**\n\n- The reports assume the package is legitimate. Without further context (e.g., package source, integrity checks), there's a minimal risk, but not enough evidence to assign a higher risk score.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns, are present.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure consistency of scores**\n\n- All scores are consistent with the minimal, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — import statements alone are low risk; unless the package is malicious, which cannot be determined from this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is a benign import statement.\n- The reports are accurate in their analysis.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- The high confidence levels are justified given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the analysis.",
