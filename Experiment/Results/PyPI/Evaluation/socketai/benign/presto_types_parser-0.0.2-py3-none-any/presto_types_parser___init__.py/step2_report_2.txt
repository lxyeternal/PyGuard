  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\nfrom presto_types_parser.src.row_parser_builder import build_row_parser\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. Presence of Issues in the Code\n- **Is the reported code present?**  \n  Yes, all reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement importing `build_row_parser` from a specific module path.\n\n- **Are there any errors or flaws?**  \n  No, the import statement appears syntactically correct and standard.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Logical, Reasoning, or Summary Flaws\n- **Are the reports accurate in their reasoning?**  \n  Yes, all reports conclude that this is a benign, straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. They correctly note that no data flow, execution, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n- **Any overstatements or assumptions?**  \n  No, the reports are cautious and appropriate, emphasizing the lack of anomalies or malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Score Justifications\n- **Obfuscated score (0 in all reports):**  \n  Correct, there's no obfuscation in the code.\n\n- **Malware score (all 0):**  \n  Correct, the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior based solely on this import.\n\n- **Security risk score (all 0):**  \n  Appropriate, as an import statement alone does not pose a security risk.\n\n- **Confidence levels:**  \n  High confidence (1 or 0.9) is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Risk and Malware Score Analysis\n- **Should the scores be adjusted?**  \n  No, the scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n- **Is there any reason to assign a higher risk or malware score?**  \n  No, unless additional context suggests malicious intent, which isn't provided here.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent based solely on an import statement.\n- Importing from `presto_types_parser.src.row_parser_builder` could, in theory, be suspicious if the package is malicious or compromised, but there's no evidence here.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Final Assessment and Recommendations\n- **Overall, the code is benign.**  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0\n\n- **Estimated scores (my opinion):**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's simplicity. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways consider additional context or code that uses this import to fully assess security risks, but based solely on this snippet, it is safe.",
