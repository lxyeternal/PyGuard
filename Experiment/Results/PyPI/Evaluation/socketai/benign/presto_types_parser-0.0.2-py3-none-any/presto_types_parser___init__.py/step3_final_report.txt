  "purpose": "Evaluate the provided code snippet for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on supply chain security concerns related to the import statement.",
  "sources": "The import statement `from presto_types_parser.src.row_parser_builder import build_row_parser`",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows if the imported function is used maliciously, or if the package source is compromised (not shown in snippet).",
  "flows": "Importing the module, which could lead to execution if the imported function is invoked elsewhere, but no such usage is present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing `build_row_parser` from a specific module path within `presto_types_parser`. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the snippet. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. Given the minimal context, the import appears standard, and there is no evidence to suggest malicious intent or security issues. The package source's trustworthiness cannot be assessed from this snippet alone, but the code itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious or security concerns. All reports and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
