  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their validity, scores, and any inconsistencies.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same import statement: `from presto_types_parser.src.row_parser_builder import build_row_parser`.\n- They uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The scores assigned are predominantly 0 for malware and security risk, with high confidence levels (mostly 1).\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present in the code:\n\n**Issue presence:**  \n- The code is a simple import statement. No actual code execution, data handling, or network activity is visible.  \n- **No issues are present** based solely on this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n\n- **Reasoning:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that an import statement alone is unlikely to be malicious or risky.  \n  They do not overstate potential issues or assume vulnerabilities without evidence.\n\n- **Potential oversight:**  \n  While the reports mention that importing from internal directories or third-party packages can sometimes be suspicious, they correctly note that in this context, it appears standard.\n\n- **No flawed reasoning detected.**\n\n---\n\n### Score assessments:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which aligns with the minimal risk posed by an import statement.\n\n**However,** given the context, I would **not** assign a security risk score higher than 0 unless there is additional context indicating malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for any higher risk or malware scores:\n\n- **Risk score > 0.5:**  \n  Not justified here. Importing a module alone, especially from a known package, does not constitute a security risk unless the package is malicious or compromised, which cannot be inferred from this snippet.\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  No evidence of malicious activity, so 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n\n- The reports assume the package is legitimate and the import is benign.  \n- Without additional context (e.g., package integrity, source, or runtime behavior), this assumption is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n**Estimated scores based on this analysis:**\n\n| malware | obfuscated | securityRisk |\n|---------|--------------|----------------|\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0**          |\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.  \n- The import statement is standard and does not pose any immediate threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is benign.\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- No evidence suggests malware or obfuscation.\n- The risk remains at zero.\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways consider additional context, such as package trustworthiness, runtime behavior, and source integrity, before making definitive security judgments.",
