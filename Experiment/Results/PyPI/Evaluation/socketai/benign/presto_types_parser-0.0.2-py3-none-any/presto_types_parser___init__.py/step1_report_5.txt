  "purpose": "Importing the 'build_row_parser' function from the 'presto_types_parser.src.row_parser_builder' module, likely for parsing or handling data rows.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a third-party package 'presto_types_parser' (from its internal module 'src.row_parser_builder').",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow present in this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Importing from internal or src directories can sometimes be suspicious if used improperly, but in this context, it appears to be standard practice for module access. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement, which is a standard way to include functions or classes from external modules or packages. There is no dynamic execution, data processing, or handling of untrusted input shown. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security issues are evident from this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single import statement, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a typical import of a function from an external package for use in data parsing or processing tasks.",
