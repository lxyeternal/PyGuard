  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a simple import statement with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that an import statement alone is benign. The confidence is high, and no issues are present.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, a straightforward import from a third-party package, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the import appears standard. The slightly lower confidence (0.9) is reasonable given the minimal context, but no evidence suggests any malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; a simple import statement with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous reports. The code is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar benign import, referencing an external package.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, no signs of malicious activity. The import path is typical for modular codebases.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Import from an internal or src directory; considered standard practice.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nWhile importing from internal directories can sometimes be suspicious if used maliciously, in this context, it appears legitimate. The report correctly states no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Code Presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is just an import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, with high confidence.\n- **Potential Risks:** No evidence suggests any risk or malware in these snippets.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- Based on the provided code snippets and reports, **the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all remain at 0**.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate given the minimal context.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with the actual code, which is benign. No further action or concern is warranted here.",
