{
  "purpose": "Importing a function 'build_row_parser' from the 'presto_types_parser.src.row_parser_builder' module, likely for constructing or parsing data rows.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a third-party package 'presto_types_parser' located in 'src' directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows identified; this is an import statement with no execution or data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing evident; only an import statement present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The import appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement importing 'build_row_parser' from a package path. There is no execution, data processing, or other logic. The import path suggests dependency on an external package, but this alone is not suspicious. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or malicious payloads are present. The code is minimal and standard in structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate import of a function from an open-source package, with no signs of tampering or malicious intent.",
