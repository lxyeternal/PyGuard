  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling row parsing errors.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output processes involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, secrets, or suspicious constructs; simple class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class named RowParsingException that inherits from Python's built-in Exception class. It contains no additional logic, data, or behavior. There are no input sources, data flows, or sinks. The code is straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions in Python. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard definition of a custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks.",
