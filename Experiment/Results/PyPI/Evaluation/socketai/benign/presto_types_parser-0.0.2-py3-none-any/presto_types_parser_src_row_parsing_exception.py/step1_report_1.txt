  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named RowParsingException for handling specific parsing errors.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; class definition does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; the code only defines an exception class.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only declares an exception class without any execution or data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class definition that inherits from Exception, used to create a custom exception type. It contains no executable logic, input/output operations, or data handling. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks present in this minimal code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard class definition for a custom exception with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
