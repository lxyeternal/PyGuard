  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling specific row parsing errors.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources; the code is a class definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the class is a simple exception definition with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward class with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single class inheriting from Exception with no additional logic. It is minimal, clear, and standard for custom exceptions. No input, output, or external interactions are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions, contain obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores are justified. No further action or modification is necessary.",
