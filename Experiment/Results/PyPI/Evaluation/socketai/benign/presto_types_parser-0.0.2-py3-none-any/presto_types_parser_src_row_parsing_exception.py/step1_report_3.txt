  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, minimal, and standard; no unusual patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a custom exception class definition inheriting from Exception, with no additional logic or data handling. It appears to serve as a specific error type for parsing operations. No input, output, or data processing occurs. The code is simple and does not contain obfuscated features, malicious constructs, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard Python class definition for an exception. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
