  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Indicators**  \nAll reports consistently identify the code as a simple class definition inheriting from Exception, with no executable logic, input/output operations, or data handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns. The code is minimal and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \nNo errors or flaws are evident. The class is straightforward and correctly implemented for its purpose.\n\n3. **Score Justification**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No malicious behavior is indicated or implied.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable class definition.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**  \nSince the code is purely a class definition with no execution, data flow, or external interactions, any claim suggesting vulnerabilities or malicious intent would be unfounded. The reports correctly dismiss such concerns.\n\n5. **Score Reasonableness and Adjustments**  \nThe scores seem reasonable and consistent across all reports. Given the code's simplicity, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**  \n- The code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence level is high (1), as all reports agree.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**  \n- Keep all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- Confirm that the code remains a simple class definition with no hidden behavior.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code snippet is a benign, standard custom exception class with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and no changes are needed.",
