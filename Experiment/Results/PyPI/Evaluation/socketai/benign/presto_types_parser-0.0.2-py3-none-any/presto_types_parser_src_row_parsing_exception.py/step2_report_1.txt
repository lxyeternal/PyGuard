  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a class definition for `RowParsingException` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - The actual code snippet confirms this: `class RowParsingException(Exception): pass`\n   - There are no other operations, data handling, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - No issues are present in the code.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is a simple, standard class definition with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - They correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n4. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0 for malware and security risk, and the code is a straightforward class definition, higher scores are unjustified.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Malware Score Analysis:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, which is correct.\n   - The code contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n\n7. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are evident.\n\n8. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Recommendation:\n\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the provided scores. The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a standard, harmless class definition used for exception handling, common in Python projects.",
