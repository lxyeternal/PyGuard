  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their assessments, as well as the scoring.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception inheriting from `Exception`. There are no executable logic, input/output, or data flow concerns. No issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard. No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate since the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, correctly indicating no malicious behavior.  \n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is purely a class definition with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions, the risk score should remain at 0. The reports' scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports correctly identify no malware or malicious intent. The malware scores are appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nNo report makes unwarranted assumptions; all are cautious and accurate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct, no security concern)\n\n### My own estimate after review:\n\nGiven the uniformity and correctness of the reports, I concur with their assessments. The code is a benign class definition with no security issues.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code poses no security risk.",
