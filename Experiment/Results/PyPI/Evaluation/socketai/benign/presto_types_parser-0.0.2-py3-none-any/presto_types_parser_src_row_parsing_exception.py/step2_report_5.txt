  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code snippets carefully.\n\n1. Code Content Confirmation:\n- All reports describe a class definition: class RowParsingException(Exception): pass\n- The code is straightforward, defining a custom exception inheriting from Exception.\n- No executable logic, data input/output, or external interactions are present.\n- The code is minimal and standard for custom exception classes in Python.\n\n2. Presence of Issues:\n- The code snippets do not contain any errors, flaws, or malicious behavior.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- No data flows, input sources, or sinks are involved.\n\n3. Evaluation of Scores:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which is appropriate.\n- Confidence scores are high (1), reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n- The reasoning in all reports is consistent and accurate.\n\n4. Justification of Risk Scores:\n- Since the code is merely a class definition with no executable or malicious components, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted.\n- Malware score is correctly zero; no malicious activity is indicated.\n- Obfuscated score is zero; no obfuscation is present.\n- Security risk is zero; the code does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n5. Critical Evaluation:\n- No claims in the reports are based on assumptions; all observations are accurate.\n- The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- The scores align with the code's nature.\n\n6. Final Estimation:\n- Given the analysis, I agree with the provided scores.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at 0.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, standard class definition for a custom exception.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The scoring in all reports is appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' assessments.**",
