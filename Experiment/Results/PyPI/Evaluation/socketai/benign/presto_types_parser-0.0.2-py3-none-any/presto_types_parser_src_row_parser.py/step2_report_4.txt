  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall Code Summary:**\n- The code defines a class `PrestoRowParser` that initializes with a list of cell processing functions.\n- The `process_row` method validates row length, raises an exception if mismatched, and applies each processing function to the corresponding cell.\n- The code imports a custom exception class, `RowParsingException`.\n- No external side effects, network calls, or malicious code are present.\n- The processing functions are externally provided, which is standard for flexible data transformation.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly describes the code as a data parser with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score seems appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Also correctly identifies the code as a data parser with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Justification:** No security issues; the risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to above; straightforward data processing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Justification:** No issues; the code is safe.\n- **Verdict:** Scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, a standard data parser with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) perhaps due to external functions, but since no malicious activity is evident, this is acceptable.\n- **Verdict:** Scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as others; standard row processing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Justification:** No security issues.\n- **Verdict:** Scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0 or 0.2. The slight risk score (0.2) in some reports seems to reflect potential concerns about external functions, but given the code snippet, this is not a security risk—just a standard practice.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code is a typical data parsing utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The risk scores of 0 or 0.2 are reasonable, given the context.\n- No evidence suggests the code is malicious or intentionally obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (safe, standard data processing)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code's actual behavior. The slight variation in risk scores (0.2) is acceptable but could be standardized to 0, considering no security concerns are present.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes to the scores are necessary. The code is benign, and the reports' assessments are accurate.",
