{
  "purpose": "To parse rows of data using a list of cell processing functions, validating row length, and handling parsing exceptions.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'row_raw_data' in process_row method, which is data to be parsed.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks, external network communication, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'row_raw_data' into the process_row method, through enumeration over 'root_cell_processors', and into 'process_raw_cell' functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard control flow and exception handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a parser class that validates row length and processes each cell with provided functions. It raises a custom exception if data length mismatches. The functions are passed in at initialization and are applied to each cell in sequence. No suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns are evident. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical data parsing patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs data parsing with validation and exception handling without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its intended purpose.",
