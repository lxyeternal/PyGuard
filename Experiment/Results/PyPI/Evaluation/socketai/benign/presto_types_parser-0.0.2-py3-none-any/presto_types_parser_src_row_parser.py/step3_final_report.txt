  "purpose": "A data parser class that processes rows by applying user-defined functions to each cell, with validation for row length.",
  "sources": "row_raw_data input parameter in process_row method, external functions in root_cell_processors",
  "sinks": "application of process_raw_cell functions to row data; no direct sinks within this code",
  "flows": "row_raw_data -> process_raw_cell functions applied to each cell, with validation step before processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward validation and processing, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for parsing data rows, validating row length, and applying external processing functions to each cell. It raises a custom exception on length mismatch. The code does not perform network, file, or system operations, nor does it contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The external functions could be malicious if misused, but this is outside the scope of this snippet. The implementation is standard and secure, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data parsing utility with no inherent malicious behavior. The low malware score (0), no obfuscation (0), and minimal security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate. External functions could pose risks if malicious, but within this code, it is safe.",
