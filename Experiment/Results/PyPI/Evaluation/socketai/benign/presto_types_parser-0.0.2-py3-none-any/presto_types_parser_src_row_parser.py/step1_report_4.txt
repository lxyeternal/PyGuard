  "purpose": "Parse and process rows of data using a list of cell processing functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'row_raw_data' in the 'process_row' method.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'process_raw_cell' on each element of 'row_raw_data'.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from 'row_raw_data' into 'process_raw_cell' functions via enumeration in 'process_row'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code relies on external 'process_raw_cell' functions, which could be a concern if malicious, but not inherently so.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes with a list of cell processing functions and processes a data row by applying each function to corresponding cell data. It raises an exception if row length mismatches. No external data fetching, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The code does not include malicious payloads or backdoors. It simply processes data, with potential risk dependent on the 'process_raw_cell' functions, which are external. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward data processing class with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious data parsing utility that processes input rows with external functions. No malware or security risks are evident within this code segment.",
