{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class PrestoRowParser for parsing rows of data using provided cell processing functions, likely for data transformation or validation.",
  "sources": "Input data provided via the process_row method as row_raw_data parameter.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; the code does not write to files, send data over network, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from process_row into cell processing functions, then outputs a tuple of processed values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears straightforward and typical for data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a custom exception class and defines a parser class with initialization, equality comparison, and row processing methods. The process_row method checks row length, raises an exception if mismatched, and applies a list of processing functions to each cell. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious logic. The use of cell processors suggests flexible data transformation, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data parsing class without malicious behavior or security risks. It performs input validation and applies user-defined functions to data rows, which is common in ETL processes.",
