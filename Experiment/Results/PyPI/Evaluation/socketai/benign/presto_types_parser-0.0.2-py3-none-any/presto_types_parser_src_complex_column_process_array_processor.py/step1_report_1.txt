{
  "purpose": "The function appears to generate a new function that processes raw cell data by applying an inner processing function to each value in a collection.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input parameter 'raw_cell' and the 'process_inner_raw_cell' function passed as an argument.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file, or database operations are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Input 'raw_cell' flows through the conditional check and, if not None, is processed by 'process_inner_raw_cell' for each value, generating a list.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no unusual language features. No external dependencies or side effects are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a higher-order function that returns a processing function. The inner function checks for None input, then applies a provided processing function to each element of 'raw_cell'. It is a simple, common pattern for data processing. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks are evident. The code does not perform any data leaks, network access, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for data processing, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and typical for data transformation tasks.",
