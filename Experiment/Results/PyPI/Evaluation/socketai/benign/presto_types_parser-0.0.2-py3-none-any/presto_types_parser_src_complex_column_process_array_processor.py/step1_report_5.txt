{
  "purpose": "The code defines a higher-order function that creates a processor for raw cell data, applying a given processing function to each value in a list.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'raw_cell', which is expected to be a list or None.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks where untrusted data leads to security vulnerabilities; no external output or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input 'raw_cell' through the list comprehension that applies 'process_inner_raw_cell' to each element, then returns the processed list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The function creates a nested function 'process_raw_cell' which checks if 'raw_cell' is None. If not, it applies 'process_inner_raw_cell' to each element of 'raw_cell' and returns the list of results. The structure is standard for higher-order functions. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security issues. The code's purpose appears to be data processing, with no external data leaks or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward higher-order function for processing list data. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and well-structured.",
