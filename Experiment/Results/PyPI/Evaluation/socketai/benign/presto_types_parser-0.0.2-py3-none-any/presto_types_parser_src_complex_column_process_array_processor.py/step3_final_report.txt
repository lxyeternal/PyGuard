  "purpose": "A higher-order function that creates a processing function to apply a given function to each element of a list-like input, handling None inputs gracefully.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'raw_cell' which is expected to be a list or None.",
  "sinks": "Application of 'process_inner_raw_cell' to each element; no external sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input 'raw_cell' flows through a None check, then each element is processed by 'process_inner_raw_cell' and collected into a list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple higher-order function that returns a processor applying a provided function to each element of a list, with a check for None inputs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware scores are 0, obfuscated scores are 0, and security risk scores are minimal (~0 or 0.1), which are appropriate given the code's simplicity. Minor overestimation of risk in one report (0.1) is acceptable but could be lowered to 0. Overall, the code is a safe utility function for data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
