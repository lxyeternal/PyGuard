{
  "purpose": "Define a higher-order function that creates a processing function to transform raw cell data using an inner processing function.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'raw_cell' which is iterated over if not None.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks in this code; no data leaks or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'raw_cell' is checked for None, then each element within it is processed by 'process_inner_raw_cell'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that returns another function to process a list-like input. It handles None input gracefully. It applies a provided inner processing function to each element of the input. There are no external calls, no data leaks, and no suspicious constructs. The structure appears clean and purposeful. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign higher-order function that processes list data via a provided callback. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
