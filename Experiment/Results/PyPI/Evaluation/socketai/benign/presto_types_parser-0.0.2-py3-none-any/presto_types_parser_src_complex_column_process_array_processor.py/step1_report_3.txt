{
  "purpose": "A higher-order function designed to process raw cell data by applying an inner processing function to each element.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'raw_cell', which is expected to be an iterable (such as a list or similar).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as there are no external outputs, file operations, network calls, or untrusted data handling within this code.",
  "flows": "Input 'raw_cell' flows into the generator expression where 'process_inner_raw_cell' is applied to each element, resulting in a list of processed values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and typical of functional programming patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'new_process_raw_cell_function' that takes a function 'process_inner_raw_cell' as an argument and returns another function 'process_raw_cell'. When called, 'process_raw_cell' processes a list-like input 'raw_cell' by applying 'process_inner_raw_cell' to each element, returning a list of results. The logic is simple, with no network access, file I/O, or other side effects. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious data handling, or malicious intent within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign higher-order processing function intended to process a list of data elements using a provided processing function. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this isolated snippet.",
