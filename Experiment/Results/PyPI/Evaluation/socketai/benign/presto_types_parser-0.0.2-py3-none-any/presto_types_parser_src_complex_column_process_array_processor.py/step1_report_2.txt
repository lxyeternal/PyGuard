{
  "purpose": "The function `new_process_raw_cell_function` creates a new function that processes a list of raw cell values using a provided inner processing function.",
  "sources": "The function reads input through the `raw_cell` parameter, which is expected to be iterable, and the `process_inner_raw_cell` function, which is called on each element of `raw_cell`.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, no external data writes, network connections, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from `raw_cell` into the `for value in raw_cell` loop, where each `value` is processed by `process_inner_raw_cell`.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are observed. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a higher-order function that returns a processing function. It checks for `None` input, then processes each element of the input list using a provided function. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code appears to be standard functional programming practice for processing list data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and safe, serving as a wrapper to process list items with a given function. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this code fragment.",
