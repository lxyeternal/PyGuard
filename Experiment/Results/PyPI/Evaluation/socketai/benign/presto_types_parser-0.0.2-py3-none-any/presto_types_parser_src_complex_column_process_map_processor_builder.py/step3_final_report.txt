  "purpose": "Extracts type signatures from column type signature data and builds a map processor using an external function.",
  "sources": "column_type_signature arguments (nested dictionaries), external function new_map_process_function",
  "sinks": "External function new_map_process_function (potentially processing data), no direct data leaks or malicious actions within this code",
  "flows": "Retrieve argument 1 and 2 from column_type_signature -> pass processed data to new_map_process_function",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns; relies on external function behavior",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple nested dictionary access to extract type signatures and passes them to an external processing function. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The main external dependency's behavior is unknown but assumed safe. Input validation is absent, which could cause runtime errors but does not imply malicious intent. The code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators justify low malware and obfuscation scores. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting reliance on external code and potential input structure issues. Overall, the code appears benign, with minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data extraction and processing setup with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The external dependency should be reviewed separately, but within this fragment, the security risk is minimal. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
