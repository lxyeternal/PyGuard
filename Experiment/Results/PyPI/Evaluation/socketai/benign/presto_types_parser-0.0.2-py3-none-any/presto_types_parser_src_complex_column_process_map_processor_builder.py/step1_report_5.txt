{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be processing type signatures for a data processing task, specifically related to map data structures, likely within a larger data parsing or transformation system.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the parameter 'column_type_signature', specifically accessing nested dictionaries and lists to extract type information.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'new_map_process_function', which is imported from an external library, passing in processed data; potential risk depends on the implementation of this external function.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'column_type_signature' into extraction functions, then into 'new_map_process_function' as processed arguments.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies heavily on nested get() calls without checks for missing keys, which may cause runtime errors but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it extracts specific parts of a type signature and uses those to create a new map processor. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The external dependency 'new_map_process_function' could be a vector if malicious, but without its implementation, it cannot be assessed. The code assumes the structure of 'column_type_signature' is correct, which might lead to errors if malformed, but this alone does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform standard data processing with no evident malicious intent. It functions as part of a larger data processing pipeline, with no suspicious behaviors or security risks detected based solely on this snippet.",
