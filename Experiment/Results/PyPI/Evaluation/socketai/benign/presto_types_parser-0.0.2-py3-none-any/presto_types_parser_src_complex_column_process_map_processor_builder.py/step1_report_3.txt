{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be processing column type signatures to generate processing functions, likely for handling data structures like maps within a data processing or parsing context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'column_type_signature' input parameter, specifically accessing nested dictionary keys such as 'arguments' and 'value'.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'new_map_process_function' with processed arguments, which is a function imported from an external source; the code itself does not directly execute external commands or write data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'column_type_signature' through helper functions '_extract_key_primitive_type' and 'extract_inner_type_signatures' to the 'build_map_processor' function, which then passes processed values to 'new_map_process_function'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code performs straightforward data extraction and function invocation. The imported function 'new_map_process_function' is external, so its behavior cannot be assessed here, but its use appears legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code processes nested dictionary structures to extract type signatures and build processing functions, likely for schema or data type handling in a larger data pipeline. It uses simple dictionary accessors without eval, exec, or other dangerous constructs. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions are small and focused. The external import 'new_map_process_function' is not inherently suspicious but should be verified separately for security. Overall, the code appears to be a standard part of a data processing module, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data processing utility for extracting type signatures and constructing map processors. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior. The security risk is low, assuming 'new_map_process_function' is safe. No signs of obfuscation or malicious activity are present.",
