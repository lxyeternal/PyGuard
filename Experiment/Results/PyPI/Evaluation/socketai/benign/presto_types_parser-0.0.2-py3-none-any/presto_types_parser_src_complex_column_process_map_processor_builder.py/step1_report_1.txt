{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process and transform data structures related to 'column type signatures' in a data processing context, specifically building map processors and extracting type signatures.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'column_type_signature' parameter, accessing nested dictionaries and lists to extract specific values.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'new_map_process_function', passing processed data, which could be a sink if the function executes or manipulates data based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'column_type_signature' into extraction functions, then into 'new_map_process_function', potentially executing or transforming data based on input structure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code relies on external function 'new_map_process_function' without inspecting its behavior. No obfuscated or unusual language features are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from an external module and defines three functions: 'extract_inner_type_signatures', 'build_map_processor', and '_extract_key_primitive_type'. These functions parse nested dictionary structures to extract specific type information. There are no evident malicious behaviors such as network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The reliance on an external function 'new_map_process_function' could be a concern if that function contains malicious code, but from this code alone, there is no indication of malicious intent. The code operates on expected data structures and performs straightforward data extraction and processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard data extraction and processing based on nested dictionary inputs. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or suspicious activities are apparent within this fragment. It appears to be a typical utility module for handling column type signatures without security risks or malware indicators.",
