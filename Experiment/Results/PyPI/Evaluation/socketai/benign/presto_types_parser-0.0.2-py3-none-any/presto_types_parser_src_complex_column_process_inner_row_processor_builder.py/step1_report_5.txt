{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process and extract information from data type signatures related to the Presto query engine, particularly focusing on nested column structures.",
  "sources": "Data sources include 'column_type_signature' parameters passed into various functions, which contain type and argument information for processing.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily manipulates data structures and returns processed lists; it does not perform external actions or output untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'column_type_signature' flows through functions like '_extract_inner_column_names' and '_extract_inner_column_elements', ultimately producing lists of column names or type signatures.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies heavily on 'get' method calls without validation of the data structure's integrity, but this is typical for data parsing. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically extracts nested information from type signature dictionaries, with careful handling of legacy ('literalArguments') and current ('typeArguments') formats. There are no network calls, system modifications, or sensitive data handling observed. The functions serve purely as data transformers. No suspicious logic or malicious intent is evident; the code is straightforward and standard for schema processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard parsing and extraction of nested type signatures with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical data processing module with no suspicious elements.",
