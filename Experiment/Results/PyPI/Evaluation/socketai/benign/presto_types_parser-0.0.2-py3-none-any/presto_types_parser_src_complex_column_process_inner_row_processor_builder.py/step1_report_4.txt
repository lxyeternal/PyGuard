{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process and extract information from 'column_type_signature' data structures, likely related to parsing or handling type signatures in a data processing context, possibly within a Presto or similar environment.",
  "sources": "Reads from the input parameter 'column_type_signature' in multiple functions, including key lookups such as 'typeArguments', 'literalArguments', 'arguments', and nested dictionary accesses.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks are present in the code; it does not write data to external systems, execute commands, or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The code primarily reads structured data from 'column_type_signature' and its nested components to produce lists of inner column names or type signatures. There are no evident data flows that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not perform any dangerous operations, such as executing code, handling untrusted input unsafely, or accessing sensitive data. It mainly manipulates data structures. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The code structure is straightforward and does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code safely processes structured data to extract nested information, with standard checks for dictionary keys and fallback mechanisms for missing data. It does not handle external input/output beyond reading from provided data structures, nor does it invoke external commands or perform network operations. The absence of any system modification, data exfiltration, or malicious code strongly indicates benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data extraction utility designed to parse nested type signature structures. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. The code appears safe and has no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
