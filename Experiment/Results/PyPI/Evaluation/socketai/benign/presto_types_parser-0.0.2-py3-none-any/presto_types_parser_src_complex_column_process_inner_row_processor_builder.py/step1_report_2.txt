{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to process and extract information from column type signatures, particularly for nested or complex column structures in a data processing context.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the input parameter 'column_type_signature' in various functions, notably in 'extract_inner_type_signatures', '_extract_inner_column_names', '_extract_inner_column_names_from_old_type_signature', '_extract_inner_column_name', and '_extract_inner_column_elements'.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions. The code primarily manipulates data structures in memory.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input 'column_type_signature' through various extraction functions, ultimately producing lists of column names and type signatures. No untrusted external data flows into insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with standard data processing; no suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or hardcoded credentials are evident. There are no signs of malicious backdoors or covert data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically extracts column names and type signatures from a nested data structure, handling both modern and older schema formats. It uses clear, predictable logic with no external system calls or insecure practices. The functions mainly perform list comprehensions and dictionary lookups, consistent with safe data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of string concatenation for default field names is benign. Overall, the code appears to be a utility module for schema parsing with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign schema parsing utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs data extraction and transformation safely, with no suspicious patterns or activities.",
