{
  "purpose": "This code processes and extracts information from nested column type signatures, likely for handling complex data types in a data processing system.",
  "sources": "Reads from input parameters such as 'column_type_signature' and its nested fields like 'typeArguments', 'literalArguments', and 'arguments'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or system compromise; mainly data extraction and processing functions.",
  "flows": "Extracts data from 'column_type_signature' → processes nested fields → returns lists of column names or type signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to perform standard data parsing without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from an external module and defines several helper functions to extract column names and type signatures from nested data structures. It includes fallback mechanisms for older data formats and handles missing field names by generating default names. The functions perform safe, standard dictionary and list operations without executing untrusted input or performing insecure actions. No network access, system modification, or malicious payloads are present. All data processing appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data extraction utility for processing nested type signatures. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The overall structure and logic are typical for such data handling tasks.",
