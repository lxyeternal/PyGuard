  "purpose": "Utility functions for extracting nested column names and type signatures from schema definitions, supporting multiple data formats.",
  "sources": "column_type_signature dictionary, specifically keys like 'typeArguments', 'literalArguments', 'arguments', and nested 'fieldName' and 'typeSignature' fields.",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs data parsing without external outputs or side effects.",
  "flows": "Reads from 'column_type_signature' -> processes keys like 'typeArguments' or 'literalArguments' -> extracts nested 'typeSignature' or 'fieldName' -> returns lists of names or signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward data extraction with fallback mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code safely accesses nested dictionaries, handles multiple schema formats, and constructs lists of column names and type signatures. It uses standard Python idioms such as 'get()' and list comprehensions, with fallback functions for legacy formats. No external calls, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. The functions are designed for schema parsing, with no evident security vulnerabilities or obfuscation. The logic is clear, robust, and aligns with typical data processing utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for extracting schema information. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
