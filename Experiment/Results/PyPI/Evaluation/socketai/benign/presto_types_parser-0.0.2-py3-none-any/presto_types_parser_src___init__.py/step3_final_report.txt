  "sources": "Use of eval/exec, environment variables, external inputs, system commands, data handling functions.",
  "sinks": "Console output, file system, network connections, environment variables, system commands.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or untrusted data flow into eval/exec or system calls, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted data, minimal comments, obfuscated variable names, lack of code clarity, suspicious dynamic execution functions.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets with eval/exec pose a potential security risk, especially if used with untrusted input, indicating possible malicious intent. Absence of hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads reduces certainty but warrants caution. Standard code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns shows low risk. Suspicious patterns are primarily in reports describing dynamic code execution, which could be exploited for malicious purposes. Overall, the threat level is moderate when eval/exec are involved without safeguards, but no concrete malicious activity is confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "The most significant concern is the use of eval/exec in some reports, which could lead to code injection if misused. Other reports show no signs of malicious behavior. Scores are generally appropriate; minor adjustments are recommended to better reflect suspicion levels, especially increasing the malware score in Report 2 from 0.2 to 0.3 and the security risk from 0.4 to 0.5 to account for potential risks associated with dynamic execution.",
