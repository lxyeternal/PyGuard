  "conclusion": "The most significant concern is the use of eval/exec in some reports, which could lead to code injection if misused. Other reports show no signs of malicious behavior. Scores are generally appropriate; minor adjustments are recommended to better reflect suspicion levels, especially increasing the malware score in Report 2 from 0.2 to 0.3 and the security risk from 0.4 to 0.5 to account for potential risks associated with dynamic execution."
