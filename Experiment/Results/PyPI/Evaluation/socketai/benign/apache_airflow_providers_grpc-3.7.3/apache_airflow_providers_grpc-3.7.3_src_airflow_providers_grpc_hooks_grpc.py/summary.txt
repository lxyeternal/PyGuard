  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of an Airflow gRPC hook with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. Minor security considerations relate to external control of credential file paths, which is a common operational pattern but should be managed properly. Overall, the code is safe and well-designed."
