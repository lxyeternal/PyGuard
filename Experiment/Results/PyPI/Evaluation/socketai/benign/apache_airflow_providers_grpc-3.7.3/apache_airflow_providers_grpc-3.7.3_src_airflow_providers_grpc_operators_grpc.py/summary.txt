  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard, and benign implementation of an Airflow gRPC operator. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The minimal security risk is due to the potential misuse of callbacks or data exposure, which is typical for such extensible components. Overall, the code is safe and the scores are appropriate."
