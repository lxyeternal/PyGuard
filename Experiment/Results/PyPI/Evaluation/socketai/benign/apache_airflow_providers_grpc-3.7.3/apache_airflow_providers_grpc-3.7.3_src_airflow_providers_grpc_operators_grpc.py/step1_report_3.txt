  "purpose": "Define a custom Airflow operator to make gRPC calls with configurable parameters and callbacks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as stub_class, call_func, grpc_conn_id, data, interceptors, custom_connection_func, response_callback",
  "sinks": "Responses from the gRPC call, response_callback execution, logging responses",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> _get_grpc_hook() -> hook.run() -> responses -> _handle_response() -> response_callback or logging",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code execution, no data leaks or network calls outside expected gRPC context. Use of potentially flexible user-defined callables, but no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a specialized Airflow operator for gRPC communication. It accepts various configuration inputs, including callables and interceptors, which are typical for flexible integrations. There are no indications of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network attacks. The functions and flow follow expected patterns for an operator that makes network calls. No obfuscation, suspicious imports, or dangerous code patterns are present. The use of user-provided callables for connection customization could be misused in a malicious context if the user supplies malicious functions, but this is outside the scope of the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured custom Airflow operator for gRPC communication without any malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on external user input for some functions, but this is typical for such operators and does not indicate malicious intent.",
