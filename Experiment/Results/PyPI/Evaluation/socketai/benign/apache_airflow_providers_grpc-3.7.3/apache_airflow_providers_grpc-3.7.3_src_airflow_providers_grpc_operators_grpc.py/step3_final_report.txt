  "purpose": "Defines an Airflow operator to perform gRPC calls with configurable parameters such as stub class, call function, data, interceptors, and callbacks.",
  "sources": "Parameters provided during initialization: stub_class, call_func, grpc_conn_id, data, interceptors, custom_connection_func, response_callback.",
  "sinks": "Responses from gRPC calls are logged or passed to user-defined callback functions, which could potentially expose sensitive data if responses contain secrets.",
  "flows": "Data flows from parameters into the gRPC hook, which executes the call; responses are then processed via logging or callbacks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. Use of user-supplied callables and interceptors is standard but could be misused if callbacks are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation of an Airflow operator for gRPC communication. It uses external parameters and callbacks for extensibility, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The response handling and logging are typical patterns. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The potential security concern lies in the misuse of callbacks or logging sensitive data, but this is a common risk in such extensible systems and not indicative of malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as no malicious code is present. The security risk score of 0.2 reflects minor potential misuse but no direct vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard, and benign implementation of an Airflow gRPC operator. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The minimal security risk is due to the potential misuse of callbacks or data exposure, which is typical for such extensible components. Overall, the code is safe and the scores are appropriate.",
