  "purpose": "This code is for managing package version compatibility and licensing information for an Apache Airflow provider package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version from an imported module (__version__ from airflow) and parses it using packaging.version.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which is a controlled exception message and not a security risk.",
  "flows": "The code reads airflow_version, parses it, compares it to a fixed version string, and raises an error if incompatible.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies. The code appears to be standard version checking and license comment headers. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information, performs version parsing, and enforces a version requirement via a RuntimeError. All operations are standard for package compatibility checks. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version compatibility check with license comments. It does not contain malicious code, malware, or security risks. The purpose is to ensure correct package usage.",
