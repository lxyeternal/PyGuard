  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward version check and license header for an Apache Airflow provider package. The code imports `airflow.__version__`, parses it, and raises a `RuntimeError` if the version is below 2.9.0. There are no indications of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or external data input/output beyond standard version parsing.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code performs standard compatibility validation. No suspicious network activity, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The license headers are standard and not suspicious.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:  \n   No errors or logical flaws are evident. The version comparison logic is correct, and the exception message is clear. The code is typical boilerplate for package validation.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1. Since the code only performs a version check and raises an exception, the security risk is minimal. The 0.1 score might be slightly overestimating, but it’s still very low.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns & Assumptions**:\n   - The code is auto-generated, which is common for package initialization scripts.\n   - The version check is standard practice.\n   - No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is benign, serving only to enforce version compatibility.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - The scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Estimation & Recommendations**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score**: **0** (the code performs a benign version check; no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThis code is a standard, auto-generated version validation script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate, and there are no security concerns based on the provided code.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- Confirmed: No malicious or obfuscated code.  \n- Scores are reasonable.  \n- No further action required.",
