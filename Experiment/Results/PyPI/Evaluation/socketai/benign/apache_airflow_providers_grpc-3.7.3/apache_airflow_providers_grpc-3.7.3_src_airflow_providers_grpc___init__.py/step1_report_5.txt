{
  "purpose": "The code is a generated initialization script for an Apache Airflow provider package, mainly performing version checks and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "It reads the Airflow version from the imported airflow.__version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "Potentially raises an exception if the Airflow version is incompatible; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves reading the airflow.__version__, parsing it, and raising an exception if conditions are met.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. The version check and import statements are standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the airflow version, compares it against a specified minimum version, and raises a RuntimeError if the installed version is below 2.9.0. It uses standard Python packaging and import practices. The code is boilerplate, automatically generated, with no external data inputs or dangerous operations. The overall structure is straightforward and consistent with typical package initialization scripts. No anomalies or malicious indicators found.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, auto-generated package initializer performing version validation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
