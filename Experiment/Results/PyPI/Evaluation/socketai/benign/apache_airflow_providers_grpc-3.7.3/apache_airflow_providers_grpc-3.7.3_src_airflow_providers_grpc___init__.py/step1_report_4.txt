{
  "purpose": "This code is a generated module for the Apache Airflow provider, primarily setting version information and checking compatibility based on the Airflow version.",
  "sources": "Reads environment and package version data: imports airflow version and packaging.version for version parsing.",
  "sinks": "Raises RuntimeError if the airflow version is below 2.9.0, potentially halting execution.",
  "flows": "Imports airflow version -> compares with hardcoded minimum version -> raises error if condition met.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; use of version parsing and a straightforward version check.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles version management for compatibility, importing necessary modules, and performing a comparison. It raises an error if the current Airflow version is below 2.9.0. No input from external sources, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious operations. The code is standard for ensuring compatibility and does not contain malicious or malicious-looking components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard generated compatibility check for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious activity. It simply verifies the Airflow version and raises an error if the environment does not meet requirements.",
