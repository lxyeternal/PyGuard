  "purpose": "This code initializes metadata and version checks for an Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring compatibility with a specific Airflow version.",
  "sources": "Reads the Airflow version from the imported airflow.__version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "Raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0.",
  "flows": "Code flow from version comparison to potential exception raising based on version mismatch.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard version parsing and validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the necessary modules and defines package metadata. It checks the current Airflow version against a minimum required version (2.9.0). If the current version is below 2.9.0, it raises a RuntimeError with a clear message. The code appears to be standard version validation logic without any obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious data handling. The comments clarify that this is automatically generated code, and the version check is a common compatibility safeguard.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard version validation for package compatibility. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is straightforward and appears safe.",
