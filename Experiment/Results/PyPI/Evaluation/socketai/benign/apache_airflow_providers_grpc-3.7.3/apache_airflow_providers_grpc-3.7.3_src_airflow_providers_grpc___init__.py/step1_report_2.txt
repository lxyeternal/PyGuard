{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an auto-generated package metadata and version validation script for an Apache Airflow provider plugin.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version of the installed airflow package and the current package version for validation.",
  "sinks": "The version comparison and potential RuntimeError raising could affect package compatibility, but do not directly lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code sources airflow version, compares it with a hardcoded minimum version, and may raise an exception based on the comparison.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a version check and exception raising, which is normal; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated Python script for validating package compatibility with Apache Airflow. It imports version info, compares the current airflow version against a minimum supported version, and raises an exception if the version is insufficient. The code uses straightforward version parsing and comparison, with no external data inputs or outputs, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated elements. It appears to be purely for validation purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware; the code serves a legitimate configuration purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe, and non-malicious version validation routine for an Apache Airflow provider package. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
