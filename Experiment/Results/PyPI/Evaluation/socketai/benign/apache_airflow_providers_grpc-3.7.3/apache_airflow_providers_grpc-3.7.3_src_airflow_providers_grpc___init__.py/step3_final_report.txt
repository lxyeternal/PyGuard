{
  "purpose": "This code performs a version check for the Apache Airflow package, ensuring the installed version meets the minimum required version (2.9.0). It also contains licensing information and comments indicating it is auto-generated.",
  "sources": "Reads the current Airflow version from the airflow.__version__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "Raises a RuntimeError if the version is below 2.9.0, which halts execution; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Source: airflow.__version__ -> Version parsing -> Conditional check -> Potential sink: RuntimeError raised.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, auto-generated, with standard license headers and no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard version validation script that imports the current Airflow version, parses it using packaging.version, and raises an exception if the version is below 2.9.0. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. The logic is clear and typical for compatibility enforcement. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The license comments are standard and do not indicate any security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk near 0) are accurate and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and performs a version check without any malicious intent or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation are correct, and the slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report can be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is safe and non-malicious.",
