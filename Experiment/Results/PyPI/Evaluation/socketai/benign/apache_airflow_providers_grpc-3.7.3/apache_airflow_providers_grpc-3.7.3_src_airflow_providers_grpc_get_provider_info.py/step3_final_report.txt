  "purpose": "Provides static package metadata for apache-airflow-providers-grpc, including versions, dependencies, and related info.",
  "sources": "Static data within the function return statement.",
  "sinks": "No external data input or output; static data only.",
  "flows": "None; data is hardcoded and not processed dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is auto-generated boilerplate with no suspicious features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static function returning package metadata. It contains no user input, external data fetching, dynamic code execution, or network operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious instructions are present. The code is purely informational and auto-generated, with a license header indicating standard boilerplate. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, reflecting its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static package metadata with no malicious or suspicious features. All reports correctly identify this, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
