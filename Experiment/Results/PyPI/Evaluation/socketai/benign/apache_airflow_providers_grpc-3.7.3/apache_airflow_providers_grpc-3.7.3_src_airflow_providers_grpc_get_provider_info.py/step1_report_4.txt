{
  "purpose": "Provides metadata and configuration information for the 'apache-airflow-providers-grpc' package, including versioning, dependencies, and integration details.",
  "sources": "The only data source is the return statement within the get_provider_info() function, which returns static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or other effects.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows since the function returns static data without external input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be auto-generated, contains no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious logic. It strictly defines static package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple Python function returning a dictionary with package information, dependencies, and configuration details. It contains no input handling, no external communication, no dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behavior. The content matches typical auto-generated package metadata used in Python packaging systems. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated configuration script providing package metadata for 'apache-airflow-providers-grpc'. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
