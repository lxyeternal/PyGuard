  "purpose": "Provides metadata information about the 'apache-airflow-providers-grpc' package, including versions, dependencies, and integration details.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded data within the get_provider_info() function, including package details, versions, dependencies, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data output or external data usage beyond static URLs and data definitions.",
  "flows": "The function returns a static dictionary; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, static, and auto-generated documentation info. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that returns a hardcoded dictionary containing package metadata such as name, description, versions, dependencies, and related URLs. It is purely static data with no user input, data manipulation, or external data retrieval. The structure and content indicate auto-generated documentation or metadata configuration, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static metadata provider for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be an automatically generated configuration file, not code designed to perform any malicious actions.",
