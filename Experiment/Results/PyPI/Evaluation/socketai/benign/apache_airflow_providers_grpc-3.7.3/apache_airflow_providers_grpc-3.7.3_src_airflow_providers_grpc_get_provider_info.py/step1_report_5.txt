{
  "purpose": "The function get_provider_info() provides metadata about the 'apache-airflow-providers-grpc' package, including version info, dependencies, and integrations.",
  "sources": "Data sources include hardcoded package info, version lists, dependency strings, and URLs within the return dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs static data; potential sinks are data consumption or display points outside this function, but none are explicitly shown here.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static definitions within the return dictionary to external modules or systems that may consume this metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be auto-generated boilerplate with static data; no dynamic input handling or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward function returning a static dictionary with package metadata. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The code is clearly boilerplate, generated from a template, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as static package metadata, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a standard generated file with no suspicious behavior.",
