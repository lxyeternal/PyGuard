  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is static, auto-generated package metadata.\n- No external input, no data flows involving untrusted sources, no network activity.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is straightforward, returning hardcoded data.\n\n**Malware and obfuscation scores:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- Given the static, metadata-only nature, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Security risk scores:**\n- All reports assign securityRisk = 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only aspect worth noting is that the code is auto-generated and static, which is typical for package metadata files.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform dynamic code execution, or communicate externally.\n\n**Any inconsistencies or unreasonable scores?**\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable given the content.\n- No need to adjust scores upward; the code is benign.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is purely static metadata with no malicious features.\n- All scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) should remain at 0.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **malware:** 0\n- **obfuscated:** 0\n- **risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code poses no security risks. The scores are justified and should not be changed.",
