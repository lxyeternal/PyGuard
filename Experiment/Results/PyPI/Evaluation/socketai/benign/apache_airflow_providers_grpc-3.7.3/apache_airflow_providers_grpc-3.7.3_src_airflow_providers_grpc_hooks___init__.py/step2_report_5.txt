  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is a license header comment with no executable content, data flows, or suspicious elements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — all appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, confirms the snippet is a license header with no executable or malicious content.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard license comment, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same reasoning; purely licensing comments, no code or data flows.\n- **Scores:** all zero, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; benign license header comment.\n- **Scores:** all zero, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that these snippets are license headers, which are comments and contain no executable code, data flows, or suspicious elements.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** Correctly scored as zero, since there is no code to obfuscate or maliciously embed.\n- **Security risk:** Appropriately scored as zero; license headers are standard legal notices.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\n- The code snippets are purely comments, serving as licensing information.\n- No executable code, data handling, or embedded malicious elements are present.\n- The scores are consistent with the content.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation or code.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk associated with license comments.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments needed.",
