{
  "purpose": "Provides a wrapper function for natural sorting using the natsort library to enhance sorting order in other code.",
  "sources": "Imports natsorted from the natsort library; the function itself uses *args and **kwargs to accept input data and parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted data directly nor write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed to natsorted via *args and **kwargs; the sorted result is returned. No external data flow or network activity present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple wrapper function around the natsort library's natsorted function. It accepts arbitrary positional and keyword arguments, calls natsorted, and returns its result. There are no data leaks, external communications, or malicious code segments. The code appears straightforward and standard for enhancing sorting behavior. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility function wrapping an existing sorting library without any malicious intent or security issues. It does not pose any threat or risk.",
