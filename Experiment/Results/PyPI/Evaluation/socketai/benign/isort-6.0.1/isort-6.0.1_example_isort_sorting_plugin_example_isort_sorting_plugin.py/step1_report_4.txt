{
  "purpose": "The code provides a wrapper function for natural sorting using the natsort library, intended to enhance sorting order in isort or similar tools.",
  "sources": "The function reads input arguments *args and **kwargs passed to natsorted, which in turn reads data to be sorted.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only calls an external library function without executing untrusted data or code.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed to natsorted via *args/*kwargs, which returns a sorted list. The function then returns this sorted list.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no anomalies. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the natsorted function from the natsort library. It defines a wrapper function that calls natsorted with arbitrary arguments, returning the sorted result. There are no input validation, no data modification, and no side effects. The implementation is simple and relies on an external, well-known library. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is detected. The code is minimal and directly delegates sorting to natsorted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple wrapper around a sorting function with no signs of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for utility purposes.",
