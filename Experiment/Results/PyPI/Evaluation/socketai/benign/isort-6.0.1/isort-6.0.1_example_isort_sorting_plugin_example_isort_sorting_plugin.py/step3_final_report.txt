{
  "purpose": "A wrapper function around natsort's natsorted to provide natural sorting functionality.",
  "sources": "Arguments passed to natural_plus, which are forwarded to natsorted.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow directly into natsorted without additional processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses a well-known library.",
  "analysis": "The code imports natsorted from natsort and defines natural_plus as a direct wrapper, passing all arguments to natsorted. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. The code does not handle untrusted data directly, nor does it perform network or file operations. The dependency natsort is a trusted, open-source library, and the code's simplicity indicates no malicious intent. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility wrapper for natural sorting, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The dependency used is widely trusted. The scores are justified and accurate; no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
