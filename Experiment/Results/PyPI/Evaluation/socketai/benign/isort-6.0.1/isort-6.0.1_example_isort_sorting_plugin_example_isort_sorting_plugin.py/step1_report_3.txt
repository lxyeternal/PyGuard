{
  "purpose": "Provides a function to perform natural sorting using the natsort library, intended to enhance sorting order in isort.",
  "sources": "Imports from the natsort library; the function uses arguments passed to natsorted.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data processing; the code simply calls an external library function.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into natsorted, and the sorted result is returned. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward, importing a library and defining a wrapper function.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known library 'natsort' and defines a function that wraps the 'natsorted' function for natural sorting. It includes a docstring explaining purpose. No user input, environment variable use, or untrusted data handling is present. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs identified. The usage appears benign and intended for sorting purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple wrapper for a natural sorting function with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is safe and performs its intended purpose without any signs of sabotage or malware.",
