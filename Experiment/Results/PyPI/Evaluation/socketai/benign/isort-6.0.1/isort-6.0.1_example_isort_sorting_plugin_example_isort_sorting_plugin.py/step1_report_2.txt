{
  "purpose": "Provide a function that performs natural sorting of input data using the natsort library.",
  "sources": "Importing the natsorted function from the natsort library.",
  "sinks": "Return statement calling natsorted; no untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are passed directly to natsorted, and the output is returned; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward use of a third-party library for sorting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports natsorted from natsort and defines a wrapper function 'natural_plus' that calls natsorted with the provided arguments. The function is meant to enhance sorting behavior, specifically for sorting strings in a natural order. The implementation is simple and directly delegates to a well-known library without additional logic or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets, malicious patterns, or suspicious code constructs are present. The third-party library usage is legitimate and common for such functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign wrapper around the natsort library, providing natural sorting functionality without any malicious intent or security issues.",
