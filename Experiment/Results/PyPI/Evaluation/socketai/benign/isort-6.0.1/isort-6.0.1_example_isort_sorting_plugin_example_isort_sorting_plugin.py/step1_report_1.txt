{
  "purpose": "Provides a function for natural sorting using the natsort library, likely to be used for sorting collections in a more human-friendly order.",
  "sources": "Imports the natsorted function from the natsort library.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; function returns sorted data without side effects.",
  "flows": "Input arguments to natsorted; output is the sorted collection.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a known third-party library and defines a simple wrapper function for natural sorting. There are no suspicious operations such as network access, file manipulation, or data exfiltration. The function does not handle untrusted input directly but relies on natsorted, which is a standard library. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility wrapper around the natsort library for natural sorting. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected.",
