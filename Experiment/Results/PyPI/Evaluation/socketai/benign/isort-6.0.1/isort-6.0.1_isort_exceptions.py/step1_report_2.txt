  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the isort Python package, used for import sorting configuration and error handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (functools, pathlib, typing) and relative import of 'profiles'.",
  "sinks": "Exception initialization and message formatting, which do not process untrusted data in a security-sensitive manner.",
  "flows": "Exception constructors generate error messages; no data flows from external untrusted sources into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. The code purely defines exceptions with straightforward message formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for various exception types, all inheriting from a base exception. The messages are generated based on input parameters, but there is no evidence of handling untrusted input in a way that could lead to code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The use of string formatting in exception messages appears safe, as no untrusted data is processed beyond formatting. The code is purely structural and does not perform any network activity, file manipulation, or system modifications. No suspicious or malicious logic is identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for error handling within the isort package. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no indications of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
