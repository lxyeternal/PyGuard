  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically to determine the presence of issues, consistency of scoring, and potential security risks.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes for the isort package.\n- The code relies solely on constructor parameters to generate error messages.\n- No external data access, network activity, or code execution occurs.\n- The use of `partial` in `__reduce__` is standard for pickling support.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, with no complex logic or data manipulation beyond message formatting.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct, and all classes inherit appropriately.\n- **Security concerns:** No evidence of data leaks, malicious code, or vulnerabilities.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Data flows:** Only occurs in exception message formatting, which is safe here.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Malware:** Not present.\n- **Supply chain risk:** No signs of sabotage or malicious modifications.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the exception class definitions.\n- The use of string formatting for error messages is standard and safe.\n- The `__reduce__` method with `partial` is typical for pickling, not malicious.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities identified)\n\nAll reports assign very high confidence (1.0) and zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Code safety:** The code is benign, standard exception class definitions.\n- **Potential issues:** None identified.\n- **Supply chain risk:** Very low; no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- No changes needed; the scoring is reasonable and consistent.\n- The detailed analysis confirms that this code is purely structural, with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for isort, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate, and the risk is effectively zero.",
