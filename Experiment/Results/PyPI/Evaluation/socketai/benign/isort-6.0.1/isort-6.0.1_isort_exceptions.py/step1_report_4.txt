{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for the isort package, used for handling specific error conditions during import sorting and configuration validation.",
  "sources": "Input sources include parameters passed during exception instantiation, such as file paths, profile names, sort order, formatters, code snippets, and unsupported settings.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include exception message strings constructed with input data, which could contain untrusted input if not sanitized, but are used solely for error reporting and do not execute code or process data beyond string formatting.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (file paths, profile names, code, settings) into exception messages and attributes, but no untrusted data is used in dangerous operations such as code execution or network access.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code solely defines exception classes with straightforward string formatting and attribute storage. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, malicious network activity, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception class. Each class is designed to encapsulate specific error conditions in the isort tool, with messages constructed from input parameters. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as hidden code, data exfiltration, or remote connections. All operations are standard and involve string formatting, exception attribute assignment, and class inheritance. The code does not process or execute external data beyond simple string formatting for error messages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining exception types related to the isort package and contains no malicious code or security risks. It simply formats error messages based on provided inputs, which are used for debugging or user notifications. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
