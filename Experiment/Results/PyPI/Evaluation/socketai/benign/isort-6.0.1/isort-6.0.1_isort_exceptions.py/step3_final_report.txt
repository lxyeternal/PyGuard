{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the isort package to handle various error conditions with descriptive messages.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters such as file paths, profile names, code snippets, and settings used to generate exception messages.",
  "sinks": "Exception message strings formatted from input parameters; no external data processing or transmission occurs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> formatted exception messages; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions with constructors that format messages based on parameters. The use of __reduce__ with functools.partial supports pickling but is standard. No network, file I/O, or dynamic code execution is present. Exception messages are constructed from parameters only for reporting, with no processing of untrusted data beyond string formatting. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign and structural nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident, and the code serves solely for error handling within the package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of exception classes for isort, posing no security risks or malicious activity. The scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
