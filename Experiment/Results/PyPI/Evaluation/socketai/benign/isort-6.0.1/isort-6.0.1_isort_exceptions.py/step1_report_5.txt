{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios in the isort Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports from functools, pathlib, typing, and relative import of profiles; class methods and initializers; exception message strings.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; code primarily defines exceptions with message strings and attributes. No data flows from untrusted sources or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data processing or untrusted data flow present; only exception message construction and class attribute assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines exception classes related to the isort package. It includes standard inheritance from Exception, detailed messages, and some static attributes. The only potentially dynamic element is the use of string formatting for error messages, which is standard and safe. No user input handling, network communication, or external data processing is present. The code appears to be a well-structured, isolated module for exception handling without malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign set of custom exception classes for the isort package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks within this module.",
