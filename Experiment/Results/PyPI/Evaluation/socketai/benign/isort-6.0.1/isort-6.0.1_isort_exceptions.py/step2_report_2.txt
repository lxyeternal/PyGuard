  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines multiple custom exception classes for the isort package.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network access, or data manipulation beyond constructing error messages.\n   - Uses standard Python exception inheritance and straightforward string formatting.\n   - The `__reduce__` method with `partial` is used for pickling support, which is standard practice.\n\n2. **Potential Data Flows and Sinks:**\n   - Exception messages are built from constructor parameters, such as file paths, profile names, code snippets, etc.\n   - These parameters could potentially be untrusted if supplied externally, but the code does not process or execute them—only includes them in error messages.\n   - No external system calls, network activity, or file I/O within this code segment.\n\n3. **Anomalies or Suspicious Patterns:**\n   - No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n   - The use of `partial` in `__reduce__` is standard for serialization, not malicious.\n   - No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. The code is purely structural and does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (0.0 or 0.5). Given the code's nature, a risk score of 0 is justified. No external vulnerabilities or security risks are introduced.\n\n5. **Assessment of Each Report:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n   - The detailed reasoning confirms that the code's purpose is solely to define exception classes with descriptive messages.\n   - No inconsistencies or unreasonable scores are observed.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a standard, well-structured exception class module for the isort package.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The scores given in the reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Expert Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n\nThe code is benign, purely structural, and does not introduce any security concerns.",
