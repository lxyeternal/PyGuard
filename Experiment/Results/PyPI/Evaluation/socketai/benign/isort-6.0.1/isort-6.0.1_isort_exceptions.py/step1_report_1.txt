{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the isort Python package to handle various error conditions during import sorting operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input primarily through constructor parameters such as file paths, code snippets, profiles, and settings.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include error message strings constructed with input parameters, which could include file paths, code snippets, or profile names.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data flows into exception message strings via constructor arguments; these are then raised as exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, such as network calls, file writes, or data exfiltration mechanisms, are present. The code mainly constructs and raises exceptions based on input parameters. The use of `partial` in `__reduce__` is standard for pickling, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for error handling in isort, with no apparent data manipulation, network access, or other suspicious behaviors. Input parameters are used solely for constructing descriptive error messages. The use of `__reduce__` with `partial` is standard for serialization. All data flows are contained within exception message generation, with no external data access or influence beyond parameter passing. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard exception class definition module for isort, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines error types used for handling various error scenarios in import sorting operations.",
