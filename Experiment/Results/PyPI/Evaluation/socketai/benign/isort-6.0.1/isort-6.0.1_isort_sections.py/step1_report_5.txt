  "purpose": "Defines constants for different import section categories used by the isort tool.",
  "sources": "The module imports the 'Tuple' type from the 'typing' library.",
  "targets": "The code does not process untrusted input or data; it only defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code is purely defining static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard typing feature and defines string constants for categorizing import sections in a Python project. It also defines a tuple aggregating these categories. There is no dynamic code, user input, or external data processing. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely defines static constants used for organizing import sections in the isort tool. There are no security concerns or malicious elements.",
