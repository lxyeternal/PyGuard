  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Verification:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static string constants and a tuple, with no dynamic behavior, input handling, or external interactions. The code is straightforward and serves as configuration labels for the isort tool.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions. They correctly state that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n   - They do not overstate the security posture; they correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - The securityRisk score is also 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   - No report suggests any dynamic, obfuscated, or malicious behavior.  \n   - The code is static, simple, and clearly intended as configuration constants.  \n   - Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified. The current scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \n   - All reports correctly identify that there is no malware present.  \n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing code, handling untrusted data, or obfuscating logic.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the code's characteristics and the analysis provided.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**  \n- The code is a simple, static configuration module defining constants for the isort tool.  \n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The assigned scores (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**  \n- Based on all reports and the code review, I agree with the current scores.  \n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely declarative and benign.",
