  "purpose": "Define default section labels used by the isort Python import sorting tool.",
  "sources": "The module imports 'Tuple' from the 'typing' library.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code consists solely of constant string definitions and a tuple aggregation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Tuple' from 'typing' to specify type annotations. It then defines several string constants representing import sections and groups them into a tuple. No dynamic execution, external data input, or sensitive operations are present. All elements are static strings used for configuration or labeling purposes within a code formatting tool. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration component for the isort tool, containing only static string constants and type annotations. It does not exhibit any malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
