{
  "purpose": "Define constants for categorizing import sections used by isort, a Python import sorting tool.",
  "sources": "The module imports the 'Tuple' type from the 'typing' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists of simple constant definitions and an import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Tuple' from 'typing' for type annotation purposes. It then defines several string constants representing different sections used by isort: 'FUTURE', 'STDLIB', 'THIRDPARTY', 'FIRSTPARTY', and 'LOCALFOLDER'. These constants are then combined into a tuple 'DEFAULT'. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. It appears to be a utility module for configuration, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility module defining constants for an import sorting tool. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security concerns.",
