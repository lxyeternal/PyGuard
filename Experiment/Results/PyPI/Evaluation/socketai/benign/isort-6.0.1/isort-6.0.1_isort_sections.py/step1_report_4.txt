{
  "purpose": "Defines constants representing different sections used by the 'isort' Python import sorting tool.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; all constants are predefined string literals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving external input; the code only assigns string constants to variables and a tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behavior observed; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code declares string constants representing import sections for 'isort', a known Python import sorting library. It assigns static string values to variables with no processing or external interactions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely declarative, serving as configuration or constants for the 'isort' tool. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
