  "purpose": "Defines section labels used by the isort Python import sorting tool.",

  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or output.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares constant string variables representing import section categories and aggregates them into a tuple. There are no dynamic behaviors, input handling, external interactions, or obfuscated elements. All elements are static and straightforward, serving as configuration labels for the isort tool.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign configuration code with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
