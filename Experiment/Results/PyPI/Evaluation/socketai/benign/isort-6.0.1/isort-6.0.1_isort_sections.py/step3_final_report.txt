  "purpose": "Define categorization sections used by the isort tool for organizing imports.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions for import categories and a tuple aggregating them.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; purely static definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; constants are assigned static string values with no dynamic or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants representing import sections and a tuple aggregating these constants. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data handling, or operations. The code serves as configuration metadata for the isort tool. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, with confidence scores of 1. The scores are consistent with the static, straightforward nature of the code. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module defining import section labels for isort. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
