  "purpose": "Defines static formatting profiles for code styling tools as Python dictionaries for easy reuse within projects.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static dictionary definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration data with no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static data definitions with no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of predefined Python dictionaries representing various formatting profiles. It uses standard idioms like copying and updating dictionaries, with no external dependencies, no user input, no code execution, and no network activity. All profiles are static, well-structured, and serve configuration purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is benign, and the structure is clear and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module defining formatting profiles for code styling tools. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
