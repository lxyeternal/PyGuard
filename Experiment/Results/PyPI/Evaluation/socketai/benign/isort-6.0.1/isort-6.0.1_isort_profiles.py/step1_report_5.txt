  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or output points are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; all data are static configuration definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists of static data structures with no dynamic or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of static dictionary definitions used for configuring code formatting profiles. No external inputs, user data, or network communications are involved. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. The data are straightforward profile settings for formatting tools, and there are no suspicious code flows or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as a configuration reference for code formatting profiles. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
