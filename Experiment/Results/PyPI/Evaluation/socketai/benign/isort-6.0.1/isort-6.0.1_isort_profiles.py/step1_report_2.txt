  "purpose": "Define and store formatting profiles for use in code formatting tools.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; all data is statically defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could influence the system; no external communication, database, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code is purely static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors; straightforward dictionary definitions and copying.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing for type annotations but does not utilize any dynamic code execution or external data sources. It defines multiple configuration dictionaries for formatting profiles, some of which are built by copying and updating existing dictionaries. There is no indication of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or system modifications are present. All code is static and focused on data structure definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code purely defines static configuration data for formatting profiles. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It appears to be a benign setup for formatting preferences.",
