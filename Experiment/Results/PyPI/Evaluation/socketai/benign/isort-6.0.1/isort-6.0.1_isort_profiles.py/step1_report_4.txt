{
  "purpose": "Define various formatting profiles for use with a code formatter, likely for consistent code style configuration.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of dictionaries representing different formatting profiles; no input or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to vulnerabilities; static configuration data only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static data definitions only; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors detected. All code consists of static dictionary definitions and data copying/updating.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple styling profiles as Python dictionaries, which are stored in a 'profiles' dictionary. No external input, user input handling, or dynamic code execution is present. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or data leakage mechanisms are evident. The code appears solely as configuration data, intended for styling or formatting purposes. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code. The code is well-structured, uses safe Python idioms, and does not perform any actions beyond static data assignment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely configuration data defining style profiles, with no malicious or security-sensitive components. It does not contain malware or security risks and can be safely used as part of a project for formatting purposes.",
