  "purpose": "A diff utility for displaying unified diffs, formatting import statements, and prompting user confirmation for applying changes.",
  "sources": "Reading input strings for diff content, user input via input(), file metadata via Path.stat()",
  "sinks": "User input prompts (input()), output streams for diff display and messages",
  "flows": "Input strings -> unified_diff() -> diff_line() -> output; user input -> ask_whether_to_apply_changes_to_file() -> control flow",
  "anomalies": "Use of input() prompts; optional colorama import with runtime check; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward diff utility with functions for formatting import statements, displaying diffs with optional color, and prompting user for confirmation. It uses standard libraries and handles optional dependencies gracefully. No network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious payloads are present. The use of input() prompts is typical for CLI tools and does not indicate malicious intent. The regex patterns and diff generation are standard. The colorama handling includes a safe check for availability. Overall, the code is transparent, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard diff utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.0, risk: ~0.1) are appropriate and justified given the code's functionality and structure.",
