{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for showing unified diffs between file contents, formatting import lines, asking user confirmation for applying changes, removing whitespace, and printing output with optional colorization.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the content of files (file_input, file_output), file path for modification timestamps, and user input via input() function.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow to sys.stdout, sys.stderr, or a provided output stream; user input collected via input() can influence control flow.",
  "flows": "User input controls whether changes are applied; diff lines are printed directly to output streams; file timestamps are retrieved via file_path.stat().",
  "anomalies": "Use of input() prompts could be exploited for denial of service if used improperly; no hardcoded secrets or credentials present; no suspicious network activity or system modifications are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily for diff visualization and user interaction. It imports standard libraries and attempts to import 'colorama' for colored output. No external network communication, file modification, or system alterations are evident. The use of input() for user prompts is standard but could be misused for denial of service if the script runs unattended. No malicious or sabotage behaviors, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection, are observed. The code appears benign and aligns with typical utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a diff utility with optional colored output and user prompts. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, nor does it perform any suspicious activities. The overall security risk is negligible.",
