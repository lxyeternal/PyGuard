{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for diff visualization, formatting import statements, user interaction for applying changes, and console output styling, primarily for use in code review or diff tools.",
  "sources": "Input is read from user prompts (input function), file system (file_path.stat()), and external libraries (imported modules).",
  "sinks": "Output to stdout, stderr, and user input prompts; the diff output and messages are sent to terminal streams.",
  "flows": "Data from file_path (modification time) flows into diff display; user input determines whether to apply changes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of input() with no sanitization; potential reliance on external libraries for terminal coloring; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic; no dynamic code execution or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility module for diff display, import formatting, and user prompts. It imports standard libraries and optional colorama for coloring output. No malicious functions or data exfiltration methods are present. User input is used to decide whether to apply file changes, but this is a benign interaction. The diff display relies on standard Python libraries. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as network communication, data theft, or system sabotage are detected. The only minor concern is the use of input() for user confirmation, which is common in CLI tools, not malicious. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility script intended for diff visualization and user interaction in code review processes. There are no indicators of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. The overall security risk score is low, with no malicious behavior detected.",
