{
  "purpose": "The code searches for Python source files in provided paths, applying filtering rules for skipping certain files or directories based on configuration.",
  "sources": "Input paths from function argument 'paths', reading directory contents via os.walk, and file existence checks using os.path functions.",
  "sinks": "Yielding file paths as strings; checking if files are supported or skipped via config methods.",
  "flows": "Input paths -> Directory traversal with os.walk -> Filtering based on config -> Yielding supported, non-skipped file paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. Use of standard os and pathlib functions with no dynamic execution or external data manipulation. The code relies on external config for skipping/support checks but does not appear malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory traversal and file filtering based on a provided configuration object. It maintains a set of visited directories to avoid repeats, skips directories/files as instructed by config, and yields supported source files. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The use of standard library functions and external config suggests controlled behavior. There are no signs of hidden malicious intent or malicious payloads. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical source code discovery patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard directory traversal and filtering utility for locating Python source files, with no indication of malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be part of a larger, benign codebase used for source file discovery. No malware or security risks are detected.",
