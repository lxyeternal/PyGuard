{
  "purpose": "The code searches for Python source files within given paths, applying skip and support rules based on configuration.",
  "sources": "Paths provided in the 'paths' iterable; filesystem access via os.path and os.walk; user-defined config methods for skip and support checks.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly. The code yields file paths and appends to 'skipped' and 'broken' lists based on conditions, but does not perform any risky operations like executing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "Input paths -> Directory traversal with os.walk -> Conditional checks with config methods -> Yielding file paths or modifying skip/broken lists.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors observed. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no credential handling.",
  "analysis": "The script performs filesystem traversal, filtering files based on configuration rules, and manages visited directories to avoid cycles. All operations are related to file path handling. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are evident. The code is straightforward and employs standard library functions. It relies on external 'config' methods, but these are expected to be benign, as they are typical in configuration-based file filtering. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard file discovery utility for Python files with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It does not perform any suspicious network, system, or data operations. Overall, it is safe and intended for project file management.",
