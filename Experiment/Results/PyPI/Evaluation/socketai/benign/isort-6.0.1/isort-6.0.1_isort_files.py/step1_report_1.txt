{
  "purpose": "The function finds and yields Python source files from given paths, supporting directory traversal with skip and support checks.",
  "sources": "Paths provided in the 'paths' parameter, os.path and Path functions for file and directory checks, config.is_skipped, config.is_supported_filetype",
  "sinks": "Yielding file paths; no direct data leaks or insecure operations are evident",
  "flows": "Input paths -> Directory traversal and file filtering -> Yield supported file paths or record skipped/broken paths",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious URL or network activity, no obfuscated code, and no malicious backdoors observed",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory traversal and file filtering based on support and skip conditions, utilizing standard os and Path functions. It manages visited directories to prevent loops. No external or untrusted data is processed insecurely. The functions used (os.walk, Path.resolve, is_skipped, is_supported_filetype) are standard and do not contain malicious behaviors. No suspicious patterns such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard directory and file processing routine with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply filters and yields file paths based on provided configurations.",
