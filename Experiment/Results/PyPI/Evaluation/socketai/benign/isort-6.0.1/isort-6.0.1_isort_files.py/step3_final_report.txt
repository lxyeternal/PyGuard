  "purpose": "Utility for finding and iterating over all Python source files in specified paths, applying skip and support rules.",
  "sources": "Filesystem paths read during os.path.isdir, os.walk, Path.resolve, and Path.is_skipped checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no network or system modification operations present.",
  "flows": "Paths are read and resolved; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily filesystem traversal.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward directory traversal with standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory traversal, filtering files based on configuration methods, and manages visited directories to prevent loops. It uses standard Python libraries and functions, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The logic is consistent, and the code is clear and benign. No suspicious behaviors, such as network activity, code injection, or credential handling, are present. The use of Path.resolve() is standard and does not introduce risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified and align with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe filesystem traversal utility for locating Python files, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
