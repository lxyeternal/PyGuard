{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom linter class that integrates with the pylama linting framework and calls an external API to check Python files for correct import sorting.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'path' parameter passed to the run() method, and potentially interacts with the 'api.check_file' function.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the 'api.check_file' function call, which may process or analyze the file. No untrusted data is written or sent elsewhere explicitly.",
  "flows": "Input 'path' is passed to 'api.check_file' within a try block; the function's behavior determines if the file passes the check or not. No external network or file writes are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The suppress_stdout context temporarily redirects sys.stdout but is a common pattern for silencing output.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and external libraries. The suppress_stdout context redirects stdout to suppress output during 'api.check_file' execution. The 'Linter' class extends 'BaseLinter' and overrides 'allow' and 'run' methods. The 'allow' method filters for Python files. The 'run' method uses 'api.check_file' to validate files and returns specific error messages if checks fail. There is exception handling for 'FileSkipped' but no other suspicious exception handling or malicious logic. No data exfiltration, command execution, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a custom linter that integrates an external API for import sorting checks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It mainly facilitates code quality enforcement.",
