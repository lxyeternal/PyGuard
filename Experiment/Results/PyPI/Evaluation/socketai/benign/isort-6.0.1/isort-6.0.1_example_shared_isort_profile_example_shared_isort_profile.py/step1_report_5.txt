  "purpose": "Configuration settings for a code formatting or pretty-printing tool, likely used for Python code styling.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading operations are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward dictionary assignment defining formatting options. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary named PROFILE with formatting options such as multi_line_output, include_trailing_comma, force_grid_wrap, use_parentheses, and line_length. All values are simple literals, with no external data reading, input, or potentially malicious constructs. The code appears to serve as a configuration profile, typical for a code formatter like Black or similar tools. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration dictionary setting parameters for a formatting tool. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues are identified.",
