  "purpose": "Static configuration dictionary for code formatting options, serving as a benign setup without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "No input, external data, or dynamic code; static dictionary assignment.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data with no data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static configuration with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static dictionary defining formatting parameters, likely for a code formatter like Black. All reviews correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent and appropriate given the code's nature. No external data, input, or dynamic execution is present, and the code does not perform any malicious actions or contain hidden payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless static configuration object with no security concerns or malicious intent. The assessments and scores across all reports are accurate and justified.",
