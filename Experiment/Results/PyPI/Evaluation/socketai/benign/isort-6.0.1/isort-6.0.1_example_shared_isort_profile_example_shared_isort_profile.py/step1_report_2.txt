{
  "purpose": "The code defines a configuration dictionary for code formatting, likely used by a code formatter tool such as Black or similar.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded configuration parameters from the dictionary initialization.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that process untrusted input or could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static assignment of a configuration dictionary with parameters related to code formatting. It involves no input/output operations, external data, or dynamic execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent. The configuration appears typical for a formatting tool, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely defining a configuration dictionary with no malicious intent or security risks.",
