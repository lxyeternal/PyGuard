  "purpose": "Configuration dictionary likely used for code formatting or code style settings, possibly for a code formatter or linter.",
  "sources": "The code reads a predefined dictionary 'PROFILE' assigned with specific configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process external input or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of a static dictionary assignment without any unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static configuration dictionary named PROFILE with specific formatting options. There are no functions, no input processing, no external data handling. It appears to be a configuration setup, possibly for a code formatter or styling tool. No signs of malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The structure and content are straightforward and typical for configuration data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration dictionary with no malicious intent. It serves as a static configuration setup, with no indications of malware or security risks.",
