{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for sorting and formatting Python literals and assignment statements, primarily for code organization or formatting purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input code strings, splits into lines, and processes literals via 'ast.literal_eval'. External formatting functions may be invoked if configured.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted code snippets; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input code string -> parsing and evaluation -> sorting/formatting -> output code string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; safe use of 'ast.literal_eval'; potential external influence via 'config.formatting_function', which could be misused if untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility module for sorting and formatting Python literals and assignment statements. It employs 'ast.literal_eval' for safe literal evaluation, avoiding code execution risks. The functions are straightforward, with no network, file, or system modifications. The registration of custom types for sorting is standard. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The only minor concern is external 'formatting_function' which, if malicious, could introduce security issues, but this depends on external configuration, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for sorting and formatting literals, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is appropriate, primarily considering the potential misuse of external formatting functions if they are untrusted. Overall, the code is safe for supply chain inclusion.",
