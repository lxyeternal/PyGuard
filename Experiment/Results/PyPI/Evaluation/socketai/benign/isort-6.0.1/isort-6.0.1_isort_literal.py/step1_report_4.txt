{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to parse, sort, and reformat Python literals such as lists, dicts, sets, and tuples, and to process assignments in code strings.",
  "sources": "Reads code string input, specifically lines containing assignment statements and code literals. Uses 'ast.literal_eval' to parse literals.",
  "sinks": "Outputs sorted and formatted code snippets, including re-serialization of literals and code strings. Does not perform network I/O or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Source: input code string -> 'assignments' or 'assignment' functions -> literal parsing via 'ast.literal_eval' -> sorting functions registered via decorators -> formatted output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Uses 'ast.literal_eval', which is safe for parsing literals. No obfuscated code or hidden dynamic execution detected. No external or network calls present. The code solely manipulates data structures and code formatting.",
  "analysis": "The script is a utility for sorting and formatting Python literals within code strings. It registers various sorting functions for data types like dict, list, set, and tuple, and applies them based on the provided sort type. It handles assignment lines, sorts values, and reconstructs code snippets. The use of 'ast.literal_eval' ensures safe evaluation of literals. No network or system modifications are present. The functions appear purely focused on code formatting and sorting without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for code formatting and literal sorting, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It strictly performs data manipulation and formatting tasks.",
