{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions and classes to parse, sort, and pretty-print Python literals such as lists, tuples, dicts, and sets, with support for custom sorting and formatting functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input in the form of code strings, specifically from the 'code' parameter in functions 'assignments' and 'assignment'.",
  "sinks": "The code processes and outputs sorted string representations of literals, but does not directly interact with external data sinks such as network or files.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed to evaluate literals; the sorted and formatted output is generated through functions and returned as code strings. No external untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks like network, disk, or environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present. The code primarily handles sorting and formatting literals with no evident malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a module for sorting Python literals with customizable formatting. It includes functions for parsing code strings, evaluating literals, and registering custom sorting behaviors. No evidence of malicious code such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions operate locally on provided input strings and literals. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious data flows are detected. The overall design appears to be a utility for code formatting and sorting, consistent with legitimate use cases.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for sorting and formatting Python literals. No signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks are evident. It does not perform any external communications or access sensitive data. The structure and content are consistent with standard code formatting tools.",
