{
  "purpose": "The code formats import sections of Python files using the 'black' code formatter, based on file extension and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'contents' parameter (import section as string), 'extension' parameter (file extension), and 'config' (isort configuration object).",
  "sinks": "The 'black.format_file_contents' function acts as a sink, outputting formatted code or raising an exception; no other external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input strings ('contents', 'extension') flow into the 'black.format_file_contents' function, which produces formatted code as output.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward without obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. Exception handling only catches 'black.NothingChanged', which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'black' and 'isort' modules and defines a function to format code sections using 'black'. It checks the file extension before formatting, using 'black.format_file_contents' with specific mode settings. Exception handling is limited to a known 'black.NothingChanged' exception, returning original contents if no changes occur. No suspicious code, malicious behavior, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The logic is typical for code formatting utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for formatting Python code snippets with 'black', with no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It functions as expected for code formatting purposes.",
