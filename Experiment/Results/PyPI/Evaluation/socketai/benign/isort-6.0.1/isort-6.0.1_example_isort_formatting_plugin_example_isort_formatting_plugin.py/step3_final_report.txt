{
  "purpose": "Format Python import sections using 'black' if the file extension indicates a Python file.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'contents' (code snippet), 'extension' (file extension), 'config' (formatting configuration).",
  "sinks": "The function returns formatted code or original contents; no untrusted data sinks or external effects are involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'contents' flows into 'black.format_file_contents' when extension is 'py' or 'pyi'; output is the formatted code or original contents if no change or exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard library usage, proper exception handling, and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'black' and 'isort', checks file extension, formats code with 'black' if applicable, and handles 'NothingChanged' exception. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure behavior is present. The logic is clear and standard for code formatting utilities. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or code injection is detected. The scores from all reports (malware, obfuscated, security risk) are zero, consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for formatting Python code snippets. All reports correctly identify its benign intent and behavior. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
