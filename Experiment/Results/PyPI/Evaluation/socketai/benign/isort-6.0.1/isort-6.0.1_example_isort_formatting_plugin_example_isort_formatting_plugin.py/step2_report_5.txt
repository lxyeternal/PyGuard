  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security implications, and the scoring consistency.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Imports 'black' and 'isort'.\n- Defines a function that formats a code snippet ('contents') if the file extension indicates a Python file ('.py' or '.pyi').\n- Uses 'black.format_file_contents' to perform formatting.\n- Handles 'black.NothingChanged' exception to return original contents if no change occurs.\n- No other suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Reports 1-5**:\n- All describe the code as a straightforward, benign utility for formatting Python code snippets.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent are identified.\n- The analysis consistently notes the use of standard libraries, proper exception handling, and no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n### Key points:\n- **Code correctness**: The code logic matches the description; it correctly formats code based on extension.\n- **Malware assessment**: No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation**: None present.\n- **Security risk**: None identified; the code is a safe utility.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated**: All assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk**: All assign 0, justified by the benign nature.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The only potential concern could be the use of 'black.format_file_contents' on untrusted code. However, 'black' is a well-known formatter, and formatting code does not inherently introduce security risks unless it involves executing or injecting code, which it does not here.\n- The code does not execute or evaluate the input; it merely formats it.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score**: Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score**: Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk score**: Should remain at 0, as the code performs a benign formatting task with no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a standard, safe utility for formatting Python import sections using 'black'. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should not be adjusted.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nAll reports correctly reflect this assessment.",
