{
  "purpose": "The function formats a given import section of Python code using the Black code formatter, based on the file extension and provided configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads the variable 'contents' (the code section to format), 'extension' (file extension), and 'config' (Black configuration object).",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is 'black.format_file_contents', which formats and returns code content; however, it operates on provided input without executing it.",
  "flows": "The input 'contents' flows into 'black.format_file_contents', which outputs formatted code. No other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are detected. Usage of standard libraries 'black' and 'isort' is legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around 'black.format_file_contents' to conditionally format code contents based on extension. It handles exceptions gracefully. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The functions and libraries used are standard and intended for code formatting, with no network, file, or system manipulation observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a safe and legitimate function for code formatting without any indication of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious behavior, and the usage appears normal.",
