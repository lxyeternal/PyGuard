{
  "purpose": "The code formats import sections of Python files using the 'black' formatter, based on file extension and configuration.",
  "sources": "Input: 'contents' parameter (the code contents), 'extension' parameter (file extension), 'config' parameter (formatting configuration).",
  "sinks": "Function call to 'black.format_file_contents' which processes the code content; no direct untrusted sink, but the formatting function operates on potentially untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input 'contents' is passed to 'black.format_file_contents' for formatting; the extension and config influence the behavior. No data flows outside these functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Usage of 'black' and 'isort' is standard; no obfuscation or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility function that formats a given code snippet using 'black', conditional on the file extension being 'py' or 'pyi'. It employs a try-except block to handle 'black.NothingChanged' exceptions gracefully. No malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors, are evident. The code appears straightforward and standard for a formatting utility.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign code snippet designed to format Python code snippets; no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior. It securely calls a known formatter without any evident malicious logic or anomalies.",
