{
  "purpose": "The code formats import sections of Python files using the black formatter, based on file extension and configuration.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'contents' (the code to be formatted), 'extension' (file extension), and 'config' (formatting configuration).",
  "sinks": "Return of formatted code via 'black.format_file_contents' which processes the input contents.",
  "flows": "Input 'contents' flows into 'black.format_file_contents', which outputs formatted code; 'extension' influences the mode used for formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code patterns, or suspicious dynamic execution; the code is straightforward formatting logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'black' and 'isort', then defines a function to format a code segment based on file extension. It verifies the extension, then uses 'black.format_file_contents' to format the code if applicable, catching 'NothingChanged' exceptions to return unmodified contents. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations. The use of standard libraries and functions is consistent with normal formatting tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for formatting Python import sections using black. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious data handling, and adheres to typical formatting procedures. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
