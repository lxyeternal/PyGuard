  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward utility for formatting Python import sections using 'black'.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code only interacts with 'black' and 'isort' libraries, both standard for code formatting.\n- Exception handling is limited to 'black.NothingChanged', which is standard.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The purpose, data flow, and sinks are consistent with benign formatting tasks.\n\n**Code Validation:**\n- The code imports 'black' and 'isort'.\n- Checks file extension before formatting.\n- Calls 'black.format_file_contents' with appropriate mode.\n- Handles 'NothingChanged' exception gracefully.\n- Returns original contents if no changes or exceptions occur.\n\n**Potential Risks:**\n- The 'black' formatter is a well-known, safe library.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or file manipulations are present.\n- The code does not process untrusted data beyond formatting, which is safe.\n\n**Scores Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, safe utility for formatting Python code snippets.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n**Overall Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
