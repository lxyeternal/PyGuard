The static URLs and dummy data are typical placeholders in testing code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk. Overall, the code is safe, well-implemented, and suitable for testing purposes."

It executes user functions as part of its normal operation but does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The security risk is low and inherent to the framework's design, not indicative of malicious intent."
