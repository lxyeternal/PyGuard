  "purpose": "Generates a constrained float value based on attributes of a ConstrainedFloat object, using utility functions for range calculation and random number generation.",
  "sources": "Attributes of the 'field' object such as 'gt', 'ge', 'lt', 'le', 'multiple_of'; functions 'get_constrained_number_range', 'generate_constrained_number', 'create_random_float'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input into sensitive sinks or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input attributes -> get_constrained_number_range -> generate_constrained_number -> return float",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for generating constrained float values based on specified constraints. It imports standard functions, conditionally imports for type checking, and performs simple calculations without side effects. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The logic is clear, and the functions used are typical for data generation. The code does not handle untrusted data in a security-sensitive manner, but given its purpose, this is expected. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for constrained float generation with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores should reflect this benign nature, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
