{
  "purpose": "Define protocols for data persistence (synchronous and asynchronous) and identify dataclass-like objects.",
  "sources": "Type hints, protocol class definitions, and class attributes",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external data handling evident",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code defines interfaces only",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; the code strictly defines protocols and type checks",
  "analysis": "The code uses Python typing and protocol classes to define interfaces for data persistence and a protocol for dataclasses. It imports standard modules and pydantic.BaseModel for type annotations. No data input, external calls, or data leaks are present. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns are found. The code appears to be a standard, safe implementation of protocol definitions for use in larger systems.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining interfaces without any executable or malicious content. There are no signs of malware or security risks. The code is safe and appears to serve as a foundation for data persistence protocols.",
