  "purpose": "Define protocols for data persistence operations, both synchronous and asynchronous, and a protocol for identifying dataclasses.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, protocol class definitions, and comments indicating protocol purposes.",
  "sinks": "No actual data handling, I/O, or external data sources; code is purely interface definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code consists of interface declarations with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. It is a standard protocol definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several Protocol classes for data persistence and dataclass identification using Python's typing and pydantic. It includes only interface specifications with no data processing, input/output, or external calls. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward definition of protocols for data persistence and dataclass recognition, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves as interface scaffolding without executable or data-handling logic.",
