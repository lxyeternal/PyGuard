{
  "purpose": "Defines Python Protocol classes for data persistence operations (sync and async) and a protocol for identifying dataclasses, serving as interface scaffolding.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code contains only class definitions and comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely structural definitions with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of protocol class definitions for persistence interfaces and dataclass identification, using standard Python typing and decorators. It contains no executable logic, data handling, external calls, or security-sensitive operations. The code is benign, serving as interface scaffolding. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of interface definitions with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
