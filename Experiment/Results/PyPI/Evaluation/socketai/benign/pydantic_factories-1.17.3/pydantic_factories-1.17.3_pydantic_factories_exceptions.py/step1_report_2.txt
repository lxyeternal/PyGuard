  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a model factory or configuration context.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, outputs, or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data or control flows involving untrusted sources or external data.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of class declarations for exception handling; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. All classes are simple pass-throughs with no additional logic, data manipulation, or external interactions. There are no hardcoded credentials, external data reads, network calls, or obfuscated code. The structure is straightforward and typical for error handling in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is unlikely to pose any security risk.",
