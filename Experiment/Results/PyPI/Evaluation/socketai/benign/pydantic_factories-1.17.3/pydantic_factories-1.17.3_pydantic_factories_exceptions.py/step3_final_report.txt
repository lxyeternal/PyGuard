{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in a model factory or configuration context.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception; no external data reads or dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external interactions; purely class declarations.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or external data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. No malicious, suspicious, or security-compromising elements are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the simplicity and purpose of the code. The high confidence scores reflect the clear and unambiguous nature of the code. No logical flaws or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of custom exception classes with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The current scores are justified and should remain at zero across all categories.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
