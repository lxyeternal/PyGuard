  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a model factory or configuration context.",
  "sources": "None (no input or external data read).",
  "sinks": "None (no output, data transmission, or external interaction).",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of multiple custom exception classes might be unusual if the context is simple, but this alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from built-in Exception and a base custom error. There are no suspicious or malicious code constructs, no external data reads, no data leaks, no dynamic execution, or network activity. The structure is typical for error handling in Python projects. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of custom exception classes intended for error handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign component of a larger application or library.",
