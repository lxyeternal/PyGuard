  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code only defines custom exception classes, with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic execution. There are no signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign, standard exception class definitions, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent. No logical errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which aligns with the analysis. The obfuscated score is also 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward class definitions. The confidence scores are high (1), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports conclude that the code is benign with no malicious or suspicious behavior, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The code is purely structural, serving as exception class definitions.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is correctly 0 across all reports. No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, sticking to observable facts: the code only defines classes, with no external interactions or suspicious constructs.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are thorough and accurate. The code is safe, with no security concerns.",
