  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a model factory context.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance declarations.",
  "sinks": "None; no data handling, input/output, or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow between sources and sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from a custom exception base class; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes intended for specific error scenarios, all inheriting from a common base exception. The structure appears standard for Python error handling. No external data sources, no processing, and no dynamic code execution are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, suspicious data flows, or anomalies. Overall, it appears safe.",
