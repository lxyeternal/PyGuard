  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is purely class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - No external data, dynamic code, or malicious payloads are detected.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for error handling in Python projects.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that there are no suspicious behaviors.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The assessments are thorough and cautious, correctly dismissing any security concerns.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the code content.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:\n   - Since the code is benign, higher scores are unwarranted.\n   - The reports' conservative scoring (0) is justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - No malicious activity is indicated or implied.\n   - The code does not perform any external interactions or contain obfuscated logic.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n   - No unwarranted security risks are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The high confidence levels (1.0) reflect the thoroughness and agreement across reports.\n\n**Final Evaluation**:\n- The code is a benign, straightforward set of exception class definitions.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n**My Own Estimates**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores are justified and should remain at zero across all categories.",
