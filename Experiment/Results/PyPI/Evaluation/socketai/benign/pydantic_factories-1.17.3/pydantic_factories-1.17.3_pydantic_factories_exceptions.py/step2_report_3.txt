  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The code appears standard for error handling in Python projects.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues found.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Correct; straightforward exception classes.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Correct; simple class definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Correct; standard exception hierarchy.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final thoughts:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; malware score should remain 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; should stay at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Since all reports confirm the code is benign and straightforward, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no security concerns. The reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate.",
