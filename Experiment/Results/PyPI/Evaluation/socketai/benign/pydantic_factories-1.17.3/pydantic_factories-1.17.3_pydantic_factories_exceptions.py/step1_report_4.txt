  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to model factory operations.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, storage, or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; code solely defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions inheriting from a base exception class. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious constructs are present. It appears to be a standard setup for custom exceptions in a Python project, with no indicators of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of custom exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
