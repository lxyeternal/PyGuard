  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a model factory module.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard class inheritance for exceptions with no additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Exception and each other. It does not include any data input, output, or external communication. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation techniques. The code appears to be a typical exception hierarchy used for error handling in a larger application, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard definition of custom exceptions for a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and appears to serve purely as error class declarations.",
