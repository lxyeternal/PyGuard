  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from `Exception`. There are no external data reads, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no obfuscation.\n   - The reports correctly identify that these are benign, standard exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or inaccuracies are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions with no external interactions or malicious constructs, a risk score above 0.5 would be unwarranted.\n   - The current scores of 0 or 0.0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports, reflecting the absence of malicious intent or payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they stick to factual analysis based on the code content.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward, benign set of custom exception class definitions.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Own Estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a standard, safe component of a larger Python project, serving only to define custom exceptions for error handling.",
