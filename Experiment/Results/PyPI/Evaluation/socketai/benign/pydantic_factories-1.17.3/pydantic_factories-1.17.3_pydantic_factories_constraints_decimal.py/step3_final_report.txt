  "purpose": "Validation of decimal constraints and generation of constrained decimal numbers with length adjustments.",
  "sources": "Input parameters (max_digits, decimal_places, minimum, maximum), external functions (generate_constrained_number, create_random_decimal, get_constrained_number_range).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data leaks or external system calls.",
  "flows": "Validation functions check parameters; generate_constrained_number produces a decimal; handle_decimal_length adjusts decimal length via string manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string slicing for decimal truncation is standard; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation of decimal constraints, generates constrained decimals via external functions, and adjusts decimal length through string operations. No external system calls, network activity, or data leaks are present. External functions are assumed safe; no obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The logic is straightforward and adheres to common practices for decimal handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for decimal validation and constrained number generation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. External dependencies should be reviewed for trustworthiness, but based on the code alone, the supply chain appears secure.",
