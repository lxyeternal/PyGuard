  "purpose": "Utility functions for Pydantic models, dataclasses, and type validation, including model creation, type checks, and validation helpers.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class metadata, dataclass fields, model fields, input parameters for validation functions.",
  "sinks": "None; internal data structures and model fields are manipulated, no external data output or system interaction.",
  "flows": "Type info and class metadata flow into validation and model creation functions; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard utility functions for handling Pydantic models and dataclasses, performing type checks, dynamic model creation, and validation. It operates solely on static data, class metadata, and type annotations, with no external system interaction, network activity, or obfuscation. The functions modify model fields in a controlled manner, and the logic aligns with typical data validation and model handling practices. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for data modeling and validation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The overall security posture is very low risk, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
