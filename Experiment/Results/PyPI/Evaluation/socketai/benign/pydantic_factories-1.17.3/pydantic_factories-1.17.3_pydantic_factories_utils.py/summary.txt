  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for data modeling and validation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The overall security posture is very low risk, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
