  "purpose": "Utility classes for wrapping callables, fixtures, post-generation hooks, and markers within a factory or data generation framework.",
  "sources": "User-supplied functions, external plugin registry (`FactoryFixture.factory_class_map`), and external modules.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of stored callables in `to_value()` methods, access to external factory class map.",
  "flows": "From input functions and external registry to callable invocation and factory methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. The code executes user-provided callables, which is typical but could be risky if untrusted functions are supplied.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes (`Use`, `PostGenerated`, `Fixture`, `Require`, `Ignore`) that facilitate data generation and testing workflows. The primary security consideration is the invocation of user-supplied functions within `to_value()` methods, which is standard in such frameworks but inherently carries execution risks if untrusted code is provided. The external access to `FactoryFixture.factory_class_map` is typical for plugin architectures but could be manipulated if compromised. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected. The import statements and class structures are standard, and the functions are invoked in a controlled manner. Overall, the code is a legitimate utility module for factory-based data generation, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility for managing callables and fixtures in a factory framework. It executes user functions as part of its normal operation but does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The security risk is low and inherent to the framework's design, not indicative of malicious intent.",
