  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility for managing callables and fixtures in a factory framework. It executes user functions as part of its normal operation but does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The security risk is low and inherent to the framework's design, not indicative of malicious intent."
