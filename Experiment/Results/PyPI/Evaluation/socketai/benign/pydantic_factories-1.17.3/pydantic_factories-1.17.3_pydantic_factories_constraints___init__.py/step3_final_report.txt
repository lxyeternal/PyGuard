  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "No code provided; no data input or external sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external network connections, or sensitive data access observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows detected due to absence of code.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of code or content; no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly note the absence of code, leading to low or zero malware, obfuscation, and risk scores. Report 3 describes a benign script with high confidence but no evidence of malicious activity, justifying low risk. The scores are consistent with the lack of suspicious behavior or obfuscation. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The assessments are appropriate and cautious, reflecting the available information.",
  "conclusion": "The reports accurately reflect the absence of code and malicious intent, with scores aligned to the evidence. No further action or adjustment is necessary given the current data.",
