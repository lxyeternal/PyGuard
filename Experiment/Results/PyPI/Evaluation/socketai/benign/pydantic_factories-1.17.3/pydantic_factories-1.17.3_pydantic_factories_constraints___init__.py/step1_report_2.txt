  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is empty; no operations, data handling, or logic are present. Lack of content makes analysis difficult, but no suspicious or unusual activity is observable.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment is entirely empty, containing no functions, variables, imports, or logic. Due to the absence of content, there are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. The emptiness itself does not indicate malicious intent but also provides no evidence of malicious activity. As such, this could be an incomplete file or a placeholder with no executable code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is essentially empty, offering no functional or security concerns but also no meaningful analysis possible.",
