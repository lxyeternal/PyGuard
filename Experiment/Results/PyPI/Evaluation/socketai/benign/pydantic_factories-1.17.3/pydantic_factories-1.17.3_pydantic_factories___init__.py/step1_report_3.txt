{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various classes and functions related to data modeling, persistence, and protocols, and then defines an explicit public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.exceptions, .extensions, .factory, .fields, .protocols)",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks; no network or file operations present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are only imports and an __all__ declaration with no data flow logic",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of import statements and a list defining the module's public interface. No user input handling, data processing, or external communication is present. The imported modules and classes are likely part of a larger data modeling or ORM framework, but their use here appears standard and non-malicious. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward module that imports and exposes various classes and protocols. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code fragment. It serves as an organizational or interface file without executing untrusted code or performing dangerous operations.",
