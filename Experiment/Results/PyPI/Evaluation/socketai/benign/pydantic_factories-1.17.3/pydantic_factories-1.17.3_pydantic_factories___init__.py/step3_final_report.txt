  "purpose": "Organize and expose internal classes and functions related to persistence protocols, data models, and fields for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules (.exceptions, .extensions, .factory, .fields, .protocols).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only imports and defines __all__, with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and static, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module that imports specific classes and functions from internal modules and defines an __all__ list for public API exposure. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation. The absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads indicates a benign purpose. All reports correctly identify this as a simple organizational module with no security risks. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score 0, reflecting the benign nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the static and transparent structure of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module serving as an interface for a data modeling and persistence framework. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are justified and should remain as is.",
