{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports a set of classes, protocols, and exceptions related to data models and persistence layers, likely for a data handling library or framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules such as .exceptions, .extensions, .factory, .fields, and .protocols.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static and from local modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly re-exports classes and constants from internal modules, serving as an interface or API layer. There are no input processing, no dynamic code execution, and no network or file system interactions. It appears to be a straightforward module definition with standard Python syntax. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export file, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply consolidates and exposes components for external use.",
