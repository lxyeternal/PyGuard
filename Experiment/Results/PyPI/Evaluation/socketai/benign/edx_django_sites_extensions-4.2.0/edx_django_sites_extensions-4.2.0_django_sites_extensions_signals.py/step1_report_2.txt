  "purpose": "Set up signals in a Django application to clear redirect cache entries when Redirect model instances are saved or deleted.",
  "sources": "Reading from Django settings (INSTALLED_APPS, REDIRECT_CACHE_KEY_PREFIX), importing the Redirect model, signal triggers post_delete and post_save.",
  "sinks": "Calling cache.delete() to remove cache entries based on a constructed cache key.",
  "flows": "Signals (post_save, post_delete) trigger clear_redirect_cache, which constructs a cache key from settings and instance data, then deletes that cache key.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code handles conditional import and signal registration safely. No external network activity or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports the Redirect model based on installed apps to prevent errors. Signal receivers clear cache entries related to redirect instances by forming cache keys using configuration and model data. The approach appears standard for cache invalidation in Django. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The logic is straightforward, and no obfuscation or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django signal handler setup for cache invalidation tied to the Redirect model. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected; it performs a benign cache clearing operation based on model signals.",
