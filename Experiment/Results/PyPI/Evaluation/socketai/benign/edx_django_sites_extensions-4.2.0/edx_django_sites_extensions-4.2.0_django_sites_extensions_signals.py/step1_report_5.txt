{
  "purpose": "This code sets up signal handlers in a Django application to clear the cache related to redirects when Redirect model instances are saved or deleted.",
  "sources": "Reads from Django settings (settings.INSTALLED_APPS, settings.REDIRECT_CACHE_KEY_PREFIX), and from the Redirect model when the app is installed.",
  "sinks": "Deletes cache entries using django.core.cache.cache.delete() based on a generated cache key.",
  "flows": "On save or delete of a Redirect instance, constructs a cache key using the site's domain and deletes that cache entry.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code dynamically checks app installation to avoid errors. Uses standard Django signal handling and cache deletion.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard signal registration in Django to clear cache entries when redirect objects are modified. It conditionally imports models only if the app is installed, reducing startup errors. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network activity are present. The use of cache.delete() appears straightforward. Overall, the logic aligns with typical Django cache invalidation patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cache invalidation signals for Django redirects. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for cache management with appropriate conditional checks.",
