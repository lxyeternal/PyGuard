{
  "purpose": "This code sets up signal handlers in a Django project to clear redirect-related cache entries when Redirect model instances are created, updated, or deleted.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Django settings (settings.INSTALLED_APPS, settings.REDIRECT_CACHE_KEY_PREFIX), and the Redirect model data (instance.site.domain).",
  "sinks": "The cache.delete method is called with a cache key constructed from the prefix and the redirect's site domain.",
  "flows": "When a Redirect instance is saved or deleted, the signal triggers, constructing a cache key from the instance data and deleting the corresponding cache entry.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets are present. The conditional import avoids errors if the 'django.contrib.redirects' app is absent. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly sets up signals conditioned on app installation, preventing errors. It constructs cache keys dynamically based on site domain, which is standard practice. The cache deletion appears safe and intended for cache consistency. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent identified. It relies on standard Django mechanisms and safe string formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cache invalidation in response to model changes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks detected. The code appears safe and well-structured.",
