{
  "purpose": "The code sets up Django signal handlers to invalidate redirect cache entries when Redirect objects are saved or deleted, ensuring cache consistency.",
  "sources": "The signal handlers are triggered by post_save and post_delete events on the Redirect model; they access 'instance.site.domain' and 'settings.REDIRECT_CACHE_KEY_PREFIX' to construct cache keys.",
  "sinks": "The cache.delete(cache_key) call removes cache entries based on the constructed key, potentially affecting cache state if misused, but in this context, it is safe.",
  "flows": "On save or delete of a Redirect instance, the signal handler constructs a cache key from a prefix and the redirect's site domain, then deletes that cache entry.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward. Potential minor concern if 'instance.site' or 'domain' are manipulated, but standard in Django models.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports the Redirect model based on app installation, sets up signal handlers for cache invalidation, and constructs cache keys from settings and model data. It performs standard cache clearing without any malicious or suspicious logic. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The reliance on external configuration and model attributes is typical and does not introduce security issues. Overall, the code is a safe, standard pattern for cache invalidation tied to Django signals.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django cache invalidation pattern triggered by redirect model signals. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
