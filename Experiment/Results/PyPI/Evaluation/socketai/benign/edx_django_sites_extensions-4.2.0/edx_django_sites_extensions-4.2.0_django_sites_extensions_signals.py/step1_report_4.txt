  "purpose": "Setup signal handlers in a Django application to clear redirect cache entries when Redirect models are saved or deleted.",
  "sources": "Reads from settings.INSTALLED_APPS, settings.REDIRECT_CACHE_KEY_PREFIX, and instance.site.domain.",
  "sinks": "cache.delete(cache_key) which potentially clears cache entries based on dynamic keys.",
  "flows": "Reads configuration and model data -> constructs cache key -> deletes cache entry.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic cache key construction, but no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behavior observed. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports and connects signal handlers to the Redirect model only if the app is installed. The handler clears cache entries associated with redirect URLs, which is standard cache management practice. No untrusted input is processed insecurely, and no data leakage or malicious activity is evident. The only potential concern is reliance on external configuration and assumptions about the safety of cache keys, but this is standard in Django apps.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard Django signal handling for cache invalidation tied to Redirect model updates. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be well-structured and safe.",
