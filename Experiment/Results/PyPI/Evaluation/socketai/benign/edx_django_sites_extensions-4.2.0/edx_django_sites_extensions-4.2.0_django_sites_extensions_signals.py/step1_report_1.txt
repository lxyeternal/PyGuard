{
  "purpose": "The code sets up Django signal handlers to clear cache entries related to redirects whenever a Redirect object is saved or deleted.",
  "sources": "The code reads the installed apps list from settings, and accesses instance.site.domain and settings.REDIRECT_CACHE_KEY_PREFIX during cache key construction.",
  "sinks": "The cache.delete() method is called to remove cache entries based on constructed cache keys.",
  "flows": "On post_save or post_delete signals for Redirect, the code constructs a cache key using settings and instance data, then deletes that cache entry.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated logic present. The code relies on the presence of a specific app and certain settings; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports the Redirect model only if the app is installed, which prevents import errors. Signal handlers are correctly decorated to respond to save and delete events. Cache key construction uses a prefix and the domain from the Redirect instance's site, indicating expected cache management behavior. No malicious activity or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears straightforward and aligned with typical Django patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of Django signal handlers for cache invalidation related to redirects. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It safely manages cache clearing tied to redirect model changes.",
