  "purpose": "Define application configuration for the django_sites_extensions Django app",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django modules and internal models and signals",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no external data output or untrusted data processing",
  "flows": "Imports occur at module load time; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The 'ready' method only imports modules without executing additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django AppConfig subclass defining the app's configuration. The 'ready' method imports models and signals, which is a typical pattern to ensure models and signals are registered at startup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The imports are static and do not involve dynamic execution or external data fetching.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django application configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical setup procedures for Django apps without any suspicious behavior.",
