  "purpose": "Configure a Django application by setting app metadata and initializing models and signals during startup.",
  "sources": "Static import statements within the 'ready()' method importing 'models' and 'signals' from the same package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "flows": "Import statements executed during app startup, with no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; comments disabling pylint are benign; code follows standard Django patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with a 'ready()' method that imports local modules for models and signals. This pattern is common for initializing app components. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or secrets are present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The import pattern is standard practice to avoid circular dependencies. All reports correctly assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk scores (~0 or 0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django application configuration with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores and assessments across reports are justified and accurate. No adjustments are necessary.",
