  "purpose": "Django middleware for handling URL redirects based on stored redirect rules.",
  "sources": "Request object (request), Django cache, Redirect model query (Redirect.objects.filter).",
  "sinks": "redirect() function call (potential HTTP redirect), cache.set (storing redirects).",
  "flows": "Request path is used to look up redirect URL; redirect URL is returned as an HTTP redirect response.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation present. Usage of cache for redirect data is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a middleware that caches redirect mappings from the database to optimize URL redirection performance. It retrieves redirect data from cache or database, then issues an HTTP redirect if a match is found. No malicious code, data leaks, or malicious behavior is detected. It relies on standard Django practices and does not involve untrusted data processing beyond URL matching.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard URL redirect middleware with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It efficiently caches redirect rules and performs redirects based on stored data, with no indications of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
