  "purpose": "Django middleware for URL redirects, caching redirect mappings for efficiency.",
  "sources": "Request URL path (request.path), database query on Redirect model, cache retrieval and storage.",
  "sinks": "Redirect function (performs URL redirection), cache.set (stores redirect mappings).",
  "flows": "Request URL -> cache lookup -> database query if cache miss -> cache set -> redirect if match found.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard Django components and practices; no hardcoded secrets or external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward redirect middleware that caches redirect mappings to optimize performance. It queries the database only on cache misses, then caches the results. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The logic is clear, uses standard Django functions, and handles data securely assuming proper configuration. No signs of code injection, data leaks, or external malicious activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Django middleware for URL redirects with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score assigned in some reports (0.1) is justified as a cautious estimate but does not reflect actual vulnerabilities. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
