  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described logic with the original code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Accurately describes the code as a standard redirect middleware that caches redirect rules and performs redirects. No suspicious activity or malicious behavior noted.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward, uses Django's standard mechanisms, and no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirms straightforward redirect handling with caching, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code and the previous report. No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, describes standard redirect middleware, emphasizes safe use of cache and database, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** The slight increase in securityRisk (0.1) seems to reflect a cautious stance on cache usage, but given the code's simplicity and lack of external data handling beyond standard Django functions, this is acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No adjustment necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, confirms standard pattern, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code and previous assessments.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, describes standard redirect logic, no malicious behavior, standard Django practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Score:** The majority report assigns 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Slight caution due to cache usage, but overall very low risk.\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured middleware component with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The minor risk score reflects cautious acknowledgment of caching but does not indicate a real vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis above.",
