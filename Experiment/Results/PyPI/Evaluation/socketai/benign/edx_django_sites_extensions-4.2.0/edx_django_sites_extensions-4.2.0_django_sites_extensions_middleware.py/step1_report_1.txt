  "purpose": "Django middleware for handling URL redirects based on stored redirect rules in the Open edX platform.",
  "sources": "Reads request data such as request.site and request.path; accesses settings for cache key prefix and timeout; queries Redirect model from database.",
  "sinks": "Uses Django's redirect function to redirect HTTP requests; reads from cache to retrieve redirect mappings.",
  "flows": "Request data (site, path) -> Cache retrieval or database query for redirects -> Redirect response if a matching redirect is found.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated behavior observed. Uses standard Django caching and redirect mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a typical redirect middleware, caching redirect rules for efficiency. It retrieves redirect mappings from the database, caches them, and performs redirects as appropriate. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious data leaks or external connections, and no hidden backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured middleware component for URL redirects with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It functions as intended within the framework of Django and Open edX without introducing security risks.",
