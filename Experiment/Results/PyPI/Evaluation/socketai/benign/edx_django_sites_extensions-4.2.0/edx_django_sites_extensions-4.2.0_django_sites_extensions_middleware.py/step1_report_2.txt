  "purpose": "Middleware for handling URL redirects in a Django-based Open edX environment.",
  "sources": "Reads request data (request.site, request.path), reads settings (settings.REDIRECT_CACHE_KEY_PREFIX, settings.REDIRECT_CACHE_TIMEOUT), queries database (Redirect.objects.filter).",
  "sinks": "Uses redirect() to redirect HTTP requests based on cached or database-provided URLs.",
  "flows": "Request data (site, path) → cache retrieval or database query → redirect() if match found.",
  "anomalies": "None apparent; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious external calls, no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django middleware that retrieves redirect mappings from cache or database and redirects requests accordingly. It uses standard Django functions and models, with no dynamic code execution or external network calls. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. The cache is properly used to optimize database access. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as intended for URL redirection and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured middleware component with no malicious intent.",
