  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of a module-level version string assignment (`__version__ = '4.2.0'`).\n   - There are no input/output operations, data processing, external interactions, or obfuscated/malicious code segments.\n   - The code is minimal and typical for a package's version declaration.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**:\n   - All reports explicitly state that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or contain embedded malware.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment; no logical flaws or errors are identified.\n   - The purpose is straightforward: defining the version of the module.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty based on the minimal and benign code.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - No assumptions are made beyond the code snippet provided.\n   - Since the code is static and simple, there's no basis for suspecting hidden malicious intent.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment**:\n- The code snippet is a straightforward version declaration.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n- The code is benign, and the risk is effectively zero.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThese reflect the total absence of any malicious or suspicious activity in the code snippet.",
