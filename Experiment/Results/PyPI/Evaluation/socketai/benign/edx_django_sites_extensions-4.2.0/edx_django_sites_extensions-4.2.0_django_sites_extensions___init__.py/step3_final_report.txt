  "purpose": "Declare the version of the module for identification and compatibility purposes.",
  "sources": "No data sources; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only a static variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple, straightforward version string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a module-level docstring and a version string assignment. It contains no input/output, data processing, dynamic code, or obfuscation. All reports confirm the absence of malicious behavior, suspicious constructs, or embedded code. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the benign and minimal nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
