  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the edx-django-sites-extensions package, including requirements loading, version extraction, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "File reads from 'README.rst', requirement files specified in load_requirements, and the version file '__init__.py'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is used directly in sensitive operations like system commands, network communication, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Requirement lines are read from files and processed into requirement strings. Version string is extracted from a file and used in setup. No external data flows into insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard setup script with some comments about updates via semgrep; no obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. The regex-based requirement parsing is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks: reading README for long description, parsing requirements with constraints, extracting version info from a file, and defining package metadata. No use of eval, exec, or insecure handling of data. Requirements are read from files, but there is no evidence of malicious input handling or malicious code execution. All functions operate on file data without executing untrusted code or network activities. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward and appears intended solely for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles file I/O and requirement parsing safely. No malware or obfuscation detected. Overall security risk is minimal.",
