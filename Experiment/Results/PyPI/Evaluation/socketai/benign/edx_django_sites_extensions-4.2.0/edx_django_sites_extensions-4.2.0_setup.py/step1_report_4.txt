  "sources": "File reads for 'README.rst', requirement files, and version extraction from '__init__.py'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that execute untrusted data; setup parameters are static and controlled.",
  "flows": "File reading flows from disk to variables, with no external data sources or sinks that process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package metadata, reads requirements files, and extracts version info. It uses regex for parsing requirements and version strings. No code injection, external network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The requirement loading includes handling of constraints and validation of package names. No obfuscated code or obfuscated language features are present. All functions perform straightforward file operations and data processing. There are no signs of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, performing typical package configuration tasks. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The script reads package info and requirements securely and transparently. Overall, it appears safe with no security concerns.",
