  "purpose": "Setup script for the edx-django-sites-extensions package, handling metadata, requirements, and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst, requirements files, and version info from __init__.py.",
  "sinks": "None; static file reading and regex parsing without executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Reads files, parses requirement lines with regex, extracts version, and configures setuptools.",
  "anomalies": "Comments about automated modifications (semgrep) but no malicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script performing static file reads, regex parsing for requirements and version, and package configuration. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data beyond file I/O. The regex parsing is straightforward, and comments about semgrep are benign. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code's behavior aligns with typical package setup scripts, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and conservative.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The scores are justified and consistent with its functionality.",
