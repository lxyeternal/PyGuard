  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'stytch' library, reading version info, README, and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'stytch/version.py' via regex, reads README.md for description",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data handling",
  "flows": "Reads version and README, then passes static data to setup() without dynamic execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard setup code with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports standard modules, reads local files for version and description, and calls setuptools.setup() with package info. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle user input. The regex used for version extraction is common and safe. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are present. The dependency list is standard, and no secrets or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, standard packaging process. Minor conservative security risk score in some reports (0.1) is acceptable but unnecessary; the overall risk is effectively zero.",
