{
  "purpose": "This script is used for setting up and configuring the Python package 'stytch' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file, reads version from stytch/version.py, and uses find_packages to identify package modules.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function and its parameters, which could potentially execute code during installation if malicious code is embedded.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md and version file, then passing data to setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward, with standard setup procedures. No hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads files to gather package metadata, and invokes setuptools.setup() with defined parameters. All operations are typical for a Python package setup script. No external data or user inputs are processed at runtime, and there are no code injections, network calls, or suspicious behaviors detected. The version extraction via regex is safe, given the file's controlled context. The code's structure and logic are clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It performs typical operations such as reading metadata and invoking setuptools without executing or evaluating untrusted code or inputs. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
