{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'stytch', used to configure package metadata, dependencies, and packaging information for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file, reads version information from stytch/version.py, and processes package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the script primarily sets up package configuration. No untrusted data execution occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads version data from a file (source) and uses it in setup() (sink), with no untrusted data manipulation or external command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The use of regular expressions to parse version info is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup procedures: reading documentation, extracting version info, and configuring package parameters. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious code pathways identified. It imports only standard and well-known libraries (pathlib, re, setuptools). All operations are related to packaging and distribution setup. The version parsing from a file using regex is standard practice. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no suspicious network activity, and no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious or anomalous code behavior, and no security risks are apparent. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python packaging conventions.",
