{
  "purpose": "This script is used for configuring the packaging and distribution of the Python project 'stytch'.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file, reads the version number from stytch/version.py, and input parameters for setup() such as package data and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "The script does not contain any sinks that handle untrusted data or perform external system actions.",
  "flows": "Reads version information from a local file; uses that information in the setup() call. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code follows standard setup script conventions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing necessary modules and reads the README file for long description. It then extracts the package version from a local file using regex. It verifies that the version is found, then proceeds to call setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and package data. All operations are standard for a Python package setup script. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code, and no suspicious data handling occurs. The code strictly manages package metadata and dependencies, with no network connections or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected operations for packaging a Python library, with no signs of malicious or sabotage activities.",
