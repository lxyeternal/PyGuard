  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no malicious code, standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign, no issues detected. The reasoning aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Same as Report 1, standard setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports; standard setup script, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** No issues, aligns with the code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard setup, with a note that reading version info via regex is common.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1). The only point of note is the regex parsing of version info, which is a common practice and not inherently risky. No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard setup, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code does not perform any network activity, code injection, or other malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is present; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** The only minor point is the regex parsing of version info, which is a standard practice and not risky. Assigning a very low security risk (0.1) seems reasonable, but even this is marginal.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The **malware scores** across all reports are justified as 0.0.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are justified as 0.0.\n- The **security risk scores** should remain very low, around 0.0 to 0.1, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- The code uses standard libraries and practices for a setup script.\n- The regex for version extraction, while sometimes risky if not controlled, is standard here and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimate:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| **0.0**        | **0.0**            | **0.0**  |\n\nThis reflects the benign, standard nature of the code, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
