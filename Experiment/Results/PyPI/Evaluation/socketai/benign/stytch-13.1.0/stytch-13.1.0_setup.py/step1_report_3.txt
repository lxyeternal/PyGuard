{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'stytch', preparing it for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads 'stytch/version.py' to extract the package version; source of input is file I/O operations.",
  "sinks": "Uses setuptools.setup() to configure package distribution, which does not directly handle untrusted input; no malicious sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Reads version string from version.py file, then passes all metadata and dependencies to setup() for package build and distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code performs standard package setup tasks; no unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the package version from a local file and the README for documentation, then calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed in a risky manner. No suspicious code, obfuscated segments, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It securely reads necessary metadata and dependencies for packaging purposes without any malicious behaviors.",
