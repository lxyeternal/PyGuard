  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'stytch'. It automates package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the version number from 'stytch/version.py' and reads the content of 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the script only handles package setup and does not process untrusted data for execution.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file (source) and uses it in setup parameters (sink); reads README content for description (source).",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of 're' for version parsing is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: importing modules, reading package metadata, and configuring dependencies. It securely reads version info from a specific file with a regex, and then proceeds with setup() call. There is no dynamic execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted inputs. The code appears to follow best practices for package setup, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
