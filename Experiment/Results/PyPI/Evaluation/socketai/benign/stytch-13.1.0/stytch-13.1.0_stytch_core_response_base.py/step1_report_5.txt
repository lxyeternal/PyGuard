  "purpose": "Define data models and error handling for API response processing, including parsing JSON responses and categorizing errors.",
  "sources": "Input JSON data in the from_json class method, error details in exception handling.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of data models from JSON, raising exceptions with error details.",
  "flows": "from_json method reads JSON; depending on status code, it either returns a model instance or raises an exception with error details.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors. Usage of try-except blocks appears standard for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles parsing JSON responses into data models, with error handling for different response scenarios. It uses pydantic for data validation and exception classes for error propagation. No external input is directly executed, and no network or system operations are performed. The data flow is straightforward, with clear source-to-sink paths. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard API response handler with robust error management. No malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. It appears safe and legitimate.",
