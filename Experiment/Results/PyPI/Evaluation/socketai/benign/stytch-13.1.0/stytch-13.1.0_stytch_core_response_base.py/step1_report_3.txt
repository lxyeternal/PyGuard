{
  "purpose": "Defines data models and error handling for processing API responses, including parsing JSON responses and handling error details.",
  "sources": "Input JSON data received from API responses; status_code parameter passed to from_json method.",
  "sinks": "Potential raising of exceptions and property evaluations based on status_code; no data leaks or external calls evident.",
  "flows": "from_json method reads JSON input, processes error conditions, and may raise exceptions; property methods evaluate status_code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic aliasing in pydantic fields is legitimate; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles API response parsing and error encapsulation using pydantic models. It includes error handling for response status codes, and custom exceptions. No external network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is observed. The use of dynamic aliasing in pydantic is safe and intended for flexible JSON parsing. The logic is straightforward, with exception handling based on response codes. No suspicious code or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of API response parsing and error management. No malicious or sabotage behavior is detected. The code is secure and well-structured for its purpose.",
