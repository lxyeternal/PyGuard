{
  "purpose": "This code defines data models and error handling mechanisms for processing API responses, particularly handling success and error responses from an external service.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from JSON objects passed to from_json() methods, and error details are created based on response status codes and JSON content.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs exception objects (StytchError) from error details, which could be raised to signal errors. No direct output or untrusted data handling other than exception creation is present.",
  "flows": "Input JSON is parsed into data models, and errors with specific JSON structures are converted into exceptions; error details can include arbitrary JSON, but no unsafe data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic aliasing with validation_alias in pydantic fields; error handling avoids re-raising exceptions that could contain untrusted JSON. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly uses pydantic for data validation and constructs error objects based on response status codes. Error handling includes fallback mechanisms for unknown errors. No malicious behavior or malicious code patterns are present. No unsafe data handling or code injection points are identified. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured API response handler.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API response handling module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It employs safe practices for data parsing and error management. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
