  "purpose": "Define response and error handling models for API responses using pydantic, including error parsing and classification.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'json', 'status_code' in from_json and from_unknown methods, class properties, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions, creating error detail objects, property evaluations.",
  "flows": "from_json method reads JSON input, evaluates status_code, potentially raises exceptions with error details; error details are constructed from JSON or defaults.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pydantic for data validation; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The code models API responses and error handling using pydantic models. The from_json method conditionally raises custom exceptions based on status codes, parsing error details from JSON. Error details include optional error type, message, URL, and original JSON data. Error handling is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious network activity. The code’s structure is typical for API client models, with no suspicious anomalies or obfuscation. The error details are safely constructed, and no untrusted inputs are processed in a harmful manner.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard API response and error handling models with pydantic, without any malicious or suspicious activity. It is well-structured, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
