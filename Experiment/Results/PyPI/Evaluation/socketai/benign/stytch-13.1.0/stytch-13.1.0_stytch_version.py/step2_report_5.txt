  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code step-by-step.\n\n1. **Code Content:**\n```python\n__version__ = \"13.1.0\"\n```\nThis is a minimal, standard assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable, commonly used in Python packages for versioning.\n\n2. **Review of Each Report:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple, benign version declaration.\n- No input/output operations, data flows, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating certainty in their assessments.\n\n3. **Assessment of Scores:**\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency & Potential Issues:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is standard practice for versioning and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- No changes needed in the scoring or reasoning.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n- The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as a simple, harmless version string assignment.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The malware score is correctly 0 because there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 because the code is straightforward.\n- The risk score is 0, as there's no security risk involved.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard version declaration with no security implications.",
