  "flows": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; only version string assignment without any suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to the __version__ attribute, which is standard practice in Python packages for version identification. There are no inputs, outputs, or complex logic present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The code is straightforward and typical for package version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as a version identifier, and shows no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
