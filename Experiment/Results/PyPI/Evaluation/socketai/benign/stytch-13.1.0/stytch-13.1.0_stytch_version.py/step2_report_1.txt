  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is simply assigning a string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external calls.\n   - The code is minimal, standard practice for package versioning.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No report indicates any suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - The code does not perform any data handling, network communication, or dynamic execution.\n   - No anomalies or signs of malicious constructs are identified.\n\n3. **Assessment of Scores:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and the lack of any suspicious activity, these scores are appropriate.\n   - The confidence level is 1 in all reports, which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n   - No flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports’ reasoning.\n   - The conclusions are consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - No assumptions are made that could lead to false positives.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a standard version declaration.\n   - There is no indication of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n   - The scores are reasonable and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Remain at 0. — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Remain at 0. — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Remain at 0. — No security concerns.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The scores and analysis are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- No adjustments are necessary based on the current evidence.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is benign, standard version declaration, with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
