  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable for package versioning.",
  "sources": "No input or external data; the code is a direct assignment statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a simple assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no inputs, outputs, or external calls. All reviews confirm its benign nature. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No logical flaws or assumptions are evident. The code aligns with common practices for package versioning and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks or malicious intent. The existing scores are accurate and justified.",
