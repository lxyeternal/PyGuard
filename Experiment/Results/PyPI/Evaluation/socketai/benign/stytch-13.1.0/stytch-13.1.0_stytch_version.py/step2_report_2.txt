  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is simply `__version__ = \"13.1.0\"`.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data flows, or external calls.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all assessments agree on zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and the code is a standard version string assignment, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscation, so the risk scores are correctly low.\n\n5. **Malware Score Evaluation:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code is a simple version string assignment with no malicious intent.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are cautious and based on observable code behavior.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Expert Estimate:\nGiven the simplicity of the code, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and reflects the benign nature of the code snippet.",
