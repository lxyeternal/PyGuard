{
  "purpose": "The code defines an abstract base class for a client interacting with the Stytch API, managing API URLs, and JWT key retrieval setup.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from constructor parameters such as project_id, secret, environment, and optional async_session and fraud_environment.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data directly, as secrets are used internally, and environment variables are used only for URL configuration.",
  "flows": "Constructor initializes API URLs and clients based on input parameters; no external data flows or untrusted sources beyond configuration inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code uses standard library and well-known third-party modules without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up an API client with configurable environment URLs and JWT key client initialization. There are no signs of malicious data handling, code injection, or secret leaks. The use of warnings for 'test' environment is standard practice. The abstract method get_jwks_client indicates expected subclasses to implement JWT key retrieval securely. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, with no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities. It performs typical API client setup functions securely and transparently.",
