{
  "purpose": "The code defines an abstract base class for a client interacting with the Stytch API, managing API URLs, session clients, and JWT key clients.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters: project_id, secret, environment, suppress_warnings, async_session, fraud_environment.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include usage of project_id, secret, environment variables, and JWT client initialization, which could lead to sensitive data exposure if mishandled.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (project_id, secret, environment, fraud_environment) flow into URL resolution, session client setup, and JWT client initialization, but no untrusted data flows directly into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code uses warnings for non-production environments, which is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a client framework for API interaction, with configurable environments and session management. It uses standard practices for environment URL resolution, warnings, and JWT client setup. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present. Sensitive data such as 'secret' is used in client initialization but is typical for API client credentials. No external or malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured API client base class with no malicious intent or security risks. It handles configuration and setup without suspicious or malicious code segments.",
