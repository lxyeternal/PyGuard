{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for clients interacting with the Stytch API, handling environment setup and JWKS client initialization.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as project_id, secret, environment, and optional aiohttp session; method get_jwks_client invoked during initialization.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks like network or file operations within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input parameters used for URL generation and client initialization; no evident malicious flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; environment URL handling is standard; no suspicious behavior or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an API client base with environment URL determination, session management, and JWKS client fetching via an abstract method. It manages environment warnings and constructs client objects securely without hardcoded secrets. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected. The code appears to be standard infrastructure setup for an API client.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup for an API client class with environment management and dependency initialization. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
