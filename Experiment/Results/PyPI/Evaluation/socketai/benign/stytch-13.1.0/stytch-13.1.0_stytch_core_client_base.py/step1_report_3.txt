  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for a client interacting with the Stytch API, managing environment URLs, API base URLs, and JWKS client initialization.",
  "sources": "Initialization of URLs, environment variables, and import statements",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is being directly output or used insecurely",
  "flows": "Initialization data flows into API base URL setup and JWKS client creation (abstract method, implementation-dependent)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious data; no unusual code behavior; warning about non-production environment is benign",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class with methods to determine environment URLs and initialize API clients. No sensitive data is hardcoded, and there are no network connections or data exfiltration points within this snippet. The use of warnings for non-production environments is standard practice. The abstract method for obtaining a JWKS client defers implementation, but this is not inherently suspicious. Overall, the code appears to be standard SDK setup code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK base class setup with environment configuration and API client initialization. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected; it appears safe and aligned with standard API client design.",
