  "purpose": "Abstract base class for API client setup, managing environment URLs, JWT client, and session clients.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters (project_id, secret, environment, fraud_environment), environment URL resolution, JWT client initialization.",
  "sinks": "Client initialization with secrets, environment URL assignment, JWT client setup.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> URL resolution / environment setup -> client objects (sync, async, JWT).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; benign warnings for non-production environments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK base class, with no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. It manages environment URLs, initializes clients with secrets, and sets up JWT clients via an abstract method. No untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks; the logic is standard and safe. The warnings are benign, and no obfuscation or malicious network activity is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk ~0.1-0.2) are slightly conservative but appropriate given the context. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign SDK setup class with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent and appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly marked as 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2). No improvements are necessary.",
