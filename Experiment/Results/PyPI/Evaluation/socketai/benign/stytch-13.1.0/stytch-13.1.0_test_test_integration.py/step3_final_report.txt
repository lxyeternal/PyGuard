{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for various API endpoints of a client SDK, validating authentication, user management, sessions, OTP, and other features using predefined test constants.",
  "sources": "Test constants, API response objects, and test setup modules.",
  "sinks": "API calls with sensitive data such as signatures, tokens, user IDs, emails, and session tokens.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static test constants and mock responses into API method calls; no untrusted or dynamic data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and primarily for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of structured unit and integration tests that invoke API endpoints with test data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network communications beyond API calls. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present. The use of test constants and dummy data aligns with standard testing practices. The malware score is therefore 0, as no malicious intent or activity is evident. The obfuscation score is 0, given the clear and straightforward code. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting its role as test code with no production secrets or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured testing suite with no malicious or security-compromising elements. It poses negligible security risk and contains no obfuscated or malicious code. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.",
