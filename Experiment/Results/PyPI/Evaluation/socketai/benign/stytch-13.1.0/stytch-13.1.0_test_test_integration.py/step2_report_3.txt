  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, obfuscation, data flows, and overall security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a comprehensive set of integration tests for various API endpoints, using constants and responses.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API calls with sensitive data (signatures, tokens, user IDs). Data flows are from test constants into API requests.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets beyond test constants, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard testing suite, with no malicious intent or behavior. The data flows are expected in testing environments, and no malicious patterns are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1 (negligible).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—testing a client SDK with test constants.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API interactions with dummy data; no untrusted data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, no obfuscation, straightforward test code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard testing code with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, testing various API endpoints with constants.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Use of test constants in API calls; no suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or secrets beyond test data.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clear, well-structured test code, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar testing suite with constants.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API calls with test data; no untrusted data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard testing code, safe, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Testing various API features with constants.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API calls with test data; no suspicious flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical testing suite, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently show 0. The code is purely for testing, with no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, as the code is test code with constants and API calls only.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a comprehensive test suite, with no malicious intent or behavior.\n- No suspicious data flows, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- The use of test constants and API responses is standard practice.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the presence of test constants and API interactions, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured testing suite with no security concerns or malicious behavior.",
