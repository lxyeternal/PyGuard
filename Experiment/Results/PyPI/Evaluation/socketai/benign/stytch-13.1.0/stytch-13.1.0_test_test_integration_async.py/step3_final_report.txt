{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive suite of asynchronous unit tests for various authentication and user management features of an SDK, utilizing predefined test constants and API responses to verify functionality.",
  "sources": "Test constants imported from 'test.constants' and API responses from SDK method calls.",
  "sinks": "API calls transmitting data; no external data writes or untrusted input handling beyond test constants.",
  "flows": "Test constants and API responses flow into network requests and response validations; no untrusted external data flows into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated segments detected. Tests include skips for unimplemented features, which are standard placeholders.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured as a set of async unit tests for SDK features, using controlled test data. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of test constants and standard API interactions indicates a benign testing environment. The skipped tests reflect incomplete coverage but do not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code demonstrates legitimate testing practices without signs of supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured test suite with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the controlled testing context. No adjustments are necessary.",
