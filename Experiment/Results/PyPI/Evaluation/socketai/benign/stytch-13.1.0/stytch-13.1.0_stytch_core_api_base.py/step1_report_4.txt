  "purpose": "A utility class for constructing URLs based on a base URL, routes, and data",
  "sources": "Input parameters: base_url, route, data, sub_url",
  "sinks": "None directly; URL construction functions return strings based on input",
  "flows": "Input data (base_url, route, data, sub_url) -> URL strings returned by methods",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious patterns, or malicious code observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods to generate URLs using provided base URL, route, and data. It utilizes urllib.parse for safe URL joining. The url_for method formats the URL with data, which could be unsafe if data is untrusted, but no direct injection or malicious activity is evident. The route_with_sub_url method joins paths safely. There are no indicators of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious data handling. Overall, the code performs URL construction in a straightforward manner without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple URL builder with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The implementation is standard and safe.",
