  "purpose": "Provide URL construction methods for API endpoints based on a base URL and routes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: base_url, route, data, sub_url.",
  "sinks": "urllib.parse.urljoin, str.format, returning constructed URLs.",
  "flows": "base_url + route/sub_url + data formatted into URL, with route and sub_url influencing URL composition.",
  "anomalies": "Use of str.format on URLs with untrusted data could potentially lead to URL manipulation or injection if data is maliciously crafted, but this is limited to URL formatting; no direct code injection or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for URL management, combining base URL with routes and sub-routes, formatting URLs with provided data. It does not handle user input directly, nor does it perform unsafe operations such as executing untrusted code. The use of str.format on URLs could theoretically be misused if data contains format specifiers, but in typical use, this is a safe pattern. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard URL helper without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward URL construction utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It operates safely within its scope, with minimal risk from URL formatting functions.",
