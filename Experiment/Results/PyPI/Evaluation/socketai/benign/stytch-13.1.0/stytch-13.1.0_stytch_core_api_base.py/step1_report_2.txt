  "purpose": "This code defines a base class for constructing URLs by combining a base URL with specific routes and sub-URLs.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'base_url', 'route', and 'data' in url_for; 'sub_url' and optional 'route' in route_with_sub_url.",
  "sinks": "The url_for method uses string formatting with data, which could be risky if data is untrusted; however, it's primarily for URL construction.",
  "flows": "Input data (base_url, route, data, sub_url) flows into URL construction methods, resulting in generated URLs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or malicious patterns detected. The URL formatting uses .format(**data), which could potentially be unsafe if data contains malicious format strings, but this is standard usage for URL construction.",
  "analysis": "The code provides URL construction utilities by joining base URLs with routes and sub-URLs. The url_for method formats URLs with user-provided data, which could theoretically be exploited if data contains malicious format strings. However, this pattern is common for URL building. No external data fetching, network connections, or suspicious behavior is present. The class is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple URL construction utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor consideration is ensuring 'data' used in URL formatting is validated if used with untrusted sources, but as is, it does not pose a significant threat.",
