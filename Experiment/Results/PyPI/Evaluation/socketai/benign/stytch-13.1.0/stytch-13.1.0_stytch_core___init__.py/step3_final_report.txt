  "purpose": "Assess supply chain security of an open source Python dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, anomalies, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, environment variable access, network connections, file operations, input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable usage, data outputs, system commands.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via data processing functions, network calls, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual data flows, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is absent; all reports correctly identify this and refrain from speculative claims. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate given no evidence. Confidence levels are low to moderate, reflecting uncertainty due to missing code. Risk scores are conservatively low (around 0.1-0.2), aligning with the lack of suspicious patterns. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected or implied. The reasoning across reports is consistent and cautious, avoiding false positives.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk scores are appropriate, and the reports are consistent with the data. Slight adjustments to confidence scores downward could better reflect the uncertainty. Overall, the supply chain appears secure given the available information.",
