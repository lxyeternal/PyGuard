  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and score appropriateness.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Content:** No code provided.\n- **Findings:** Cannot analyze code; no source, sink, flow, anomalies.\n- **Scores:** All zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; without code, no issues can be identified.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Content:** No code provided.\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; cannot analyze specifics.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Content:** Describes a generic utility script, no code.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no anomalies, low confidence.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.6, securityRisk 0.2, malware 0.\n- **Analysis:** The report emphasizes lack of code and suspicious activity, which is reasonable.\n- **Issue:** The risk score (0.2) might be slightly high given the lack of evidence, but considering the uncertainty, it could be justified as a conservative measure.\n\n**Recommendation:** The risk score of 0.2 is acceptable, but perhaps slightly conservative. No change necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Content:** Similar to previous, generic analysis.\n- **Findings:** No evidence of malicious activity, benign appearance.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.6, securityRisk 0.2, malware 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the lack of code and suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Content:** Minimal code, no suspicious features.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, benign structure.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.3, securityRisk 0.2, malware 0.\n- **Assessment:** The low confidence reflects uncertainty, which is appropriate given the minimal information.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Observations:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the absence of code and the inability to perform detailed analysis.\n- The scores assigned are generally conservative and consistent with the findings.\n- The malware scores are zero across all reports, which is appropriate given no malicious activity is evident.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, aligning with the lack of suspicious code structures.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Remain at 0 across all reports; no evidence suggests malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, consistent with the reports.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly subjective; most are low (0.2), which seems reasonable given the lack of code.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, due to lack of data)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate. No significant adjustments are necessary.",
