  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Obfuscation indicators, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec), complex syntax, absence of code snippets, standard data handling routines.",
  "sinks": "Potential dynamic code execution, data exfiltration routines, network connections, file modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Obfuscation or dynamic code execution points leading to potential malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation score (0.8) without code deobfuscation, reliance on suspicion, absence of concrete code snippets, inconsistent confidence levels.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 indicates suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic execution, with scores reflecting moderate concern; Report 2-5 show benign or insufficient evidence, with low malware and obfuscation scores. The scores are generally consistent with the descriptions, but without concrete code, suspicion remains speculative. The high obfuscation score in Report 1 justifies a higher security risk, but confirmation requires further analysis.",
  "conclusion": "Report 1 exhibits features that warrant cautious review, with suspicion of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, leading to moderate malware and risk scores. Other reports are consistent with benign code. Overall, the scores align with the provided descriptions, but further deobfuscation and runtime analysis are recommended for Report 1 to confirm malicious intent.",
