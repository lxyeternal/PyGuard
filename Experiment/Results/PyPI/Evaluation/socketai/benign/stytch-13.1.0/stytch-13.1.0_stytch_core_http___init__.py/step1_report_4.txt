  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some data processing and possibly interacts with external resources or inputs, but its exact purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Potential data input points include any function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules that handle external data or user input. However, no explicit input sources are visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file I/O operations, or data outputs such as print statements or API calls. The code does not show any explicit data sinks or external communications.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flow is observable in the code snippet. Without external input or output operations, data flow appears internal and benign.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code uses standard language features and libraries without unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review shows standard Python constructs with no signs of malicious behavior. The code does not contain obfuscated sections, suspicious network activity, or hidden backdoors. The purpose appears to be legitimate data processing, but without full context, some assumptions are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. The code seems benign, with no evident malicious behavior or security concerns. Confidence is high that this is a safe, normal code segment.",
