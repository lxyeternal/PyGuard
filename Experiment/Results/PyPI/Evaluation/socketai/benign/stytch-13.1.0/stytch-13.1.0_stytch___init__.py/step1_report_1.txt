  "purpose": "Define and expose specific classes and variables related to the Stytch SDK modules and version.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'stytch' library modules",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code only imports modules and defines __all__",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow, no untrusted input handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward module setup with no dynamic execution or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and version info from the 'stytch' package, then defines __all__ to specify exports. There are no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The imported modules appear to be legitimate components of the SDK. The overall structure is simple and standard for module initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import and export setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
