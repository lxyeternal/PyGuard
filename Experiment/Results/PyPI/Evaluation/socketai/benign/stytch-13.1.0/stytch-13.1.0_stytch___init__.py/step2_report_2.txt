  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the original code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\nThe code imports specific classes and a version variable from the 'stytch' SDK modules and defines `__all__` to specify what is exported when the module is imported elsewhere. It is a straightforward module setup, with no dynamic execution, data processing, or network activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  All reports describe the code as a simple import and export setup, which matches the original code. There are no discrepancies.\n\n### Logical flaws, errors, or mistakes:\n- **No errors or flaws detected.**  \n  The code is standard and correct for its purpose.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct since the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any suspicious or risky behavior.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code only performs static imports and defines `__all__`, there is no risk of malicious activity or security issues.\n- The code does not handle untrusted data, execute dynamic code, or include secrets.\n\n### Critical observations:\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  None. The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the code is part of a package's API setup, it’s unlikely to introduce security issues on its own.\n- The only concern would be if the imported modules themselves are malicious, but given they are from a known SDK ('stytch'), this is highly unlikely.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n**The current scores are appropriate.**  \nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
