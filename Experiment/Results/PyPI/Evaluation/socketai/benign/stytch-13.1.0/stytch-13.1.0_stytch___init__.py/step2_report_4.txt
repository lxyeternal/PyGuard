  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\nfrom stytch.b2b.client import Client as B2BClient\nfrom stytch.consumer.client import Client\nfrom stytch.version import __version__\n\n__all__ = [\"B2BClient\", \"Client\", \"__version__\"]\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard module setup with imports and `__all__`.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious patterns, legitimate SDK imports.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0, 0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0, 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious code.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0, 0\n- **Assessment:** Valid. The code is benign.\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Findings:** No issues, standard SDK import pattern.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0, 0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious activity.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0, 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Critical Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code only performs static imports and defines `__all__`. No dynamic execution, no user input handling, no network activity, no credential handling, and no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Scores are correctly zero across all reports. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risks:** None detected; the code appears to be a simple module setup.\n\n### **Potential Discrepancies & Justification:**\n- The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any suspicious activity.\n- Since the code only imports and exports symbols, it cannot be malicious or obfuscated unless the imported modules are compromised—nothing in the report suggests that.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard module setup, importing specific classes and version info from a well-known SDK, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
