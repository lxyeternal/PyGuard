  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes and variables from the 'stytch' SDK modules and defines the __all__ list for module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'stytch.b2b.client', 'stytch.consumer.client', and 'stytch.version' modules.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only imports modules and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module import and export declaration. It imports classes and version info from external SDK modules without executing any code that handles user input, network data, or sensitive information. There are no dynamic code executions, no credential handling, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard import and export setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
