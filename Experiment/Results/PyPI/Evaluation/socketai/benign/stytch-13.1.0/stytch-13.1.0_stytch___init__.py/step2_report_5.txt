  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward import statements from the 'stytch' SDK modules, setting the `__all__` variable.\n- No dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, no network operations, and no hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The code appears to be standard module setup code, likely part of a larger SDK or application.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1:\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies, straightforward imports, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Reasoning:** Correctly identified as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2:\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard imports, no suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Reasoning:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3:\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; simple import and export setup.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Reasoning:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4:\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; no suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Reasoning:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5:\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard module export code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Reasoning:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code's simplicity, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is not obfuscated; all reports agree on this. So, 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code only imports SDK components and defines `__all__`, with no suspicious behavior, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**However,** I will add a note:\n- If any report had claimed a non-zero risk score without evidence, I would challenge it. But all reports are consistent here.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this.",
