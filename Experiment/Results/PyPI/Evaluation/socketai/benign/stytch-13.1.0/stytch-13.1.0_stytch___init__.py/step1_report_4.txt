  "purpose": "Define module exports for stytch SDK components and version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the stytch library modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or user input processing present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and variables from the 'stytch' SDK modules and declares the __all__ list for module exports. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or include any suspicious logic. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or security risks are present. The imports are standard for SDK components, and the version variable is a typical attribute for package versioning.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module export setup for the stytch SDK components with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
