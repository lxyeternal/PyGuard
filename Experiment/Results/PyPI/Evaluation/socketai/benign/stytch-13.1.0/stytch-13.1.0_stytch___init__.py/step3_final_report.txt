  "purpose": "Import specific classes and version info from the 'stytch' SDK modules and define the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'stytch.b2b.client', 'stytch.consumer.client', and 'stytch.version'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, no network activity, no execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Static import of modules -> definition of __all__ for exports; no runtime data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export setup with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static imports of SDK components and defines __all__ to specify exports. It contains no dynamic execution, no handling of untrusted input, no network operations, and no obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code. There are no anomalies or signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the reports' assessments.",
