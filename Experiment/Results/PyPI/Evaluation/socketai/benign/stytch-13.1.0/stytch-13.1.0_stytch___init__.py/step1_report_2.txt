{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes and variables from the stytch library modules and defines the public API of the module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external library 'stytch', specifically from 'stytch.b2b.client', 'stytch.consumer.client', and 'stytch.version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; no code execution or data transmission is present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports modules and defines __all__, with no data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward import statements from a well-known SDK ('stytch') and sets the __all__ variable to define the module's public interface. It does not include any dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or network operations. The presence of imports from a third-party library is common and not inherently suspicious. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears to be standard module setup code, likely part of a larger package or application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to import specific classes and variables and define the module's exports. There are no indicators of malware, malicious intent, or security risks in this snippet.",
