  "purpose": "Define and expose certain classes and variables related to the 'stytch' SDK for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements fetching classes and variables from the 'stytch' package modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no user input or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Importing classes and variables; no data flow from external or untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets detected. The code is straightforward and typical for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and version info from the 'stytch' package modules, then defines __all__ to specify public exports. No dynamic code execution, no credential handling, no suspicious behaviors, and no external data processing observed. The imports are from known package modules, and the code's structure is standard for Python package APIs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign module that exposes certain classes and variables for external use. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks present in this snippet.",
