{
  "purpose": "Retrieve and display the last commit author, timestamp, and ID for a specified file in the local Git repository.",
  "sources": "Command line argument for filename, repository's commit history via Dulwich library",
  "sinks": "Output to console (print statements)",
  "flows": "Input filename -> Encode filename -> Walk commit history -> Retrieve last commit -> Print author, time, and ID",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward read-only operation, no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code reads a filename argument, encodes it, and uses Dulwich's Repo to find the last commit affecting that file. It handles the case where the file is not found and outputs the author, commit time, and commit ID. The script performs only read operations on the local repository, with no network activity, data leaks, or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The code is simple, correct, and safe, with minimal security exposure limited to repository data visibility.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for inspecting Git history. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are justified and appropriate.",
