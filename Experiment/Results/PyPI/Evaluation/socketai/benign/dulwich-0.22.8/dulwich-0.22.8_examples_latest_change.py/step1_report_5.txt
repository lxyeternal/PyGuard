{
  "purpose": "Retrieve and display the last author and change time of a specified file from a Git repository using Dulwich.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line argument for filename, interacts with the local Git repository to fetch commit history.",
  "sinks": "Outputs information to the console via print statements.",
  "flows": "Input filename → Repository walk to find last change → Output author and timestamp to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code or suspicious imports. Uses standard library and Dulwich for version control interactions.",
  "analysis": "The script takes a filename as input, encodes it, and uses Dulwich's Repo to walk through commit history for that file. It retrieves the latest commit that affected the file and prints the author and timestamp. There are no external network calls, no data leaks, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard utility script for inspecting Git history. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are present. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and focused on its intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for inspecting Git history to find the last author of a specified file. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It operates solely on local repository data and outputs to the console.",
