  "anomalies": [
    "Importing 'dulwich' at runtime without any validation or sandboxing, but this is typical for a documentation build and not inherently malicious.",
    "No hardcoded credentials, environment variable manipulations, or suspicious code patterns.",
    "No dynamic execution or obfuscated code present.",
    "The code is a standard configuration script with no suspicious functions or commands."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file. It imports necessary modules, sets up project-specific parameters, and loads the 'dulwich' package to retrieve version info. All imported modules and package references are used for configuration purposes only. There are no network connections, data exfiltration, or code execution that could be malicious. The import of 'dulwich' is for version info and is common in such scripts. No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected. The code structure and content are consistent with normal documentation build setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Sphinx configuration file used for project documentation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs only legitimate setup tasks related to documentation generation.",
