  "flows": [
    "Code imports the 'dulwich' module via dynamic import, then accesses 'dulwich.__version__' to determine version info."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Dynamic import of 'dulwich' and use of 'dulwich.__version__' in configuration, but no apparent malicious behavior.",
    "No user input handling, network activity, or data leakage present.",
    "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file that imports 'os', 'sys', and dynamically imports the 'dulwich' module to extract version information for documentation purposes. It does not execute any untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. The only notable action is the import of 'dulwich', which is a normal dependency for this documentation build, and the use of its version info. There are no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. Overall, the script functions solely as a configuration for documentation generation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with safe practices. It performs no malicious actions or suspicious behavior. It relies on standard libraries and a single dependency import for version info. No security risks are detected.",
