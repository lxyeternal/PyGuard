  "purpose": "Helper functions for parsing YAML strings, specifically CloudFormation templates with intrinsic functions.",
  "sources": "Input is the YAML string passed to yaml_parse function; internal YAML nodes during parsing.",
  "sinks": "Potential injection points are the yaml.safe_load call and the custom constructor registration, but they do not execute untrusted code directly.",
  "flows": "yaml_parse calls yaml.safe_load, which processes the YAML string, invoking the custom constructor 'intrinsics_multi_constructor' for specific tags.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code defines a parsing utility without executing untrusted code or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a YAML parsing utility that registers a custom constructor for CloudFormation intrinsic functions. The custom constructor handles specific tags and transforms YAML nodes into Python data structures. No unsafe code execution, network operations, or malicious behaviors are evident. Usage of yaml.safe_load is appropriate for secure parsing, and the custom constructor simply maps YAML tags to Python dicts and lists, which is a standard pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard YAML parsing helper with a custom constructor for CloudFormation. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior and appears safe for its intended purpose.",
