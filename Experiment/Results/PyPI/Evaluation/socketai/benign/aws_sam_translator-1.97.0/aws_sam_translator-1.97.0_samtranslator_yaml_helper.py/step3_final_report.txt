  "purpose": "Extension of YAML parser to handle CloudFormation intrinsic functions via custom tags, enabling structured parsing of CloudFormation templates.",
  "sources": "YAML input strings containing CloudFormation intrinsic tags (e.g., !Ref, !GetAtt, !Condition).",
  "sinks": "Conversion of tagged nodes into Python data structures; no direct data leaks or external system interactions occur.",
  "flows": "Input YAML with intrinsic tags -> custom multi-constructor interprets tags -> constructs corresponding Python dictionaries and lists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code straightforwardly registers custom constructors and uses safe_load, with no code execution or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code extends yaml.SafeLoader with a multi-constructor to parse CloudFormation intrinsic tags, converting them into dictionaries. It uses yaml.safe_load, which prevents code execution. The constructor handles scalar, sequence, and mapping nodes appropriately. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or malicious patterns are present. The implementation is standard and secure, with minimal risk associated with custom tag handling. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior, reflecting a safe utility for structured YAML parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard extension for parsing CloudFormation YAML templates. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
