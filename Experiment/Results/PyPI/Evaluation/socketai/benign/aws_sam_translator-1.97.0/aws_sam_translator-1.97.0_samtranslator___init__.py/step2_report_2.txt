  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no input sources, data processing, external calls, or suspicious patterns.  \n   **Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that this is boilerplate version information without any malicious intent or security concern.  \n   **No errors or flaws** are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, correctly reflecting the benign nature.  \n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.  \n   \n   The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, the risk scores should remain at 0.  \n   **No justification exists for higher scores** in this context.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as standard version declaration.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall assessment:** The code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
