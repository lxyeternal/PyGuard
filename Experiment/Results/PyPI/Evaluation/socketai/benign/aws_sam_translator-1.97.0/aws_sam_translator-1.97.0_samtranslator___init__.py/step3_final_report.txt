  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable for package metadata.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment of a string value.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; simple static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string to __version__, with no input, output, or dynamic behavior. It does not invoke external resources, perform data processing, or contain obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores reflecting no malicious or security concerns. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), and the code shows no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
