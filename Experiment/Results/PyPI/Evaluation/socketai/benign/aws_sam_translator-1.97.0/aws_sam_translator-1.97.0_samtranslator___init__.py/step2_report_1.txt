  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable. This is consistent with the original code snippet, which is just:\n```python\n__version__ = \"1.97.0\"\n```\nThere are no additional code segments, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues or anomalies are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent in their description, emphasizing that the code is boilerplate, benign, and standard.  \n- They correctly identify the absence of data flows, external calls, or suspicious patterns.  \n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- All reports assign `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, and `securityRisk=0`, which aligns with the code's simplicity.  \n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.  \n- The reasoning appears sound, and no adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n- The risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate.  \n- Since the code is just a version string assignment, there's no basis for higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct.  \n- The code does not perform any malicious activity, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as standard metadata.  \n- No unwarranted claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n- Given the simplicity and benign nature, the scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard version declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern.**  \n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese align with the reports and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- No changes or corrections are necessary.\n- The code is benign, with no security risks.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scoring and conclude that this code snippet poses no security threat.",
