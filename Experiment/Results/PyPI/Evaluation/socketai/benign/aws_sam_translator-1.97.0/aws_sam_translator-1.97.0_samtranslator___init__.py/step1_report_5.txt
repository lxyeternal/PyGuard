  "anomalies": "Presence of only a version string assignment; no suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the variable '__version__'. This is a common practice in Python packages to specify version info. There are no other code components, input reading, or data processing. No suspicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and typical for package versioning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to specify the package version. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
