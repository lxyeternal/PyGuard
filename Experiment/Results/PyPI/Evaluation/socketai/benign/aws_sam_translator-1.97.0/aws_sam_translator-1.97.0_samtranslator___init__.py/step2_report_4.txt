  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the reported code in the original snippet:**\n   - The original code is simply:\n     ```python\n     __version__ = \"1.97.0\"\n     ```\n   - All reports correctly identify this as a straightforward version string assignment with no additional logic.\n\n2. **Assessment of each report:**\n   - Each report confirms that the code is a benign, standard practice for version declaration.\n   - No input sources, data flows, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - Obfuscation, malware, and security risk scores are all 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n3. **Evaluation of scores:**\n   - The scores seem consistent and reasonable.\n   - Since the code is just a static assignment, there's no reason to increase the malware or security risk scores.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation present.\n\n4. **Potential issues or assumptions:**\n   - No claims of malicious behavior are made; all assessments agree on benignity.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a simple, standard version declaration with no malicious intent.\n- The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified given the clarity and simplicity.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that appropriately. No adjustments are necessary.",
