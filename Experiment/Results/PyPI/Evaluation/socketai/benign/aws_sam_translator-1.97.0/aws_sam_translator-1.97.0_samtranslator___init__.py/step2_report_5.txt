  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of the code in question:**\n   - All reports describe a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - The original code provided matches this description exactly.\n   - No additional code, logic, or external interactions are present.\n\n2. **Evaluation of each report:**\n   - Each report correctly identifies that the code is a simple version declaration.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are detected.\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis and appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n   - Since the code is just a static assignment, there is no reason to assign any risk or malware scores above 0.\n   - The reasoning in all reports is sound and based on the code's actual content.\n\n5. **Challenging assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions about hidden behavior or obfuscation are warranted here.\n   - The code is boilerplate version info, a common and safe pattern.\n\n6. **Overall assessment:**\n   - The reports are accurate and consistent.\n   - The scores reflect the true nature of the code.\n   - No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk associated with a version string assignment)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, standard version declaration, with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
