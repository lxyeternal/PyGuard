  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'aws-sam-translator' library, reading metadata, version, and dependencies from local files.",
  "sources": "Reads local files: __init__.py for version, README.md for description, requirements files for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; static file reads only.",
  "flows": "Reads static files to gather package metadata; no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks: reading static files, extracting version info with regex, and configuring package metadata. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The structure is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, typical package setup process.",
