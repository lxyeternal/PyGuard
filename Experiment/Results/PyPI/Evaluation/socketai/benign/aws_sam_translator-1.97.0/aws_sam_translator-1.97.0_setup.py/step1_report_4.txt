{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package called 'aws-sam-translator', used to build and install the package from source.",
  "sources": "Reading files such as '__init__.py', 'README.md', and requirements files ('base.txt', 'dev.txt') from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No untrusted data is written to external systems or used in dangerous ways.",
  "flows": "File reading functions load package metadata and requirements. Data flows from filesystem into variables used in setup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual patterns. Functions perform straightforward file reads and regex parsing without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python package: reading version info, requirements, and metadata. It uses safe functions and common practices without dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or data leaks. All operations involve local filesystem reads and data processing for package installation, with no indicators of malicious behavior or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign, standard setup configuration file for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It simply prepares the package for distribution using conventional methods.",
