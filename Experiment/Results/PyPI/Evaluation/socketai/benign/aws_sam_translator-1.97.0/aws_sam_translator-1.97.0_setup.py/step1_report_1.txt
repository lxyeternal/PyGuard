  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package called 'aws-sam-translator', used to package and distribute the AWS SAM Translator library.",
  "sources": "Reads files such as '__init__.py', 'README.md', and requirement files in the 'requirements' directory; uses environment variables indirectly via 'os.path' and 'os.linesep'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data outputs, network connections, or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "File reading functions pass data into variables, then into setup parameters; no external or untrusted data flows into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; the code performs standard package setup tasks without dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging, involving reading metadata and requirements from files, then configuring package installation parameters. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The functions are straightforward, performing file I/O and regex parsing to obtain version info. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It reads package metadata and dependencies securely without any suspicious behavior.",
