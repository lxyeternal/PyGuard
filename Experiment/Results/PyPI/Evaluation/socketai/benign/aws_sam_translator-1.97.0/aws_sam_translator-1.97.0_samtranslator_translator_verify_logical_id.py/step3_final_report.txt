  "purpose": "Validate the uniqueness of a resource's logical ID within existing resources, with exceptions for specific resource types based on a static mapping.",
  "sources": "The resource.logical_id attribute, existing_resources dictionary, and the do_not_verify mapping.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the function performs in-memory checks only.",
  "flows": "The function checks if resource.logical_id exists in existing_resources; if so, it verifies resource type against do_not_verify mapping to determine validity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward. The only potential concern is reliance on external data structures, but within this scope, no security issues are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple validation utility that ensures resource logical IDs are unique, with special handling for certain resource types via a static mapping. It performs in-memory lookups and conditional checks without external calls or data leaks. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is correct and clear. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting its benign nature. Slightly conservative scores of 0.1 for security risk in some reports are acceptable but could be lowered to 0. Given the straightforward and safe purpose, the overall assessment confirms the code is secure and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward resource validation function with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No improvements or changes are necessary.",
