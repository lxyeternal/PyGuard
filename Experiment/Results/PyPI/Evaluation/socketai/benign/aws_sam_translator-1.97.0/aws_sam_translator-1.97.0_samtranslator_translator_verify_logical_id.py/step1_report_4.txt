{
  "purpose": "The code appears to validate the uniqueness of resource logical IDs within a CloudFormation/SAM template, with specific handling for certain resource types.",
  "sources": "The code reads resource attributes such as resource.logical_id and existing_resources dictionary entries.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a boolean value indicating uniqueness; no data leaks or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data from resource and existing_resources flows into the conditional logic to determine if the ID is unique or should be exempted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present. The do_not_verify list is hardcoded but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, checking resource IDs for uniqueness while excluding certain resource types from verification. No external network calls, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The data flows are internal checks, and no data is leaked or misused.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard validation task without any malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and appears safe.",
