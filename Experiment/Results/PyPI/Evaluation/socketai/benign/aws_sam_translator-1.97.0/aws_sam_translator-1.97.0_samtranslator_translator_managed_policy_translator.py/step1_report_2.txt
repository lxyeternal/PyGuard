  "purpose": "Load AWS IAM managed policies and cache their names and ARNs",
  "sources": "IAM client get_paginator and paginate methods for listing policies",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data sinks are present",
  "flows": "Method call to list policies -> retrieval of policy names and ARNs -> storage in _policy_map",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to perform a standard AWS IAM policy listing operation without suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code uses the IAM client's paginator to list policies scoped to AWS, storing policy names and ARNs in a dictionary. It involves logging and caching. No hardcoded secrets, no network connections beyond the AWS SDK, and no data manipulation that could indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward, primarily for resource listing, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard IAM policy loader with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It performs a controlled listing of AWS managed policies and caches the results for reuse. No malware or security risks are evident.",
