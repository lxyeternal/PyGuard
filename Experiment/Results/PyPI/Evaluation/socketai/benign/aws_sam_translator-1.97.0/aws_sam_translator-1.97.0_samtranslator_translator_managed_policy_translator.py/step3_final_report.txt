{
  "purpose": "Loads AWS IAM policies scoped to AWS using boto3 paginator, caches policy names and ARNs for efficient retrieval.",
  "sources": "API call to 'list_policies' via paginator with Scope='AWS' and PaginationConfig.",
  "sinks": "Internal cache (_policy_map); no external data sinks or leaks.",
  "flows": "Paginator retrieves policies -> updates internal dictionary -> load() returns cached data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard AWS resource listing operation, with proper use of boto3 paginator, logging, and type annotations. It does not handle secrets or perform network operations beyond AWS SDK. The fixed max_items parameter is documented and not inherently risky. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for listing and caching AWS IAM policies. It poses minimal security risk and contains no malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
