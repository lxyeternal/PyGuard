  "purpose": "Utility for checking AWS region support and service availability using boto3 and ArnGenerator.",
  "sources": "boto3.Session(), ArnGenerator.get_partition_name(), ArnGenerator.BOTO_SESSION_REGION_NAME",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; reads environment and AWS configuration data",
  "flows": "Session initialization -> get_region_name -> get_partition_name -> get_available_regions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard SDK usage; no obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that queries AWS SDK for region and service support, using standard practices. It handles missing region info gracefully and relies on external ArnGenerator for partition info. No data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The use of boto3.Session() can access environment credentials, but this is typical SDK behavior and not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign AWS support utility with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) reflecting standard SDK interactions. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
