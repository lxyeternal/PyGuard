{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to generate deterministic, stable logical IDs for resources, primarily used in cloud infrastructure management, based on a prefix and optional data object or pre-computed hash.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'prefix', 'data_obj', and 'data_hash' parameters during class initialization.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit data to external sources or untrusted destinations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters ('data_obj' or 'data_hash') through stringification and hashing functions to generate a stable ID string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are detected; the code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for generating resource IDs based on input data and a prefix, ensuring stability by hashing the data. It uses standard Python modules (hashlib and json). The methods perform data serialization and hashing, with options for pre-computed hashes. No external network calls, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for generating deterministic resource IDs, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks.",
