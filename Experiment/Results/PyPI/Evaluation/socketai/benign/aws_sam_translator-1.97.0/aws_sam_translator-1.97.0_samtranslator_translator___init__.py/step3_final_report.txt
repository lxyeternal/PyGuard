  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code segments where input data is read, dynamic execution functions (eval, exec), network addresses, environment variables, or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, system modifications, network communications, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Sources leading to sinks via function calls, data assignments, or dynamic code execution pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscated variable names, suspicious network addresses, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code patterns without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign across most reports, with no explicit malicious patterns. Suspicion in Report 2 stems from potential obfuscation and dynamic execution, but no concrete malicious payloads are confirmed. Reports 1, 3, 4, and 5 show no suspicious activity, with scores reflecting low threat levels. The scores are consistent with the evidence, with slight caution in Report 2 due to suspicion of obfuscation and dynamic code use. Overall, the assessments are justified, and no significant adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe with low malware and security risks. Suspicion in Report 2 warrants a slightly higher obfuscation score but remains within reasonable bounds. No confirmed malicious activity is present, and the supply chain appears secure based on the provided analysis.",
