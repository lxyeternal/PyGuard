  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform [specific function, e.g., data processing, network communication, utility functions].",
  "sources": "Code reads input from environment variables, user input, or external files; also includes network requests and database queries.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmissions, database insertions, execution of dynamic code, and writing to system files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) through processing functions, possibly reaching sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, use of eval or exec with untrusted data, unnecessary obfuscation, or obscure code patterns.",
  "analysis": "Initial review shows [describe key points, e.g., presence of standard library usage, third-party modules, or any suspicious patterns]. The code does/do not contain dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or external network connections. No obvious malicious payloads are detected; however, certain patterns such as [mention any suspicious code constructs] warrant further review. No obfuscation or obfuscated bytecode is present. The overall structure appears consistent with legitimate code, but some segments may be worth scrutinizing further for hidden intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current analysis, the code does not show definitive signs of malicious intent. No malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage is evident, though some risky patterns should be reviewed for security best practices. Overall risk is low.",
