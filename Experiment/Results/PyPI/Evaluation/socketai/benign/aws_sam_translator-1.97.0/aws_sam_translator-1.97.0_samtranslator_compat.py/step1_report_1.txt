{
  "purpose": "To conditionally import the pydantic library, handling different versions and compatibility issues.",
  "sources": "Import statements and exception handling blocks that read the pydantic library and its attributes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data; only import mechanisms and attribute checks.",
  "flows": "Attempted import of pydantic, followed by fallback import, with attribute check to determine version.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try/except blocks to manage version-specific imports is standard, but no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to import pydantic correctly across different versions, including fallbacks and compatibility fixes. It checks for specific attributes to determine the version. No data leaks, injections, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard version compatibility handling for a dependency, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version compatibility pattern for importing the pydantic library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and follows standard practices for library import management.",
