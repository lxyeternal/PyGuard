{
  "purpose": "To import the pydantic library with fallback handling for different versions or import issues.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'pydantic' library import statements and checks for ImportError and AttributeError during import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The code attempts to import pydantic, with fallback logic to handle different versions or import errors. No data flows are present beyond the import logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses version-specific import handling with try/except blocks, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily focused on importing the pydantic library correctly across different versions. The try/except structure is used to handle import failures and compatibility issues. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or other risky operations. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The handling appears to be legitimate version compatibility management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign attempt to ensure compatibility when importing pydantic across different versions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
