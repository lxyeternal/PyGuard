  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard pattern for handling version compatibility in library imports.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is identified.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute any code that could be exploited.\n- The use of try/except blocks for import fallback is common practice and not indicative of obfuscation or malware.\n- The reference to `pydantic.error_wrappers.ValidationError` is a static attribute check, not dynamic code execution.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. There is no indication of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk score is very low (mostly 0 or 0.1). Given the benign nature of the code, this seems reasonable. The slight risk score (0.1) in some reports might be a conservative default, but it does not imply actual risk.\n\n**Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n\n- No issues are present in the code that would warrant raising the malware or risk scores.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nBased on the code and reports, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to version handling complexity, not actual risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, standard pattern for handling library version compatibility. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the low risk score reflects its harmless nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Score | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0            | No malicious activity or code present.                       |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.           |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1          | Minimal risk due to version handling, but no actual threat. |\n\nPlease let me know if further detailed analysis is needed.",
