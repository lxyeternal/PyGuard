{
  "purpose": "The code aims to import the 'pydantic' library with compatibility handling for different versions, ensuring the correct import or fallback in various environments.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'pydantic' package during import statements.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; the code does not handle external input or output data streams.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains version handling logic that might be used to obscure or complicate understanding, but it appears straightforward and intended for compatibility. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses try-except blocks to import the 'pydantic' library, handling different versions or import errors. The initial attempt uses an alias for a specific version, with fallbacks for ImportError and AttributeError. This pattern is typical for maintaining compatibility across library versions and does not involve malicious behavior. The code is simple, with no suspicious functions or network activity. It does not process untrusted input, nor does it perform any actions that could be malicious. No anomalies or obfuscation are present, just version management logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, focusing solely on compatibility handling for the 'pydantic' library. No malicious or security-risk behavior is detected.",
