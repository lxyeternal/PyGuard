  "purpose": "Handle compatibility for importing the pydantic library across different versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements with try/except blocks, attribute access to pydantic.error_wrappers.ValidationError.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Import attempt -> fallback import -> attribute access for validation.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard version handling pattern, no suspicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility wrapper for importing pydantic, using try/except blocks to manage different versions. It accesses a static attribute to verify import success. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious code are present. The pattern is common and benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a standard purpose of ensuring compatibility across pydantic versions. No malicious or security risks are detected.",
