{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import the pydantic library with compatibility handling for different versions, ensuring that 'pydantic' is imported correctly regardless of version differences.",
  "sources": "The code reads the pydantic module during import, including attribute access (pydantic.error_wrappers.ValidationError).",
  "sinks": "Accessing 'pydantic.error_wrappers.ValidationError' could potentially be a sink if it were dynamically evaluated or manipulated, but in this context, it appears to be a static reference.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import pydantic, then access a specific attribute to ensure the import succeeds; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a try/except pattern to handle version differences, which is normal; no suspicious or obfuscated code detected. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles version compatibility for the pydantic library, importing it in different scenarios based on ImportError or AttributeError. It references an attribute to verify the correct version import. There are no dynamic code executions, no network operations, or other suspicious behaviors. The code is clean, standard, and solely focused on ensuring proper import handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility wrapper for importing pydantic across different versions. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be a harmless utility for managing library imports.",
