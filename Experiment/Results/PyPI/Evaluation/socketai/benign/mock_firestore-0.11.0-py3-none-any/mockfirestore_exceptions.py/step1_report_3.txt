{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling client errors with specific HTTP status codes.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points that could lead to data leaks or security issues are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The class design appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. Each exception class has a 'code' attribute representing HTTP status codes, and the base class formats an error message combining 'code' and 'message'. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or security-sensitive operations involved. The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exceptions for an API or web service context, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply implements custom exception classes for handling client errors in a web application context. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious patterns, or security vulnerabilities present.",
