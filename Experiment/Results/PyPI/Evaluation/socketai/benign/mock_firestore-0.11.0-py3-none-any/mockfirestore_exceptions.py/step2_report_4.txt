  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not process external data, perform network operations, or include any suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security risks. No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0. These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports indicate no malicious activity or security risks, and the code is purely class definitions, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's structure and behavior, which is benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   The scores are consistent and justified based on the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional notes:\n\nGiven the simplicity and clarity of the code, and the unanimity of the reports, I concur with the current scores. There is no indication of hidden malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the thorough analysis and the nature of the code.",
