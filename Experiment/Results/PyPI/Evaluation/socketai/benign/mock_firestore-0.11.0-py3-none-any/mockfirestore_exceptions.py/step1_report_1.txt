  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling client errors with specific HTTP status codes.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading occurs within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, especially untrusted data or sensitive information, are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with specific error codes for different error types. The classes are well-structured and do not include any suspicious or malicious code. There is no data processing, input/output operations, or network activity. No obfuscation, hidden code, or dynamic code execution present. Overall, the code appears to be simple, standard class definitions intended for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
