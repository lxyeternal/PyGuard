  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sink points where data could cause leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. Each class assigns a 'code' attribute for HTTP-like error codes. The __init__ method initializes the message, and __str__ outputs a formatted string. The classes are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent. The structure aligns with typical error class definitions, and no obfuscated or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom error classes for handling client errors. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
