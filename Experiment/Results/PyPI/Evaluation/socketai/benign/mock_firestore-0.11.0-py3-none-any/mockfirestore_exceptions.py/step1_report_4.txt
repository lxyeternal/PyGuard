{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling with specific HTTP status codes.",
  "sources": "No input or external data is read; the code defines classes only.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink as there are no data inputs or external outputs.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The class structure and inheritance are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code creates custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. Each class assigns a 'code' attribute corresponding to HTTP status codes. The __init__ method sets a message, and __str__ provides a formatted string including the code and message. The class hierarchy is standard and intended for structured error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, data leakage, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a typical error class setup used in web applications or APIs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation of custom exception classes for error handling. No malicious activity or security issues are present.",
