  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with associated HTTP status codes for error handling.",
  "sources": "Class attribute 'code' and message parameter in __init__ method.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method outputs formatted string including 'code' and 'message'.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes leads to __str__ output; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no dynamic code or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with class attributes for HTTP status codes and a message attribute. The __init__ method initializes the message, and __str__ formats the output. There are no external inputs, network operations, or obfuscation. The code is static, simple, and standard for error handling purposes. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's nature and are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The assigned scores are justified and accurate.",
