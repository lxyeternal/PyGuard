  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error cases in an application.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "targets": "No data sinks or output operations involving untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's Exception class. It sets class-level 'code' attributes and overrides __str__ for message formatting. No external data input, no network activity, and no manipulation of environment variables or sensitive data are present. The structure and content are straightforward and typical for error handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks identified.",
