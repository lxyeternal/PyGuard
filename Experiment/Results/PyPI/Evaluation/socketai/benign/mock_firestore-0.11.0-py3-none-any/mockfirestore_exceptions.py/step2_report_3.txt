  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:  \n   The original code matches the descriptions across all reports. It defines custom exception classes with assigned HTTP status codes, initializing messages and overriding __str__ for formatted output. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:  \n   - The code is correct and free of errors or flaws.  \n   - The inheritance hierarchy is appropriate, and the use of class attributes and __str__ method is standard.\n\n3. **Scores Review**:  \n   - All reports assign `malware = 0`, `obfuscated = 0`, and `securityRisk = 0`, which aligns with the code's nature.  \n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which seems reasonable given the straightforwardness of the code.  \n   - The risk scores are all 0, indicating no security risk, which is consistent.\n\n4. **Justification of Risk Scores**:  \n   - Since the code is purely class definitions with no external input, no data processing, and no network activity, a risk score of 0 is justified.  \n   - No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n5. **Malware and Obfuscated Scores**:  \n   - Both are correctly set to 0, reflecting no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n6. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:  \n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and does not contain assumptions leading to vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Evaluation**:  \n- The code is a standard, secure implementation of custom exception classes.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Final conclusion**:  \nAll reports are accurate; the code is benign with no security risks. The scores are reasonable and justified based on the code's simplicity and purpose.",
