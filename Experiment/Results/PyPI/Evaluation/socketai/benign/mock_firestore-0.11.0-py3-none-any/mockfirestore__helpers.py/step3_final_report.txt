  "purpose": "Utility functions for nested dictionary access, timestamp handling, random string generation, and document iteration.",
  "sources": "Input data read from nested dictionaries and the current system time.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions do not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries through get/set/delete functions; timestamp generated from system clock; random strings generated locally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions with no network activity, no external data leaks, and no obfuscation. Random string generation uses non-cryptographic randomness, which is typical for non-security-critical purposes. The timestamp class only uses local system time. All functions perform expected operations without side effects or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify its safe nature. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
