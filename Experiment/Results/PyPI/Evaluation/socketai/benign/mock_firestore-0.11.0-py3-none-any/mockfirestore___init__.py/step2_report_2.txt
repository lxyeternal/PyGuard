  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; it performs a try-except import pattern for exceptions and imports classes from mockfirestore modules.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The logic is standard and straightforward.\n- **Scores:** The report assigns malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores all at 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity, no data leaks, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; the code is a typical compatibility pattern.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None observed.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0. This aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; standard import with fallback.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern, no anomalies.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent with benign code.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Matches the code pattern; no anomalies.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent with benign code.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\nBased on the provided code and reports, I concur with the assessments. The code is a standard pattern for optional dependency handling, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, benign, and standard for dependency management. No further action or concern is necessary.",
