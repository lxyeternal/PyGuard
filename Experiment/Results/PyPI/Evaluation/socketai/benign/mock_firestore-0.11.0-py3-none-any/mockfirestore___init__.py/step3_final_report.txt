  "sources": "Attempted import from google.api_core.exceptions; fallback import from mockfirestore.exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code performs static imports only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard try-except import pattern to handle optional dependencies for Google Cloud exceptions, falling back to local mock exceptions if necessary. It then imports various classes from mockfirestore modules for mocking Firestore behavior. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The import pattern is common and safe, with no external data handling or network activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility pattern for optional dependencies in Python, with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are appropriate.",
