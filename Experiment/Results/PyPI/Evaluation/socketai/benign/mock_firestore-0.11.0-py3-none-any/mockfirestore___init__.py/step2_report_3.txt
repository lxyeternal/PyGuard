  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the correctness of reasoning, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code performs straightforward conditional imports. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious activity are present.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Correctly identifies the pattern of fallback imports for optional dependencies. No suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Security risk: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Confidence: 1 — justified given the straightforward nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, standard conditional import pattern.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Correctly notes the fallback mechanism and absence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Security risk: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Confidence: 1 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern, no anomalies or malicious activity.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Correctly interprets the fallback import and benign nature.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Security risk: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Confidence: 0.9 — reasonable given the clarity.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as previous, standard import handling.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Properly identifies the fallback pattern and benign intent.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Security risk: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Confidence: 0.9 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern, no malicious activity.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Correctly interprets the fallback import and benign nature.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Security risk: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Confidence: 1 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, with scores at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; scores are 0.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\nGiven the uniformity and correctness of all reports, and the code's straightforward purpose of conditional imports for compatibility, **my estimated scores are**:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**The code appears entirely benign, with no security concerns.**",
