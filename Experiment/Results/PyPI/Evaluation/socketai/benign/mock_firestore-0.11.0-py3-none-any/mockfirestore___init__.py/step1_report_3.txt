{
  "purpose": "To set up imports for a mock Firestore client, handling both real and fallback exceptions.",
  "sources": "Import statements and try-except block for exception handling",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external effects are present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code performs import and conditional definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard import operations and fallback definitions",
  "analysis": "The code begins with comments referencing a similar pattern from another project. It attempts to import specific exceptions from the google.api_core.exceptions module. If that module is unavailable, it falls back to importing the same exception names from mockfirestore.exceptions, ensuring compatibility. The subsequent lines import various classes and functions from the mockfirestore package. The code structure is typical for conditional imports to handle optional dependencies, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. No suspicious data handling or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import setup with fallback handling for missing dependencies. It appears benign, serving to facilitate mock Firestore operations without introducing any malicious behavior or security risks.",
