{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations and paginator classes for the 'oam' service in boto3, primarily for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; no external or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing; methods accept kwargs and return PageIterator objects without external interactions.",
  "flows": "The paginate methods accept **kwargs and produce PageIterator outputs; no untrusted data flows or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected; standard SDK wrapper code.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, providing type annotations and class definitions for boto3 paginators. It uses conditional imports for Python version compatibility and defines classes with paginate methods that accept kwargs. There are no external data sources, network calls, or malicious constructs. The structure aligns with standard SDK patterns, serving as static type hints and documentation aids.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and intended solely for static type checking and documentation support. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
