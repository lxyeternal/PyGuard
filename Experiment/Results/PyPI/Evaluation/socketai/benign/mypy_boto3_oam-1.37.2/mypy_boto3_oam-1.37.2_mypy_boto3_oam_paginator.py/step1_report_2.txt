{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and paginator classes for the oam service client in boto3, facilitating pagination handling with type safety.",
  "sources": "Code reads type definitions from 'type_defs', imports system and typing modules, and reads class method parameters via **kwargs.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or malicious actions. No network, file, or environment variable manipulations observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (kwargs) flows into paginate methods, which then return PageIterator objects; no untrusted data processing or external interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be standard, well-structured type annotation definitions for boto3 paginators.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class definitions for boto3 paginator wrappers with proper type annotations, imports, and conditional imports based on Python version. No external data processing, network activities, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code is purely for type safety and documentation purposes, following standard practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. The code's intent aligns with its purpose to facilitate type-checked pagination in boto3 clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module providing type annotations and class definitions for boto3 paginator wrappers. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious patterns, or security risks identified. It is a typical type definition module with no security concerns.",
