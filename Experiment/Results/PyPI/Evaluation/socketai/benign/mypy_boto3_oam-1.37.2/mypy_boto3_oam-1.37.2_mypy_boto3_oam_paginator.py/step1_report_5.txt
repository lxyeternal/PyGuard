{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the oam service client in boto3, aimed at improving static type checking and code completion.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, and botocore.paginate; type definitions from .type_defs; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data leaks are present; functions only define paginator classes and methods with type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; methods accept kwargs for pagination parameters, but do not process or transmit untrusted data internally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; code is standard for boto3 paginator type definitions with conditional imports and type checking.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes with type annotations for the oam service, following standard patterns. Conditional imports and type hints are used to support different Python versions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The code strictly provides static type info and class inheritance for boto3 paginators. No external data processing or network activity occurs within this module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for type annotations and class structure for boto3 paginators, with no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or malware. It appears to be a legitimate, safe component to aid static analysis and IDE features.",
