  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the boto3 oam service client, enabling type-checked pagination support.",
  "sources": "Imported modules (sys, typing, botocore.paginate, local type_defs), class method parameters, and class inheritance.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept **kwargs, which are unpacked into specific paginator input types; no other untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data (kwargs) flow from method calls into paginate methods, then into the base Paginator's paginate method, with no evident malicious processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code strictly defines type annotations and class structure.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for paginator classes of the boto3 oam client. It imports necessary modules, defines paginator classes with paginate methods, and handles type checking with conditional imports. No data processing, external data handling, or code execution is present. The methods only invoke the underlying Paginator's paginate function with unpacked kwargs, which is standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities. The code appears to be well-structured, intended for type hinting and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, focusing on type annotations for boto3 paginator classes. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It appears safe and aligns with intended use for SDK typing support.",
