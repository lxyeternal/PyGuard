{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and paginator classes for the 'oam' service client in boto3, mainly for improved type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions with untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external or untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines classes and methods with type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard SDK wrapper code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are observed. The use of type annotations and conditional imports is typical for version compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up type definitions and paginator classes for the 'oam' boto3 client, including version-specific imports and conditional typing. It defines three paginator classes, each with a 'paginate' method that uses type unpacking. The code is structured for documentation and type safety, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or unsafe behavior. No external data handling, network activity, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, well-structured SDK wrapper code aimed at enhancing type safety and documentation. No malicious intent or security risks are detected. It functions as a type-annotated interface for boto3 pagination classes without performing any data processing or network activity.",
