  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for a Python SDK client to interact with AWS CloudWatch Observability Access Manager (OAM).",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attribute definitions, method signatures, and property definitions. No runtime input reading or external data fetching is present.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters and return types, which define data flow but do not process untrusted input directly. No external network or file access is performed in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Method signatures indicate data flows from method parameters (unpacked from type defs) to return values or internal processing. No actual data processing is shown, only definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors, are present. The code is primarily type annotations and method signatures aligned with AWS SDK patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations, class structures, and method signatures for an AWS client. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, standard AWS SDK code patterns, and explicit method documentation links. No code executes data processing, network calls, or file operations within this fragment. The functions are interfaces only, with no embedded malicious logic or obfuscated techniques. The absence of runtime code or external data handling reduces risk. The design appears consistent with SDK client definition and type safety enhancement, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface definition with no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It appears to be a legitimate, type-annotated client interface for AWS OAM, with no malicious behavior detected.",
