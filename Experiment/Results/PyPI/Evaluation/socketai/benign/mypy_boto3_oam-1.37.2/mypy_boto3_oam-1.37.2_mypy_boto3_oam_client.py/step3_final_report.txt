  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for the boto3 OAM client, serving as SDK stubs.",
  "sources": "Imports, class attributes, method signatures accepting parameters for AWS API calls.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; parameters flow into AWS API calls, typical for SDK wrappers.",
  "flows": "Method parameters to API endpoints; no internal data processing or external data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface with type annotations, no runtime logic, network activity, or malicious patterns. It uses standard practices for SDK stub definitions, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface for AWS OAM, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from typical SDK parameter handling, not malicious intent.",
