  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the CloudWatch Observability Access Manager (OAM) service, providing structured access to AWS APIs.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party botocore modules, and local modules (.paginator, .type_defs). No direct input sources present.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points observed in the code.",
  "flows": "No actual data flow operations (like network or file I/O) are implemented within this code; it only defines an API interface with method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with standard structure for boto3 client wrappers. No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class and method definitions, type annotations, and imports. No executable logic, data handling, or external data processing is present. The exception class merely defines exception types, no malicious behavior. All methods are designed as API wrappers with documented parameters and return types, following standard boto3 stub conventions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious data manipulation are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured type definition and interface wrapper for AWS boto3 OAM client. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity detected.",
