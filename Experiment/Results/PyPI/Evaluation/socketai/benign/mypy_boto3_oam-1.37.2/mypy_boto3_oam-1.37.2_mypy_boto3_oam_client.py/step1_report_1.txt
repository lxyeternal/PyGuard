  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for the boto3 OAM client, enabling type-safe interaction with AWS CloudWatch Observability Access Manager.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class methods that define API calls; property that accesses exceptions.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data is sent to external systems, no network communication, no file writing, or command execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters (untrusted input) to API calls within the boto3 client methods, but these are standard SDK operations without internal data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. Usage of 'Unpack' and 'Literal' from typing_extensions is standard for type annotations. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, class definitions, method signatures, and docstrings that link to documentation. It defines a client class for AWS OAM with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data processing logic. The class methods are wrappers for AWS API calls with standard type annotations, and the code imports appear legitimate. No indications of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident. The code is well-structured, adheres to conventional patterns for SDK type stubs, and lacks any suspicious logic or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard type stub and SDK interface for AWS boto3 service. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code's purpose is to facilitate type-safe API interaction, with no signs of supply chain attack or sabotage.",
