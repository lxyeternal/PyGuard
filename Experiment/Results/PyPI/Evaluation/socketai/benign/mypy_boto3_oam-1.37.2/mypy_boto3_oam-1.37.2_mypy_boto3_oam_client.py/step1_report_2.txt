  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for interacting with the AWS CloudWatch Observability Access Manager service via boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules. Class methods and properties that define client behavior and exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous functions are generate_presigned_url, tag_resource, untag_resource, and any method that accepts untrusted input for AWS resource operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from untrusted sources (like method arguments) pass into boto3 client methods, which then generate network requests or perform AWS resource modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No evidence of code that performs data exfiltration, system modification, or malicious network activity. Use of 'Unpack' for dynamic parameter passing is standard in boto3 stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a boto3 client wrapper with type annotations for AWS OAM service. The class methods correspond to AWS API actions, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. All functions are documentation-driven wrappers for AWS API calls, and no embedded malicious behavior or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured, and well-annotated AWS SDK client wrapper for the OAM service, with no indications of malicious intent or malware. It mainly facilitates AWS resource management operations without any suspicious behavior.",
