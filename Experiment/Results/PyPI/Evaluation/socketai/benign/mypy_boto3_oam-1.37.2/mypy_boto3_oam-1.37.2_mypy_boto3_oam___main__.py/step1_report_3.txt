  "analysis": "The script serves as a simple CLI tool to display static package info and version. It reads user input via command-line arguments and outputs predefined text. There are no external data sources, no use of environment variables, no network connections, and no insecure code practices. The code is straightforward, with clear separation of concerns, and no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and functions solely as a CLI informational utility. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected.",
