  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Functionality Confirmation**:\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that prints static package info or version details based on command-line arguments.\n   - It uses `sys.argv` to detect if `--version` is present.\n   - It outputs to `sys.stdout` via `sys.stdout.write()`.\n   - There are no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, no secrets, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity & Logical Flaws**:\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious activity.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and based on static analysis.\n   - No report claims any anomalies, obfuscation, or malware, which aligns with the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Over/Underestimation**:\n   - No issues are present that would justify higher risk or malware scores.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious actions, so scores above 0 are unwarranted.\n   - The uniformity across reports suggests consensus and correctness.\n\n5. **Overall Security & Malware Evaluation**:\n   - The code does not contain any malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n   - No obfuscation or vulnerabilities are evident.\n   - The code's purpose is purely informational.\n\n6. **Final Expert Judgment & Scores**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 (correct)\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 (correct)\n   \n   These scores reflect the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a simple, benign CLI utility with no malicious intent.\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores or analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n**Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0**.  \nThe code poses no security threat.",
