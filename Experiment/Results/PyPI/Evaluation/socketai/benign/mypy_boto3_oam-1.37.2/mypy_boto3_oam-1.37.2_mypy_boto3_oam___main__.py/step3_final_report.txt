  "purpose": "Provides static package information and version details via CLI.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) to determine output.",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to stdout; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (`--version`) leads to version info output; otherwise, package info is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with static data, no obfuscation, no secrets, no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on argument presence. It uses only standard modules (`sys`) and performs a basic argument check. There are no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The logic is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0), as the code's simplicity and static behavior leave no room for malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
