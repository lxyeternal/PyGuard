  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility. It reads command-line arguments to determine output, and then prints static informational strings to stdout. There are no untrusted data sources beyond command-line arguments, which are handled simply. No external network connections, no data leaks, and no suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility designed to display package information and version details. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
