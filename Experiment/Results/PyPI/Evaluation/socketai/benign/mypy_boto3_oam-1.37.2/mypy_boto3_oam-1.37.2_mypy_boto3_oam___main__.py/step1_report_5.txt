  "purpose": "CLI tool that outputs package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data to stdout",
  "flows": "Command-line input (e.g., '--version') triggers flow to output version info; otherwise, outputs package info",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; functions are straightforward with no dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and writes output via sys.stdout.write. It has simple control flow based on arguments, with no external data fetching, no environment variable use, and no suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic detected. The code appears to be a standard CLI script for informational purposes. No signs of obfuscation or malware are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package info and version data. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
