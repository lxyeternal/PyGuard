  "flows": "Reads command-line input (sys.argv), then conditionally outputs package info or version to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and informational.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and a main function that responds to '--version' argument. It outputs package metadata without external network calls, file access, or data collection. The code is minimal and serves a display purpose only. No signs of malicious activity or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility for displaying package information and version details. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
