{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface (CLI) entrypoint for a Python package, allowing users to print package info and version.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), reads from sys.stdout for printing information.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "flows": "Checks if '--version' is in sys.argv; if so, calls print_version() and outputs version info. Otherwise, calls print_info() to output package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No external network access, file manipulations, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs basic CLI functions: displaying package info and version. It uses standard Python modules (sys), straightforward conditional logic, and simple string outputs. There are no inputs from untrusted sources beyond command-line arguments, and no data is transmitted externally. The code is clean, with no obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility designed for informational output. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks.",
