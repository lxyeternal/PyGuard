  "purpose": "Type definitions for oam service API, used for type annotations and data structure validation in boto3 client code.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type annotations, and class definitions. No external or untrusted input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not process untrusted data directly, only defines data types.",
  "flows": "N/A. The code is solely type definitions and does not execute runtime logic or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. Usage of conditional imports based on sys.version_info is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. No dynamic code execution, network access, or data handling occurs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code is static and solely defines data types relevant to the AWS boto3 SDK for the oam service.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of type annotations and data structure definitions for the AWS boto3 OAM service. It contains no malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks. It is safe and intended for type safety and documentation purposes.",
