  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the oam service in boto3-stubs, facilitating type safety and clarity in API interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.version_info checks, and the type definition classes which define the shape of data for the API.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data fields like 'Tags', 'Policy', 'ResourceArn', and 'ResourceTypes' where untrusted input could theoretically be processed; however, these are merely data definitions, not executable code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input into the data structures when instantiated, but the code itself does not process or execute this data; it only defines data schemas.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or hidden behavior. The code is straightforward type definition classes with conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code contains conditional imports to maintain compatibility across Python versions and defines numerous TypedDict classes to specify data schemas used in the oam service. No executable logic, data processing, or external calls are present. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All imports are standard and legitimate, and the code strictly provides type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely declarative, defining data schemas with no executable or network-related code. It presents no malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks. It is a typical type annotation module intended to improve developer experience and code correctness.",
