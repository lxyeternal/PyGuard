{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for oam service in boto3, facilitating API responses and request payloads.",
  "sources": "Constantly used Python type hinting modules, imported classes, and data definitions; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; code solely defines data types, no data processing or I/O functions present.",
  "flows": "N/A — as this code only defines types and classes, there are no data flows or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional imports for compatibility; no suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of type definitions using TypedDict, conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions, and explicit module exports. No functions, data processing, or external data handling are present. The absence of any network, file, or system calls, along with the static nature of these definitions, indicates no malicious activity. The code adheres to standard practices for type hinting and documentation, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining types for a boto3 oam service SDK. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected, and it does not perform any data processing or system interactions. It appears safe and standard.",
