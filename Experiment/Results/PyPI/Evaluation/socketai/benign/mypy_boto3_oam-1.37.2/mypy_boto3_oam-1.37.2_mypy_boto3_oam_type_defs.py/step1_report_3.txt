{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations for the OAM service in boto3, providing structured type hints for inputs and outputs of API operations.",
  "sources": "The module sources data from standard libraries (sys, builtins, typing, typing_extensions) and local literals, but only defines static type structures; no data input or external sources are read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that handle untrusted input or output; the code is solely type definition for static analysis.",
  "flows": "This code does not implement runtime data flow; it only declares type annotations used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic code execution are present. The code is purely static type definitions with no runtime logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of TypedDict class declarations to specify data structures used in the AWS OAM service SDK. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, but no data processing, external data handling, or dynamic execution. There are no functions, no input/output handling, and no suspicious code patterns. All type definitions are straightforward and adhere to normal static typing conventions. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static type definition module for boto3's OAM service, with no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It serves as a support layer for type checking and documentation.",
