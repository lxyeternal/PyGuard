  "purpose": "Define static type annotations for AWS OAM service in boto3-stubs, facilitating type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Type definition classes, conditional imports for compatibility, no runtime data handling or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Data fields representing API inputs/outputs; no actual data processing or untrusted data flow occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No runtime flows; purely static class definitions used for type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard conditional imports, straightforward class definitions, no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of TypedDict class definitions for AWS OAM SDK, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It contains no functions, runtime logic, data processing, or external I/O. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate given its static, declarative nature. No anomalies or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of static type annotations for the AWS SDK, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify it as purely static and safe.",
