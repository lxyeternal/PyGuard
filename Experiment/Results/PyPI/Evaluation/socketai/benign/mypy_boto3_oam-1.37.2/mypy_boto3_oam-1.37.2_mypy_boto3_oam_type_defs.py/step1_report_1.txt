{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for oam service type definitions in the boto3_stubs library, including request and response structures for AWS OAM operations.",
  "sources": "Static type definitions and data structures, no dynamic input handling or external data reads.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data flows to insecure or sensitive operations; the code is purely declarative type definitions.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows or processing; the code only declares types and interfaces.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses conditional imports for compatibility, but nothing unusual or suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of TypedDict classes defining data structures for an AWS SDK. It employs conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions, which is standard. No runtime logic, input handling, or data processing is present. The code strictly provides type annotations and documentation. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of type definitions for the boto3 OAM service. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is purely to facilitate type checking and IDE support for the SDK. No malicious intent or security issues are identified.",
