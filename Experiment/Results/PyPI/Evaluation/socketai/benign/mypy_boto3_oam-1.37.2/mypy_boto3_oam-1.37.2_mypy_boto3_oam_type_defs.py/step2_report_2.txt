  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose:** Define type annotations for AWS OAM service in boto3-stubs.  \n- **Findings:** Static type definitions, no dynamic or runtime logic, no external data, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n- **Comments:** The report correctly identifies the code as purely static type definitions with no malicious activity. The reasoning is sound.  \n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's nature. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and data structures for boto3 OAM.  \n- **Findings:** No data processing, no external data, purely static type definitions, no anomalies.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n- **Comments:** The analysis is consistent; the code is static and safe.  \n\n**Conclusion:** No concerns; the assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for the OAM service, no runtime logic.  \n- **Findings:** Entirely static, no data handling, no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n- **Comments:** The reasoning is thorough and accurate; the code is just type definitions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report correctly states the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for the OAM API.  \n- **Findings:** No external or untrusted input processing, static type definitions, no malicious code.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n- **Comments:** The assessment is consistent with the code's static nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and data schemas for boto3-stubs.  \n- **Findings:** No executable logic, no data processing, only data schemas, standard conditional imports.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n- **Comments:** The analysis correctly notes the absence of malicious behavior and confirms the code's static, declarative nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is purely static type definitions with no runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Security Risk:** The risk scores are all 0, consistent with the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior detected.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks associated with static type definitions.\n\n**This code is a standard, well-structured set of static type annotations for AWS SDKs, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.**",
