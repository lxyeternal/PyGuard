  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, correctness of the scoring, and any inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a set of type definitions for AWS OAM SDK, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling. Uses conditional imports for compatibility. No anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct, no malicious activity.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate, purely static type annotations.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct, code is straightforward.  \n- **Conclusion:** Fully benign, standard static type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is only static type definitions, with no runtime or external data handling. No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing static nature, no dynamic or malicious behavior.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security issues, purely static.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Again, only static type definitions, no runtime logic, no external data handling, no anomalies.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard static type annotations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** The report notes that while some fields could be untrusted in real usage, the code itself only defines data schemas, with no processing or executable logic. No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct, no malicious activity.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate, as no actual processing or insecure behavior is present.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Additional note:** The report correctly clarifies that the code is purely declarative and does not process untrusted data directly.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports accurately describe the code as static type definitions with no runtime logic or external data handling.  \n- **Malware score:** Correctly assigned as 0 across all reports.  \n- **Security risk:** Appropriately scored as 0, given the nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscation:** Correctly identified as 0, the code is straightforward.\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\nGiven the thorough analysis, the scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is a well-structured, static set of type annotations for the AWS SDK.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior observed.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk:** 0 — purely static type definitions, no runtime or external data handling.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, benign, and serves as a static type annotation module.",
