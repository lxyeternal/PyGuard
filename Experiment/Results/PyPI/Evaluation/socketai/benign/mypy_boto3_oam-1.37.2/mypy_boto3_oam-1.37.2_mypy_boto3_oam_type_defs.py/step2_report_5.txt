  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports agree that the code is purely static type definitions for the AWS OAM service in boto3-stubs.\n- They highlight the use of conditional imports for compatibility, but no dynamic, runtime, or external data handling.\n- No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are identified.\n- The purpose is to facilitate type checking, documentation, and IDE support.\n- The confidence level in all reports is high (1.0), and no anomalies, malware, or security risks are observed.\n\n**Confirmations and Potential Issues:**\n\n- The code is well-structured, with no runtime logic or data processing.\n- The type annotations align with standard practices.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The use of conditional imports is standard for cross-version compatibility.\n- The data fields are typical for AWS SDK type definitions, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the static, declarative nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward type definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since there are no runtime behaviors, external inputs, or security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations:**\n\n- No report suggests any potential vulnerabilities or security risks beyond the basic static type definitions.\n- The mention of \"sinks\" in report 5 notes that data fields could theoretically be points where untrusted data enters, but since this is purely type definitions, that does not translate into actual security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-implemented set of type annotations for the boto3 OAM SDK.\n- It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: static, well-documented type definitions with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign scores independently, I would concur with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, straightforward, and serves a purely supportive role for static analysis and IDE tooling.",
