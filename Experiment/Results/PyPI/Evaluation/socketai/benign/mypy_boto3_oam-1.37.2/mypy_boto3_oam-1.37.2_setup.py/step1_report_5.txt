{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing the 'mypy-boto3-oam' Python library, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The script reads the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or used in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input from the file system (README.md) flows into the long_description variable, which is then used in the setup() call. No untrusted data is used in dangerous functions or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured Python package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a local README.md file for description, and calls setuptools.setup() with project metadata, dependencies, and URLs. All operations are typical for a setup script. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, and the code does not perform any network operations, data manipulation, or code execution beyond standard package setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a legitimate Python package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It functions solely to configure package distribution with no hidden or malicious code.",
