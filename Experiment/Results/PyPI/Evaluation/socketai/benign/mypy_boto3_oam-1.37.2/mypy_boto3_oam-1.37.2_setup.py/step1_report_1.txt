{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-oam package to configure packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads package data; specifies dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or execution points that process external input or data.",
  "flows": "Reads local files for package description; uses static configuration data; installs dependencies as specified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed. The copyright year is in the future but is likely a typo.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and reads a local README.md file for the long description. It then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and configuration options. There are no dynamic or untrusted inputs processed, nor any code execution based on external data. The code appears standard for a Python package setup script. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
