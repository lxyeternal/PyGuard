  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for mypy-boto3-oam, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static data used in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> calls setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year set to 2025, likely a typo but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic or untrusted input processing. It reads a local file for description and calls setup() with fixed data. No obfuscated code, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's static, benign nature. The minor typo in the copyright year does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign Python package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, and the scores should remain at zero across malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
