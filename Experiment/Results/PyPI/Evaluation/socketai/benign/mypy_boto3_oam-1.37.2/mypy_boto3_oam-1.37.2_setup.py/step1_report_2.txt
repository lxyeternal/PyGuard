{
  "purpose": "This setup script defines the packaging configuration for the mypy-boto3-oam Python library, facilitating its installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup from setuptools, and defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that execute untrusted data or perform malicious actions; no dynamic code execution or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the README.md file into the LONG_DESCRIPTION variable, then into the setup() function, which processes static package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code structures, or suspicious dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads static content for description, and calls setup() with fixed package metadata. There are no external data inputs that could be manipulated, no dynamic code or network operations, and no obfuscated patterns. The install_requires field includes conditional dependencies based on Python version, which is standard practice. The code strictly performs package configuration without executing any runtime logic beyond static data assignment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and designed solely for package configuration.",
