{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-oam' to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setup from setuptools; static string values for package metadata and requirements.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data used or processed in a risky manner.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted input to sensitive sinks; static data used for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. The copyright date is in the future (2025), but that alone isn't malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration. It reads a local README.md file for long description, imports setup from setuptools, and calls setup() with static metadata such as package name, version, author info, classifiers, keywords, URLs, and dependencies. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. No code execution or network activity occurs. The code appears to be straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for packaging, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It follows common practices for Python package configuration. The only minor concern is the future copyright year, which is not inherently malicious.",
