{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-oam' to facilitate package installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for the long description; reads package metadata and configuration data within the script.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or code execution points are present; no dynamic code execution or network operations.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> processes setup configuration -> completes package setup without executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code; standard setup script with no obfuscation or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with static package metadata. It does not perform any network operations, code execution, or data manipulation based on untrusted input. The code appears to be a straightforward package configuration script without suspicious behavior or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks detected. It is safe and typical for its purpose.",
