  "purpose": "Define and store the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; straightforward assignment with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard practice for version declaration. The comment references 'Source of truth for version.' but does not indicate malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple declaration of a version string with a comment header. No input handling, external data, or dynamic execution occurs. The version number appears normal, and the code structure is minimal and standard. No suspicious patterns or obfuscated code are present. The only content is a variable assignment with a comment, which is common in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves a typical purpose in package management without any suspicious elements.",
