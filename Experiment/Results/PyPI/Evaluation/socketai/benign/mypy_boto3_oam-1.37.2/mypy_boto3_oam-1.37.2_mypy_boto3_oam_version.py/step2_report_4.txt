  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no external inputs, no data flows, no dynamic code, and no suspicious constructs.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and serves as metadata. The copyright year being in the future (2025) is unusual but not malicious.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are all 0, aligning with the assessment.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0, which is correct.\n   - The `confidence` scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   \n   **Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all assessments agree there are no malicious behaviors, no reason to assign a higher risk score.\n   - The only anomaly is the future copyright year, but that is not a security concern.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which matches the analysis.\n   - No suspicious or malicious activity is present.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions; they rely on code analysis rather than speculation.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no hidden or dynamic behavior.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard version declaration, typical in Python packages.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security risk score:** 0 (no security issues)\n\nThe only minor point is the future copyright year, which is unusual but not harmful.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- Keep the scores as they are.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|--------------|---------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0             |\n\nThis code is benign and poses no security threat.",
