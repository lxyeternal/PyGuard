  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - No external inputs, data flows, or malicious constructs are identified.\n   - The code is standard for Python package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The only minor point is the future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign scores of 1 for confidence and 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - All scores for malware and security risk are 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n   - Confidence is high (1), supporting the conclusion that the code is safe.\n   - No reason to increase risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware score as 0.\n   - The code does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a straightforward version declaration.\n   - The future copyright year is noted but not considered suspicious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - They accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a standard, harmless version declaration. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's simplicity.",
