  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: a variable assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No external inputs, data flows, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- The code is standard for Python package versioning, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n- The copyright year is 2025, which is in the future, but this alone is not malicious.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is benign and straightforward. No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as a simple, standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - Confidence is 1 for all, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and lack of suspicious content.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - Malware scores are 0, as no malicious activity is detected or suggested.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n   Since the code is purely a version string assignment with no external interactions or malicious constructs, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware considerations:**  \n   - No malicious activity, payload, or obfuscation is present.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, dynamic execution, or data manipulation.\n   - The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments. No changes needed.",
