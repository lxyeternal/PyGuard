  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code review:**\n- The code is a simple assignment: `__version__ = \"1.37.2\"`.\n- It includes a copyright comment.\n- No input/output, no external calls, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- The version string is hardcoded and straightforward.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leaks.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All describe the code as a simple, benign version declaration.\n- They correctly identify no data flow, no external interactions, and no anomalies.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity.\n- Obfuscated: 0, malware: 0, securityRisk: 0 — all consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate for such a trivial, static assignment.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The copyright year is 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date (assuming October 2023). While unusual, this isn't malicious, just a likely typo or placeholder. It does not affect security assessment.\n- No dynamic or suspicious behavior is present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports are consistent with the code.\n- **Any necessary score adjustments?** No. The scores are appropriate.\n- **Any overlooked issues?** No, the code is very straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no security concerns. The provided reports correctly assess the situation, and no score adjustments are needed.",
