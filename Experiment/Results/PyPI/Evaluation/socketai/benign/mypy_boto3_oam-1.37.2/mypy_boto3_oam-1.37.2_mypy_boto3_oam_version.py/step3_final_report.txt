  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a static string for version control.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; straightforward assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025) is unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to __version__, with a comment header. No external data, dynamic code, or obfuscation is involved. The code is standard for Python packages. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. The future copyright year is unusual but not malicious. Scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action required.",
  "confidence": 1,
