  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS services, resource types, regions, and related identifiers for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Literal string definitions and conditional import statements.",
  "sinks": "None; static data with no external input or data flow.",
  "flows": "N/A; no runtime or data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "None; static, straightforward definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string literal type definitions used for type annotations, with conditional imports for compatibility. No dynamic code, external data handling, or network interactions are present. The large lists are static constants intended for static analysis and documentation. No secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are included. The code's purpose is purely for type safety and documentation, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module defining string literals for AWS resource and service identifiers. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
