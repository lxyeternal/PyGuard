  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is purely static, defining string literals for AWS resource and service names, used for type annotations.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, external input, or network interactions are present.\n- The conditional import pattern for 'Literal' based on Python version is standard and safe.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- The large list of literals, while extensive, is static data used for type safety, not malicious.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports indicate any actual issues in the code. The code is straightforward and benign.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident.\n- **Scores assigned:** All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Risk justification:** The risk scores are all zero, justified by the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made that could lead to false positives.\n- **Score consistency:** The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a static, well-structured set of type aliases for AWS resource identifiers.\n- No malicious or obfuscated elements are present.\n- The high confidence scores (1) are justified.\n- No changes needed to the scores or analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, static definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The code serves as a type definition module for static analysis and documentation, with no runtime or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and thorough. The code is safe, static, and intended solely for type annotations. No adjustments are necessary.",
