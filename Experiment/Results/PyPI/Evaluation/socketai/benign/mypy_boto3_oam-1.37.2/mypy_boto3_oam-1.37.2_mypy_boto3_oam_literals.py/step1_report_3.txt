  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS service and resource names for type checking in Python.",
  "sources": "Literal assignments and imports based on Python version for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only defines constants and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static definitions of string literals used for type annotations, which is standard practice. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, and defines multiple constants with specific string values for AWS services, resources, and pagination. No user input handling, external data, or execution flow exists that could be exploited. No suspicious code, obfuscated elements, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module defining type literals for AWS services, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
