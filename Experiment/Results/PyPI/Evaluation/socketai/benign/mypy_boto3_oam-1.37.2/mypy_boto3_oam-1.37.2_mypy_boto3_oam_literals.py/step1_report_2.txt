  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS service literals and enumerations for type safety in Python code.",
  "sources": "Static string literals assigned to variables, import statements for type annotations, conditional import based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no dynamic data or untrusted input sources present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; only static string literals are used, which do not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code solely defines constants and type aliases with no dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version-specific typing modules, then defines a series of string literal types representing AWS resource and service names. It includes a large list of hardcoded string literals assigned to variables with no user input, external data, or runtime data processing. No functions, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to be purely for type safety and documentation purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward collection of type alias definitions for AWS resource and service names, intended for type checking and documentation. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and purely declarative.",
