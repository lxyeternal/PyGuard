{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literals used in AWS-related services and resources, primarily for static type checking in Python.",
  "sources": "Literal string definitions for different AWS service names, resource types, paginators, and regions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines constants and does not process external input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code includes a copyright statement and documentation, but no functional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then declares multiple string literal types representing AWS services, resource types, paginators, regions, etc. The purpose appears to be providing static type annotations for a larger codebase or SDK. There are no functions, no data input/output, and no runtime behavior. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity are detected. The extensive list of literals may seem large, but they are just static constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely provides static type definitions for AWS service constants, with no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
