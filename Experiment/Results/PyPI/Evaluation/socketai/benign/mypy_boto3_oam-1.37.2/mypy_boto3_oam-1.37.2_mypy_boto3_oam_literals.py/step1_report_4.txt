  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS service and resource identifiers used in type annotations and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statement for sys and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines constants and type aliases without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, or malicious constructs detected. No hardcoded secrets or credential-like data present. The code is primarily static type annotations and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' depending on Python version, which is a standard practice. It defines numerous string literal types for use in type annotations, such as service names, resource types, and region names. The code is well-structured, with clear naming and no dynamic execution, external network access, or obfuscation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage. The only potential concern might be the extensive list of resource and service names, which could be misused if incorporated into malicious code, but on its own, they are harmless definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static collection of type aliases for AWS resource and service identifiers, intended for type hinting and documentation support. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and aligns with best practices for type annotations.",
