{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS services and resource identifiers used in boto3 OAM (Observability Access Manager) for type checking.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions and import statements, particularly from sys and typing",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or code execution",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines constants and types",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code behaviors observed. Usage of version checks for conditional imports is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type alias declarations for string literals, used for static type checking with Python's type hints. It imports sys and conditionally imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version, which is a common compatibility pattern. No dynamic execution, data handling, or external input processing occurs. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The large list of AWS resource and service names appears to be static data used for type annotations. The overall structure is straightforward and typical for type definition modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type definition module for AWS resource identifiers, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to improve type safety in code that uses AWS SDKs and does not perform any runtime actions or data processing.",
