  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple interface module, primarily importing classes and defining exports.\n- No data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling is observed.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The documentation and usage examples are standard, with no suspicious patterns.\n- The only unusual element is the future-dated copyright year (2025), which is not inherently malicious but somewhat atypical.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Interface for oam service.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no untrusted data, no suspicious imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Main interface for oam.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Main interface for oam, with class and paginator exports.\n- **Analysis:** Slightly more detailed, mentions the future date in copyright.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Justification for risk=0.1:** The only notable aspect is the future date, which is benign but might be considered a minor anomaly. Since no actual security risk exists, this is acceptable but perhaps slightly overestimated. A risk score of 0.1 is reasonable.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Interface setup for oam client and paginators.\n- **Analysis:** Clear, straightforward, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Provides interface with documentation and imports.\n- **Analysis:** Same as others; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0; the code is purely import/export boilerplate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All agree on 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1 due to the future date in the copyright.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (the code is a benign interface module; the future date is not a security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, benign SDK interface module with no malicious or security concerns. The slight elevation in risk score in one report is justified by the future date but does not indicate any actual security threat.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, for an accurate reflection of the code's benign nature.",
