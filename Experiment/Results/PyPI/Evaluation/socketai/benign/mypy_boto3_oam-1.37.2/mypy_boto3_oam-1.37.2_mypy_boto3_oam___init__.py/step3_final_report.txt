  "purpose": "Main interface for oam service, providing class and paginator imports for SDK usage.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules, documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or data processing present.",
  "flows": "N/A; code does not process data or execute logic.",
  "anomalies": "Future-dated copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes and defines exports for an SDK. It contains no data flow from untrusted sources, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The only minor anomaly is the future year in the comments, which does not impact security. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The code's simplicity and documentation indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SDK interface module with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores should reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk.",
