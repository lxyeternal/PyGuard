  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple interface module, mainly importing classes and defining exports.\n- No untrusted data flows, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The documentation and usage examples are standard.\n- The copyright date is future-dated (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n**Specific points per report:**\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a benign interface layer with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high, given the straightforward nature.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, confirming the code's benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Slightly notes the future date in the copyright but considers it not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the small security risk might be overestimating; since there's no actual security flaw, this should be 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — still very high, but the securityRisk might be slightly inflated.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Confirms the code is a standard interface with no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same conclusion, benign SDK interface.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation and recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify zero malware risk. The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero in all reports, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports give 0 or near-zero. Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**However, the third report assigns a securityRisk of 0.1**, citing the future date in the copyright. This is not a security risk; it is likely a placeholder or typo. Therefore, I recommend **reducing the securityRisk to 0** for all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a straightforward, benign SDK interface module with no security issues or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are consistent in identifying the code as benign.\n- The only adjustment needed is to set the securityRisk to 0 across all reports, as there's no actual security concern.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set at 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** The overall security assessment should be that this code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
