  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple interface layer, mainly importing classes and defining exports.\n- No untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious imports are identified.\n- The code is standard boilerplate for an SDK or client library.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The only unusual element is the copyright year \"2025\" in the code comments, which is future-dated relative to the current date (October 2023). This is likely a typo or oversight, not malicious.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident in any report.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Security risk scores are very low (0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n- The purpose and analysis sections are consistent and thorough.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- The only point worth noting is the future date in the copyright statement. While unusual, it does not indicate malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned seem appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module.\n- No evidence suggests malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware score: **0** (no malicious activity)\n- Obfuscated score: **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- Risk score: **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose as an SDK interface layer. No further action needed.",
