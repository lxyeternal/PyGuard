  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the oam service by importing relevant clients and paginators for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .client and .paginator",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable usage observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from external untrusted sources to sinks; this is a straightforward interface module",
  "anomalies": "Contains only imports and documentation; no code that executes untrusted data or performs suspicious actions",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of importing specific classes and defining an alias and __all__ for exports. The included documentation suggests usage instructions. There are no data inputs, network connections, or executable logic that could be malicious. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "This module acts as a simple interface wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger SDK or library, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
