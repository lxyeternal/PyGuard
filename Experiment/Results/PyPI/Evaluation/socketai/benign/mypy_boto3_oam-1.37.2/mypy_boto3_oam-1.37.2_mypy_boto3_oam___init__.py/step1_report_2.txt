  "purpose": "Provide a main interface for the oam (Observability and Access Management) service, importing and exposing classes and functions for client interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client and .paginator), static string documentation, and module-level assignments.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not process untrusted data or perform network, file, or environment operations.",
  "flows": "N/A, the code does not handle untrusted data flows; it only defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code contains standard import/export statements, inline documentation, and a copyright statement. No hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a simple interface module, importing classes and functions from internal modules and defining a Client alias. It includes documentation and metadata. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This module functions as a straightforward interface layer for the oam service SDK components. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. Its purpose is purely structural, providing access to internal classes.",
