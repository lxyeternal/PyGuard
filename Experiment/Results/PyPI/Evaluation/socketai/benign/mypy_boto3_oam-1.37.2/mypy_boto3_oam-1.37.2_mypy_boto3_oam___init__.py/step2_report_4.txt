  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code is primarily import statements and documentation, with no execution logic.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external data flows are present.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious code.  \n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, acting as a simple interface layer.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is straightforward, with no data handling or suspicious patterns.  \n- The only minor note is the future date in the copyright, which is not malicious.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Also confirms the code is a simple interface, with no data processing, network, or malicious activity.  \n- Slightly notes the future date but considers it benign.  \n- The securityRisk score is 0.1, which is marginally above zero, perhaps reflecting a cautious approach due to the future date.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Reinforces that the code is purely import/export with no data handling or suspicious patterns.  \n- No anomalies or malicious indicators.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Similar findings: straightforward module setup, no malicious code, no data flows, no obfuscation.  \n- The documentation and usage examples are benign.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Summary:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports correctly identify that the code does not contain malicious behavior. The malware score of 0 is justified.  \n- **Obfuscation:** All reports note no obfuscation, which is accurate.  \n- **Risk Score:** The only slight variation is in report 3, which assigns a securityRisk of 0.1, possibly due to the future date in the copyright statement. This is a benign anomaly and does not suggest a real security risk.  \n- **Code Content & Logic:** The code is a minimal, well-structured interface module with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions that could be malicious.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified; the minor future date is not a concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed reviews, the code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a slight over-cautious note in report 3 regarding the future date, which does not warrant a higher risk score.\n\n**My overall estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the nature of the code.",
