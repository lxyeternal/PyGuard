  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for the oam service by importing and exposing specific client and paginator classes from local modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .client and .paginator modules, and the usage example in the comments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations are present; the code only defines imports and exports.",
  "flows": "The code flows from imported modules to assigned variables and exports, with no untrusted data passing through.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The usage example is standard and documentation links are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing classes from internal modules and assigning them to variables or exporting them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code execution, no data handling, and no network operations. The comments include a usage example and documentation link, which are typical and benign. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module interface setup for the oam service client and paginators, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
