  "sources": "Import statements, __jsii_assembly__ loading via jsii.JSIIAssembly.load, publication.publish()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; assembly load is standard and safe",
  "flows": "Import statements -> assembly load -> publish",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup code, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module imports, loads a specific JSII assembly from a tarball, and publishes the module. No dynamic inputs, network operations, or suspicious code are present. The assembly load is typical for AWS CDK modules, and no malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The scores from the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate given the context. The code's simplicity and standard pattern indicate a benign setup with minimal risk, primarily due to external assembly loading, which is common in such infrastructure code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup for an AWS CDK module using JSII. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score (~0.1) reflecting the normal assembly load operation.",
