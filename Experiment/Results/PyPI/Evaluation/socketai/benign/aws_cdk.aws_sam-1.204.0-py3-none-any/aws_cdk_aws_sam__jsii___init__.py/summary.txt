  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup for an AWS CDK module using JSII. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score (~0.1) reflecting the normal assembly load operation."
