  "purpose": "Minimal package metadata and static import of a local module, likely for utility purposes.",
  "sources": "Static import from .file_read_backwards module.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "Import statement is static; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard metadata and import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata (__author__, __email__, __version__) and imports a local module. No runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or secrets are present. The import is static and from a local module, which is typical. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are identified. The only potential concern is the imported module, but without further context, it appears benign. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious code. The security risk is very low, given the minimal code and lack of suspicious activity. Confidence is high due to the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of standard package metadata and a static import. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned are appropriate; further investigation into the imported module is outside this code's scope.",
