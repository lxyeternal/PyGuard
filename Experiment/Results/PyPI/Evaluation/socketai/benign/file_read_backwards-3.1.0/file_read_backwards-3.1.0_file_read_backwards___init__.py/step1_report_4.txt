  "purpose": "This code defines metadata and imports a class from a local module, likely for reading files backwards.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.file_read_backwards'; module metadata definitions (__author__, __email__, __version__)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports a module and sets metadata variables",
  "anomalies": "Use of a relative import in a package, no suspicious or unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets present",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, establishing package metadata and importing a class from a local module. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no external communication. The import is straightforward, and the metadata fields are standard. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as part of a package setup or module definition with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
