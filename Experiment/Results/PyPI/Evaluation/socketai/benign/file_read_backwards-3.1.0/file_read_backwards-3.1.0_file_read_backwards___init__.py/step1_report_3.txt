{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define metadata for a Python package, including author, email, version, and importing a module named 'FileReadBackwards'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .file_read_backwards import FileReadBackwards",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or sensitive data handling observed",
  "flows": "The only flow involves importing a module, which does not process data directly",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard package metadata, no unusual code patterns or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata attributes such as author, email, and version, and imports a single module. The import is relative and only references a class or function from another module. There are no code execution, no data handling, no network operations, or cryptographic functions. The email address appears to be a personal email but no credentials or secrets are hardcoded. No obfuscation or suspicious language features are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple metadata and import statement for a Python package. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are present.",
