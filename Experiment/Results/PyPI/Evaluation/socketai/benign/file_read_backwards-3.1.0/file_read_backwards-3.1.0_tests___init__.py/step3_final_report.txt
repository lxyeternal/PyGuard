{
  "purpose": "This code contains only a UTF-8 encoding declaration, serving as a source file header or placeholder.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only a comment line declaring encoding.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is purely declarative with no execution or data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a standard encoding declaration with no suspicious or unusual features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard header line specifying UTF-8 encoding, common in Python 2 files. It contains no executable logic, data input/output, or malicious patterns. All reviews correctly identify its benign nature. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are consistently zero across all reports, aligning with the code's harmless, declarative purpose. Given the absence of any executable or suspicious content, the code poses no security threat and is typical of placeholder or header files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, contains no malicious behavior or obfuscation, and poses no security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
