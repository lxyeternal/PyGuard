  "purpose": "The code contains only a UTF-8 encoding declaration and no executable logic or functional code.",
  "sources": "No data input sources or external data reads are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, outputs, or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or control flows are evident due to the absence of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "The file contains only a coding declaration without any actual code, which is unusual for a functional script but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is minimal, consisting solely of a coding declaration line. It does not include any functions, imports, or executable statements. There are no source or sink points, no data flows, and no anomalies in behavior or structure. This suggests the file is either incomplete or intentionally minimal. As it stands, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is non-functional and contains only a declaration of encoding. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely an incomplete or placeholder file.",
