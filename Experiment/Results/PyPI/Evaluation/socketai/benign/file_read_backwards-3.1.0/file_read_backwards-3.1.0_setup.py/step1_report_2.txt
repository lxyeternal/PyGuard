  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the Python project 'file_read_backwards'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files for long description; no user input or external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output that could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "Reading static files to build package metadata; no data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard setup.py content with no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and reads static files to compile package metadata. It defines requirements and test requirements as empty or with known safe dependencies. The setup() function specifies package info, author details, URL, and classifiers with no user input or runtime data processing. There are no suspicious code patterns, malicious behaviors, or potential attack vectors. The code appears to be a straightforward setup script intended for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply configures the package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
