  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup script.\n- Sources: Reads static files.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static data only.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Conventional, no dynamic code, no suspicious constructs.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent or security risks.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup script.\n- Sources: Static files.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Straightforward, no suspicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Standard package setup.\n- Sources: Static files.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical setup.py, no dynamic or malicious code.\n- Conclusion: No security issues.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Standard package setup.\n- Sources: Static files.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Conventional, no suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup script.\n- Sources: Static files.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical, no suspicious code.\n- Conclusion: Benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or suspicious behavior:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns observed.\n- **Malware risk:** No evidence of malware or malicious intent.\n- **Security risk:** The code is a straightforward setup script, with no external data handling, dynamic code execution, or network operations.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, as there's no indication of any security concern.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as standard and benign.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all observations are based on static code analysis.\n- The code's purpose is purely package configuration, with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, safe setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and overall risk.",
