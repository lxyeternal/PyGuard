  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, network operations, or user input handling are present.\n- The code reads static files ('README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst') for long descriptions.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the script as a standard setup.py.\n- **Errors or anomalies:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- Same as above, consistent reasoning, no anomalies, malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n### Report 3\n- Same conclusions, standard setup script, no suspicious activity, malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n### Report 4\n- Same consistent analysis, no issues, malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n### Report 5\n- Same, straightforward, no anomalies, malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is a typical, well-structured setup.py script.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected; malware score should remain 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present; obfuscated=0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any suspicious activity, the overall security risk remains 0.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- No need to increase any scores.\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
