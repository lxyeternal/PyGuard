  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, reading static files for long description and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads static files 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' for long description content.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Static data flow from files to package description; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static 'setup.py' script following standard practices. It reads static files, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input handling. All signals point to benign, well-structured packaging code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its safe and straightforward nature. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and overall security risk score 0, consistent with the static, non-suspicious code.",
