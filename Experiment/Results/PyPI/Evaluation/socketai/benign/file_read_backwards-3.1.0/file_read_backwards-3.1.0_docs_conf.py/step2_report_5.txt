  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The script is a typical Sphinx configuration file. It imports standard modules, manipulates sys.path to include the project root, and imports 'file_read_backwards' solely to access its version. No external connections, data exfiltration, or malicious logic are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Fully benign, accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on path manipulation and module import. No suspicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a standard configuration script. No network activity, no data leaks, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; standard setup, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous; no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code does not perform any network operations, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, all risk scores are appropriately zero.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No changes needed. The code is a standard, safe configuration script with no security concerns.",
