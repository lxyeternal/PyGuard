  "purpose": "The package serves as a test launcher for the Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist project, providing all possible cleaners.",
  "sources": "Author contact information, license information, and copyright notices embedded in the comments",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing, network, or file operations observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sinks; primarily metadata and comments",
  "anomalies": "Presence of contact info with obfuscated email 'contactTATAfunilrysTODTODcom' which may be an attempt to hide or obfuscate the email address",
  "analysis": "The code is mostly composed of comments, license texts, and metadata with no executable logic or data processing. The contact email appears obfuscated but is only part of comments, not actual code execution. There are no inputs, outputs, or suspicious code patterns. The obfuscated email may be intended to prevent easy scraping but does not represent malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code consists solely of documentation, licensing, and author information with no executable or suspicious code segments. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
