{
  "purpose": "This code provides licensing, author, and project information for the Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist project; it contains no executable logic.",
  "sources": "Comments containing license text, author info, and contact obfuscation within the code header.",
  "sinks": "No data input or output points; no untrusted data flows or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "None, as the code consists solely of static comments and licensing information.",
  "anomalies": "Minor obfuscation of contact email addresses (e.g., 'contactTATAfunilrysTODTODcom') in comments, which is non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely documentation with no executable components. No data flows, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The contact info obfuscation is superficial and typical for privacy or anti-scraping measures, not malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware and security risk scores of 0, with low obfuscation scores (~0.2) reflecting minor comment obfuscation. Confidence in these assessments is high, given the static, comment-only content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only licensing and author information. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified; no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
  "malware": 0,
