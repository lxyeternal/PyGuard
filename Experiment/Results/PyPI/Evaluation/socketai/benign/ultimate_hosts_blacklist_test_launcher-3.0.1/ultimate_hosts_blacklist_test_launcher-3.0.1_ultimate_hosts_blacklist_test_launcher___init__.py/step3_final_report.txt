  "purpose": "This code serves as a header or metadata block for the Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist project, containing licensing, author, and version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string assignment (__version__ = \"3.0.1\") and the comments containing metadata.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code is static metadata with no input/output or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward comments and a variable assignment with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments with licensing and author info, plus a version variable assignment. There are no functions, input/output, or executable logic. No obfuscation, malicious code, or data flows are present. The code is benign and purely metadata, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign header containing only comments and a version variable. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
