  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines a `CleanerBase` class with:\n     - A list `STD_FILES_TO_IGNORE` containing benign filenames.\n     - An `execute_if_authorized` decorator that runs methods only if `self.authorized` is `True`.\n     - An `authorized` property that always returns `False`.\n     - A `start()` method decorated with `execute_if_authorized`, raising `NotImplementedError` if called.\n\n2. **Security Implications**:\n   - The class is clearly a template or base class meant to be extended.\n   - The `authorized` property always returns `False`, preventing execution of `start()` unless overridden.\n   - No external inputs, network calls, or data leaks are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns.\n   - No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are evident.\n\n3. **Assessment of Risks**:\n   - The code is benign, intended as a foundational class.\n   - The decorator pattern is standard and not malicious.\n   - The always-false `authorized` property suggests it's a template or intentionally disables execution until properly overridden.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious activity, payload, or suspicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — the code is a safe template with no security risks.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns**:\n   - The only \"anomaly\" is that `authorized` always returns `False`, which might be a concern if someone expects it to be `True`. However, this is clearly intentional for a base class meant to be extended.\n   - No signs of supply chain attack or malicious intent.\n\n**Final evaluation**:\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Score | Justification                                               |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 | No malicious code or payload present.                        |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 | Clear, straightforward code.                                |\n| Security Risk  | 0                 | No vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious behavior.        |\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a benign, foundational template for cleaner classes.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The scores provided in the reports are reasonable, but the overall assessment aligns with a **malware score of 0**, **obfuscated score of 0**, and **risk score of 0**.\n\n**Note**: The reports correctly identify that the code is a safe base class with no security issues. The only \"anomaly\" is the always-false `authorized` property, which is intentional and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation**: Based on this review, I agree with the provided scores, and I would assign all scores as zero, reflecting the benign nature of this code snippet.",
