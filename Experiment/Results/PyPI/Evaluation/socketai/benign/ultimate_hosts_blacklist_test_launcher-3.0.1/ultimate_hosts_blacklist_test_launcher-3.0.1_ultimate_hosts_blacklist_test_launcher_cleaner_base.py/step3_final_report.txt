{
  "purpose": "This code provides a foundational base class for cleaners, intended for extension in a larger system.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines class attributes and properties internally.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the class is a template with no active data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The 'authorized' property always returns False, which disables execution of 'start()' unless overridden; this is intentional for a base class, not an anomaly.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a benign, straightforward base class with a list of files to ignore and a decorator controlling method execution based on authorization. The 'authorized' property always returns False, preventing 'start()' from executing unless overridden. No external inputs, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The structure is standard, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The design indicates a template meant for extension, with no security risks or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious template for a cleaner system. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The always-false 'authorized' property is an intentional design choice for subclasses. The scores in the reports are accurate; I confirm a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The code poses no threat and is suitable for use as a benign foundation.",
