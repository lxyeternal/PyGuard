{
  "purpose": "Defines a base class for cleaners with authorization checks, meant to be extended for specific cleaning tasks.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or untrusted input sources are used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potential data leaks or actions triggered by untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily defines class structure and decorators.",
  "anomalies": "The authorization property always returns False, meaning the start method is never executed. The class appears incomplete or designed as a template.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base class 'CleanerBase' with a list of ignored files and an authorization mechanism. The execute_if_authorized decorator ensures that the start method executes only if 'self.authorized' is True, which currently always returns False, preventing execution. No external inputs, environment variables, or network interactions are present. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a foundational template rather than a complete implementation, with no malicious logic or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, foundational class template with no malicious intent or security issues. It merely sets up a structure for further extension. Its design intentionally prevents execution of 'start' unless overridden. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
