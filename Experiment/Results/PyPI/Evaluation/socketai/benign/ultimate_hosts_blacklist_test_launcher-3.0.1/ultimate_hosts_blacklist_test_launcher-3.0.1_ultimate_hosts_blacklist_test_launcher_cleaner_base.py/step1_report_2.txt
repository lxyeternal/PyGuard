  "purpose": "Provides a base class for cleaners in the Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist project, handling authorization and execution control.",
  "sources": "Imports 'functools' and 'List' from 'typing'. The code itself does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output functions are present. No data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code mainly defines a class with methods and properties.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or backdoors are present. The 'authorized' property always returns False, which means the 'start' method cannot be executed unless overridden.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base class for cleaners with an authorization decorator. The decorator ensures that certain methods only run if 'self.authorized' is True. Currently, 'authorized' always returns False, preventing 'start' from executing unless overridden in a subclass. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious patterns are evident. The license and author comments do not introduce suspicious behavior. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to common design patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign foundation for cleaner classes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on subclasses to implement authorization logic and cleaning behavior. No malware, data leakage, or suspicious activity detected.",
