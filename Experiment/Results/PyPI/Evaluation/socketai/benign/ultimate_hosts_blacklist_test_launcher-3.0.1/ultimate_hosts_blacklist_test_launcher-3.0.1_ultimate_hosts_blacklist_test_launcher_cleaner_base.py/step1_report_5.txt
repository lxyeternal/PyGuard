{
  "purpose": "Provides a base class for cleaners in the Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist project, including authorization control for execution.",
  "sources": "Imports from functools and typing, class attribute STD_FILES_TO_IGNORE, method decorators, and property methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external effects; the code mainly defines class structure and authorization logic.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; authorization check via property and decorator gating execution of start().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; the code appears to be a standard base class with authorization control.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for cleaning operations with an authorization mechanism. The execute_if_authorized decorator restricts method execution based on self.authorized, which always returns False in this snippet. No data is read from external inputs, and no malicious activities are evident. The code is standard for access control and does not contain obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical base class with authorization gating, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain attacks. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
