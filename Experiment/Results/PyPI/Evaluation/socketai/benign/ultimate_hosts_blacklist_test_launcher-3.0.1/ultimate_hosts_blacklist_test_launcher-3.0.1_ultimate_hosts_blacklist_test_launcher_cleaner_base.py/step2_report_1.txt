  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code defines a `CleanerBase` class with:\n  - A list `STD_FILES_TO_IGNORE` containing benign filenames.\n  - An `execute_if_authorized` decorator that only executes the decorated method if `self.authorized` is `True`.\n  - An `authorized` property that always returns `False`.\n  - A `start()` method marked as `NotImplementedError`, meant to be overridden.\n\n**Security and Malware Assessment:**\n- The code is a foundational template, intended for extension.\n- The `authorized` property always returning `False` effectively disables the `start()` method unless overridden in a subclass.\n- No external inputs, network calls, or data leaks are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious logic.\n- The decorator pattern and class design are standard and benign.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are evident.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious behavior or code patterns are present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — As a benign, template class, it does not pose security risks.\n\n**Potential Concerns or Clarifications:**\n- The always-false `authorized` property suggests this class is meant as a base to be extended, with subclasses providing actual authorization logic.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- The code's design is standard for plugin or modular systems.\n\n**Overall Recommendation:**\n- The code is safe, non-malicious, and serves as a benign foundation for further extension.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a straightforward, safe template with no security issues or malware indicators.",
