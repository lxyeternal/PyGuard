  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code defines a `CleanerBase` class with:\n  - A list of ignored files (`STD_FILES_TO_IGNORE`), which contains benign filenames.\n  - An `execute_if_authorized` decorator that runs methods only if `self.authorized` is `True`.\n  - An `authorized` property that always returns `False`.\n  - A `start()` method that raises `NotImplementedError`, intended to be overridden.\n\n**Security Implications:**\n- The class is a template for subclasses; by default, it prevents execution of `start()` because `authorized` always returns `False`.\n- No external inputs, network calls, or data processing are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns.\n- The decorator and class structure are standard and benign.\n\n**Review of the reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a benign, foundational template with no malicious behavior.\n- They note that `authorized` always returns `False`, which disables execution unless overridden.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or security risks are identified.\n- The overall confidence is high that this is a safe, standard base class.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's benign nature, a low risk score (~0.1) is appropriate, mainly reflecting that it's a template awaiting extension.\n\n**Potential issues or points of critique:**\n- The `authorized` property always returning `False` could be seen as a limitation, but as this is a base class, it’s expected that subclasses will override it.\n- No security vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present.\n- The code does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a safe, standard base class for a plugin-like system.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to being a template, not active code)\n- **Security risk:** Very low, as no active or malicious code exists.\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The reports are accurate; no changes needed.\n- The code is intentionally minimal and safe, serving as a foundation for further extension.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis supply chain security incident report correctly identifies the code as benign with no malicious or security concerns. The scoring aligns well with the analysis.",
