  "purpose": "Provides a base class for cleaners in the Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist project, including authorization checks and a method decorator.",
  "sources": "The class attribute STD_FILES_TO_IGNORE; the property authorized; the method start.",
  "sinks": "The decorator execute_if_authorized that conditionally calls the start method.",
  "flows": "authorized property -> execute_if_authorized wrapper -> start method",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; the authorized property always returns False, which prevents execution of start(). No external input handling or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base class for cleaning modules with a focus on authorization-controlled execution. The STD_FILES_TO_IGNORE list contains benign file names. The execute_if_authorized decorator ensures methods are only run if self.authorized is True; however, as authorized always returns False, the decorated start() method will never execute. No user input, network calls, or other suspicious behavior observed. The structure appears standard for a plugin-like system. No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a safe, standard base class with no malicious behavior or security risks. It implements a permission check that currently disables execution, likely intended for subclass implementation. No malicious code or supply chain security issues identified.",
