  "purpose": "Provides a base class for cleaners in the Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist project, including authorization control for execution.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; static class attributes and properties.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base class with a decorator to control method execution based on an 'authorized' property, which always returns False. The decorator prevents the 'start' method from executing unless 'authorized' returns True. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows involving untrusted data. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present; the code appears to be a standard, safe foundation for subclasses. No obfuscated code or malware indicators are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious base class implementing authorization control. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The 'start' method is intentionally disabled by default. Overall, it is a benign, standard code structure with no security concerns.",
