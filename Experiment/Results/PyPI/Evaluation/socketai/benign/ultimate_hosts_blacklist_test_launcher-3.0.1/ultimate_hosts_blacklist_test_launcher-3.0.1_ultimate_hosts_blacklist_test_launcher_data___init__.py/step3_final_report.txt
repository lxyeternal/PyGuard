  "purpose": "This code serves as the header, license, and metadata for the Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist project, providing attribution and licensing information without executing any logic.",
  "sources": "The comments contain author info, license text, and project description; no data input or external sources are read.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to leaks or effects, as the code is purely comments.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code contains only static comments with no runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward documentation with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely composed of comments, license, and author information, with no executable statements or data processing. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero. The content does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements, and the scores are consistent with the code's static, documentation-only nature. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only license and metadata comments. It does not include any malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero. No further action is necessary.",
