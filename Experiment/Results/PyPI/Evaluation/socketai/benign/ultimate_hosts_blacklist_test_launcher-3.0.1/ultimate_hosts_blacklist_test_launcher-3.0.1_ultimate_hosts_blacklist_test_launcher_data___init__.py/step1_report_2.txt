  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is observable, as the code mainly consists of comments and license information.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of author contact information in plain text; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. No hardcoded secrets or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a license and description header with no executable code, input handling, or data processing. It contains licensing terms and author metadata. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The absence of executable code, combined with standard licensing comments, indicates this is a non-malicious code snippet. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign license and metadata header with no executable logic or security concerns. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
