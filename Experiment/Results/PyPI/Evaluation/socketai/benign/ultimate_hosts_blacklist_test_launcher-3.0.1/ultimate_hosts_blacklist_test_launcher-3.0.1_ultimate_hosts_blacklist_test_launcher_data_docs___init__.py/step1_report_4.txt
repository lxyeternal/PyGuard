  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input or external data sources; only static comments are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code contains only descriptive comments and licensing information without executable logic.",
  "analysis": "The script consists solely of comments outlining project details, author info, licensing, and copyright notices. There are no functions, data processing, or code execution flows that could be exploited. Since no code reads or writes data, and no dynamic or executable content is present, the likelihood of malicious behavior is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving purely as documentation and metadata. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
