  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable as the code is primarily a descriptive comment.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of contact information with suspicious placeholder 'contactTATAfunilrysTODTODcom', which may be intentionally obfuscated or a placeholder. No executable code or dynamic behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments including license, author, and project descriptions. There are no executable statements, input handling, or data processing. The contact email appears obfuscated or placeholder, which could be intentional to prevent scraping but is not malicious. The absence of code logic, data processing, or network activity indicates no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely documentation with no executable or data-processing components. It does not contain malware or security risks. The contact info may be obfuscated, but this does not constitute malicious activity.",
