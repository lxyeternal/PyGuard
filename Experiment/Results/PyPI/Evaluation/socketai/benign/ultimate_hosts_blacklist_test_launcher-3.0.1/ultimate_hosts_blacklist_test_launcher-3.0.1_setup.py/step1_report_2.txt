{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the Python package 'test_launcher' for the Ultimate Hosts Blacklist project, including extracting requirements, version, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements.txt, __init__.py for version info, and README.md for description.",
  "sinks": "No unsafe sinks detected; all data reads are from static files within the project.",
  "flows": "Reading static files to gather package metadata; no untrusted data flow or external input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, defines functions to read static project files (requirements, version, README), and calls setup() with package metadata. No dynamic execution, user input handling, or external data fetching is present. All operations involve static, local files. Entry points are defined for console scripts, which are standard practice. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected. It solely reads local static files for package configuration. The code appears safe for use.",
