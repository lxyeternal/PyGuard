  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup for a Python package, with no suspicious or malicious code. It reads static files and configures package metadata.\n\n- **Findings:** No untrusted input handling, no obfuscation, no external network activity, and no malicious intent. The code adheres to typical packaging practices.\n\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues detected. The report's assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a typical setup script that reads static files for package info.\n\n- **Findings:** No unsafe data handling, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior. All operations are local and static.\n\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is correct; no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard setup script reading local files for package configuration.\n\n- **Findings:** The only potential concern noted is that reading from files could be problematic if files are maliciously modified, but this is a normal part of package setup. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, which seems appropriate given the static nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent; the report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard package setup.\n\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no network activity, no obfuscation. The process involves reading local files and configuring package metadata.\n\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, matching the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe; the report's conclusion is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also describes a typical setup process, reading static files and setting up package info.\n\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscated code, no external network activity, no malicious intent.\n\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, consistent with the findings.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe; the assessment is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, which is justified. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malware.\n\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the static, read-only file operations and absence of external or dynamic code execution.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\nGiven the consistent findings across all reports and the actual code content, I concur with the assessments. The code is a typical, safe packaging script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign, standard nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured setup script for a Python package, with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. All reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
