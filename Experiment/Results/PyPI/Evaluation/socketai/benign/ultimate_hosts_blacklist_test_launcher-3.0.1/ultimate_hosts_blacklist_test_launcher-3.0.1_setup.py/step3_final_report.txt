  "purpose": "This script configures the packaging and distribution of the 'test_launcher' module for the Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist project, setting up metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static files: requirements.txt, __init__.py, README.md",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input is processed at runtime",
  "flows": "Reads static files to extract requirements, version, and description; passes data to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior; standard setup procedures",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file reads and package configuration without executing untrusted code or network operations. It uses regex to extract version info and reads requirements from a text file, all of which are standard practices. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external data handling is present. The setup function is called with static, well-defined parameters. No anomalies or risky patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code's behavior is predictable and safe.",
