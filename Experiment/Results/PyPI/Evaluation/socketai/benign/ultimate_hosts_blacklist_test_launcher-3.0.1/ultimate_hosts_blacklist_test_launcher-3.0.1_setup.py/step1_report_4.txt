  "purpose": "The script is a setup utility for packaging and distributing a Python project related to the Ultimate Hosts Blacklist, primarily handling package metadata, requirements, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, '__init__.py' for version info, and 'README.md' for description; also reads files during package setup.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes untrusted data or performs network operations. No use of insecure eval or exec, no system command execution, no data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Reads data from local files (requirements, version, description) to configure package metadata; no data flows to external systems or networks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard setup tools and file reading procedures. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks: extracting requirements, version, and description from local files, then calling setuptools.setup() with standard parameters. All operations are typical for Python packaging. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. It appears safe and legitimate.",
