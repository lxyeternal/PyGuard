{
  "purpose": "This module contains a hook to integrate with Apache Cassandra, managing connections, policies, and executing queries within an Airflow environment.",
  "sources": "Connection parameters (host, port, login, extra configuration), user inputs for table names and keys in methods like 'table_exists' and 'record_exists'.",
  "sinks": "Constructed CQL queries using sanitized inputs; no direct data leaks or external data flows detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (table names, keys) flow into sanitized methods and parameterized queries, preventing injection; connection setup flows from configuration to cluster and session objects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '_sanitize_input' with regex restricts inputs to word characters, which is a good security practice; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a Cassandra connection with configurable policies and SSL options, employing input validation to prevent injection. Query construction uses parameterized statements, reducing injection risk. No malicious behaviors, external network activity, or obfuscation are present. The validation method '_sanitize_input' ensures only safe table and key names are used. The overall structure follows standard practices for secure database interaction within an Airflow hook.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Cassandra hook with proper input validation and safe query practices. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain sabotage are evident. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard security measures and configuration safety.",
