  "purpose": "Static function returning package metadata for apache-airflow-providers-apache-cassandra, including versions, dependencies, and documentation links.",
  "sources": "No external input; static data within the function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sinks; purely static return value.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code, auto-generated, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Python function that returns a dictionary with package info, versions, dependencies, and documentation URLs. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The structure and comments indicate auto-generation. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration provider with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
