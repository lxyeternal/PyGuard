  "purpose": "This code provides metadata and configuration details for the Apache Cassandra provider package in Apache Airflow, including version info, integrations, sensors, hooks, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data returned by the get_provider_info() function; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects; no data output beyond returning static dictionary.",
  "flows": "Function call to get_provider_info() returns static data; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious code constructs detected. All code is straightforward and appears auto-generated documentation/configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function returning a static dictionary with package metadata and dependencies. It contains no user input, no external data reading, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors. The comments indicate it is auto-generated, with no signs of malicious obfuscation or code injection. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or other malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard auto-generated configuration data provider for an Apache Airflow provider package. It shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
