  "purpose": "Provide metadata and configuration details for the Apache Cassandra provider module in Apache Airflow.",
  "sources": "The data is hardcoded within the get_provider_info() function, primarily static strings and lists.",
  "sinks": "There are no dynamic data sinks, untrusted data processing, or external data transmission points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; data is static configuration info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and auto-generated.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function returning static metadata about the Apache Cassandra provider, including version info, dependencies, and documentation URLs. No user input, external data sources, or network operations are present. The structure and content suggest standard auto-generated configuration code for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated metadata provider for the Apache Cassandra Airflow provider module. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies.",
