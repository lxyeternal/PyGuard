{
  "purpose": "The code provides metadata and configuration information for the Apache Cassandra provider module in Apache Airflow, including version info, dependencies, and integration details.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata from the function return statement; no external input sources or data inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or user input. The code only returns predefined static information.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the function simply returns static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is straightforward and static, with no dynamic or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single function returning a static dictionary with package metadata, versions, dependencies, and documentation links. It does not process or execute any untrusted data or perform any actions beyond returning this data. No signs of malware, malicious code, or security issues are detected. The content appears to be auto-generated documentation/configuration data for an Airflow provider package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static data return function providing package metadata for an Apache Airflow provider. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
