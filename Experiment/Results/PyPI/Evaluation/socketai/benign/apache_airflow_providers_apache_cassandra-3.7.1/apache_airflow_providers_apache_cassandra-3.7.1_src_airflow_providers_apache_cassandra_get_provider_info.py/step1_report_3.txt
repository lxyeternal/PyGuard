{
  "purpose": "This code defines metadata for an Apache Airflow provider package for Apache Cassandra, including package information, versions, integrations, sensors, hooks, connection types, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata and configuration data, including package info, version list, URLs, and module names.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; no output or external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "The code flows from static data definitions towards returning the data as a dictionary, with no user input or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The source date epoch is a static timestamp; the URL and documentation links are static and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of a static function returning a dictionary with package metadata. It does not process user input, execute dynamic code, or interact with external systems beyond URLs for documentation. The data appears to be pre-generated or template-driven, with no suspicious logic or hidden mechanisms. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a metadata provider for a Python package, containing static information about the package's versions, integrations, and dependencies. It does not contain malicious code, hidden backdoors, or security risks. The code appears legitimate and safe.",
