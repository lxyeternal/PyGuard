  "purpose": "Provides metadata and configuration information for the Apache Cassandra provider in Apache Airflow.",
  "sources": "No direct sources of untrusted input; static code with hardcoded strings and data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or external data processing.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the function returns static data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code appears to be auto-generated configuration metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Python function returning a dictionary containing package information, version lists, integrations, sensors, hooks, connection types, and dependencies. No input handling, external data processing, or dynamic code execution is present. It lacks any obfuscated or suspicious code constructs. The license and comment headers are standard, and the content is consistent with auto-generated documentation or configuration data for an Apache Airflow provider package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, static configuration/data definition for the Airflow Cassandra provider. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks are detected.",
