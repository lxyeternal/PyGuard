  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet, which is an auto-generated module performing a version check for Apache Airflow.\n- The code imports `airflow.__version__`, parses it, and raises a RuntimeError if the version is below 2.9.0.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code behaviors are indicated.\n- The code is standard, license-compliant, and typical for dependency version validation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code:**  \n  No, all reports agree that the code performs a straightforward version check with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n- **Errors or mistakes:**  \n  No, the reasoning in all reports is accurate. The code logic is correct, and the interpretation that it enforces version compatibility is sound.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Confidence:**  \n  All reports assign high confidence (1 or 0.9), which seems appropriate given the code's simplicity and clarity.\n- **Obfuscated:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation.\n- **Malware:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Security risk:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The **malware score of 0** is justified; the code is standard and does not perform any malicious activity.\n- The **risk scores** are all very low (0 or 0.1), which aligns with the code's benign purpose.\n- The **version check logic** is standard practice, and no assumptions or risky behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  No, all reports correctly identify the code as standard and safe.\n- **Any inconsistencies or unreasonable scores?**  \n  No, the scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven all the information, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is a straightforward, auto-generated compatibility check with no malicious intent.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to the potential for runtime exceptions, but standard in version checks)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
