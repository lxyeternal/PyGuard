  "purpose": "This code performs a version check for the Apache Airflow package, ensuring the installed version meets the minimum required version (2.9.0).",
  "sources": "Reads the installed airflow.__version__ and the base version for comparison.",
  "sinks": "Raises a RuntimeError if the version is below 2.9.0, halting execution.",
  "flows": "Imports airflow.__version__, parses it, compares it to the minimum version, and raises an exception if incompatible.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version validation logic with no suspicious or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated module enforcing version compatibility for an Apache Airflow provider. It imports the airflow version, parses it, and raises an error if the version is below 2.9.0. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The logic is clear, and the purpose is to prevent runtime issues due to incompatible versions. All signals indicate benign, intended functionality with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign version check with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with its purpose, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
