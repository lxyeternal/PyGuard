  "purpose": "The code initializes version compatibility checks for an Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring that the installed Airflow version meets minimum requirements.",
  "sources": "Reads the Airflow version from the imported 'airflow.__version__' variable.",
  "sinks": "The version comparison logic may raise an exception if the version is below 2.9.0, terminating execution.",
  "flows": "The source (airflow_version) flows into the version comparison and potential exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and configuration-oriented.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and performs a version check to enforce minimum Airflow version requirement. It raises a RuntimeError if the version is too low. No external data is used beyond the imported airflow version, and no malicious actions or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility check with no malicious intent. It ensures proper environment setup for the package without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
