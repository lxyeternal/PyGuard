{
  "purpose": "This code initializes metadata for an Apache Airflow provider package, checks for Airflow version compatibility, and raises an error if the version is below a threshold.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version from the imported __version__ attribute and the packaging.version module for version parsing.",
  "sinks": "The version check potentially raises a RuntimeError if the condition is met.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules and reading the airflow version, then comparing versions, to raising an exception if the condition is true.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior; the code uses standard imports, version comparison, and exception raising. No hardcoded secrets or hidden code, no dynamic execution or external data sources.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical initialization file that sets the package version, performs a version check for compatibility, and raises an error if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0. The use of the __future__ import, standard library imports, and version parsing is standard practice. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard setup script for a Python package with version validation. No malware or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
