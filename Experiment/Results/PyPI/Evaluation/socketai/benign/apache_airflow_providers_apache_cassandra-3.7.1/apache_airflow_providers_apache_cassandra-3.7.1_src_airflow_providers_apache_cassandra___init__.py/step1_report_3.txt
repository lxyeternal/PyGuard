{
  "purpose": "This code defines version checks and licensing information for an Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring compatibility with specific Airflow versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version from the imported `airflow.__version__` and the local `__version__` string.",
  "sinks": "The version comparison and potential RuntimeError exception could halt execution if conditions are not met; no other sinks involving untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing dependencies, defining the package version, checking the Airflow version, and raising an exception if the version is too low.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The version comparison logic is straightforward; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. The comment indicates this is an auto-generated file.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs a version check to ensure compatibility. It imports the airflow version and compares it with a minimum required version. If the installed airflow version is below 2.9.0, it raises an exception to prevent incompatible usage. The code includes licensing and license-related comments, as well as a note that it is auto-generated. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code. The logic is standard for version compatibility enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign version check for compatibility, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is an auto-generated configuration script with no suspicious behavior.",
