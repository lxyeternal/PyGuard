{
  "purpose": "This code manages version compatibility for an Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring the installed Airflow version meets the minimum required version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the installed Airflow version via the import 'airflow.__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing of untrusted input occurs; the code primarily performs version comparison.",
  "flows": "The source (airflow.__version__) is parsed and compared to a hardcoded minimum version ('2.9.0'). If the version is below this, it raises a RuntimeError.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and performs version checking.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version management libraries, retrieves the installed Airflow version, compares it against a minimum required version, and raises an exception if the requirement isn't met. It contains licensing comments and a generated code notice, but no suspicious or malicious activity is evident. No external inputs are processed unsafely, and no data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic version check to enforce compatibility, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard in nature and appears safe.",
