{
  "purpose": "This code is an auto-generated module for Apache Airflow provider, mainly handling version compatibility checks and metadata definitions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version via an import from the airflow package.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which is a standard control flow for version validation.",
  "flows": "The version string from airflow.__version__ is parsed and compared against a hardcoded minimum version, then an exception is raised if the version is incompatible.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated sections. It contains standard version checking logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version handling libraries, retrieves the installed airflow version, and compares it against a minimum required version. If the installed version is below 2.9.0, it raises an error to prevent incompatible usage. The code is auto-generated and includes licensing comments, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. It performs a typical version compatibility check with standard exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, legitimate version validation script with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It ensures compatibility for the package based on airflow version. No security risks or malicious behaviors are detected.",
