{
  "purpose": "A sensor operator for Apache Airflow that checks for the existence of a specific Cassandra table.",
  "sources": "The class constructor (__init__) reads parameters 'table' and 'cassandra_conn_id'. The 'poke' method reads the 'table' value and uses it to check the database via CassandraHook.",
  "sinks": "The 'hook.table_exists(self.table)' call potentially interacts with the database, but no untrusted data is written or executed directly in this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'table' and 'cassandra_conn_id' flow into the CassandraHook to check for table existence; no other data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. Use of the hook depends on external configuration; no suspicious dynamic code execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a sensor operator for Airflow that waits for a Cassandra table to exist. It accepts input parameters for the table name and connection ID, which are used in a database query via the CassandraHook. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The code relies on standard library imports, type hints, and Airflow hooks. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign Airflow sensor operator designed for database state checking. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The usage of parameters is straightforward and controlled by external configuration. Overall, the code is safe.",
