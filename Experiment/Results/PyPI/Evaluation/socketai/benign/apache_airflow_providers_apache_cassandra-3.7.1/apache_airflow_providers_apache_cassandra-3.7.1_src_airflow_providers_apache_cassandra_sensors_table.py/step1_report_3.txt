{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom Airflow sensor operator for checking the existence of a Cassandra table.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters such as 'table' and 'cassandra_conn_id', and during execution, it uses these to create a CassandraHook and call table_exists.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the method hook.table_exists(self.table), which queries the Cassandra database for table existence. It does not appear to send data externally or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'table' and 'cassandra_conn_id' flow into the CassandraHook instance, which then performs a database query to verify table existence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears standard for a sensor operator in Airflow, with proper use of type hints and class structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a class inheriting from BaseSensorOperator, and implements the 'poke' method to check for a table in Cassandra. It uses the provided connection ID and table name, logs an info message, and calls 'table_exists' on the hook. No suspicious or malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward, designed for a specific purpose within Airflow, and uses standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate and benign custom operator for monitoring Cassandra tables within an Airflow workflow. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
