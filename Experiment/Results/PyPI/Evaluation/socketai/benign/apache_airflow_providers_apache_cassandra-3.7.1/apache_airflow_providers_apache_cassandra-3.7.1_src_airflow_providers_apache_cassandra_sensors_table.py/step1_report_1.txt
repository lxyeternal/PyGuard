{
  "purpose": "The code defines an Airflow sensor operator to check the existence of a Cassandra table.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'table' parameter from the class instance and the 'cassandra_conn_id' parameter during initialization, and retrieves data through the hook in 'poke' method.",
  "sinks": "The 'table' and 'cassandra_conn_id' parameters are used to establish a database connection and perform the check, but do not directly lead to any data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('table', 'cassandra_conn_id') flow into the class constructor and are used in the 'poke' method to invoke 'table_exists' on the Cassandra hook.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The class is a straightforward implementation of an Airflow sensor.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a class to check for Cassandra table existence, with parameters for table name and connection ID. The 'poke' method logs an info message and calls 'table_exists' via the Cassandra hook. The use of standard library features and established Airflow hooks indicates normal behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, network communications beyond the intended database check, or other malicious activities. The code appears to be a legitimate part of an Airflow data pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an Airflow sensor operator for Cassandra. It performs a harmless check for table existence and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
