{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom Airflow sensor operator to check for the existence of a Cassandra table.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters such as 'table' and 'cassandra_conn_id', and calls 'hook.table_exists' to verify table existence.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; primarily calls external Cassandra hook to perform existence check.",
  "flows": "Uses 'table' and 'cassandra_conn_id' as sources; flows into 'hook.table_exists' method as a sink for the 'table' parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an Airflow sensor operator. It correctly uses dependency injection and leverages existing hooks for database interaction. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leakage. The logic is straightforward, focusing on checking table existence in Cassandra. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate component for an Airflow DAG with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It safely interacts with Cassandra to verify table presence without exposing sensitive information or executing harmful actions.",
