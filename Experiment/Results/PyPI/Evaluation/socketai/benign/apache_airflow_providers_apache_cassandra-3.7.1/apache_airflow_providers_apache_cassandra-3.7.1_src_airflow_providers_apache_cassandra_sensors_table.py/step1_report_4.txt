{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom Airflow sensor operator to check for the existence of a Cassandra table.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'table' and 'cassandra_conn_id'.",
  "sinks": "The 'poke' method calls 'hook.table_exists(self.table)', which queries Cassandra to check for table existence.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> 'poke' method -> 'CassandraHook.table_exists()' method call to Cassandra database.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; the connection ID is configurable; no obfuscated or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The class extends a base sensor operator and uses a Cassandra hook to check if a specific table exists in Cassandra. It takes 'table' and 'cassandra_conn_id' as parameters. The 'poke' method logs the check and calls 'table_exists'. No suspicious or malicious code behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious network activity are present. The code relies on established Airflow and Cassandra libraries, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate custom sensor for Cassandra within an Airflow workflow, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
