{
  "purpose": "Checks for the existence of a specified Cassandra table within an Airflow DAG, facilitating task dependencies based on database state.",
  "sources": "The 'table' parameter provided during initialization, used in the 'poke' method to query the Cassandra database via the CassandraHook.",
  "sinks": "The 'table_exists' method on the CassandraHook, which queries the Cassandra database; no data is leaked or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Input: 'table' parameter -> 'poke()' method -> 'CassandraHook.table_exists()' -> database response indicating existence or absence.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present. The code is straightforward and relies on standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard Airflow sensor operator that checks for a Cassandra table's existence. It uses established hooks and parameters, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws. The 'table' parameter is configurable, and the connection ID is managed externally. The 'poke' method simply calls 'table_exists' on the CassandraHook, which is a benign database query. No data leaks, network anomalies, or malicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign and straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of an Airflow Cassandra table existence sensor. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1). Overall, the code is benign and suitable for production use.",
