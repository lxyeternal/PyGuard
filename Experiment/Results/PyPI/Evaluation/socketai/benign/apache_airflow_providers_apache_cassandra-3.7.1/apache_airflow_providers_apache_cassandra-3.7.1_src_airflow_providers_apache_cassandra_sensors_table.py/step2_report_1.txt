  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of an Airflow sensor operator that checks for the existence of a Cassandra table.\n- It uses standard imports, proper class structure, and relies on established hooks.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The `table_exists` method is called on the Cassandra hook, which is a typical way to perform such checks.\n- The code does not perform any data leaks, malicious network activity, or code injection.\n- The parameters are configurable and passed through class initialization, with no signs of malicious manipulation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code.** It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured component for an Airflow DAG.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **None identified.** The code is clean, standard, and follows best practices.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk score:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.1 to 0.2). These are acceptable given the code's nature, but since the code itself is benign, a score of 0.0 could be justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No reason exists to assign a high risk score. The code is safe, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Correctly assigned as 0 in all reports, consistent with the code.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All reports correctly interpret the code without making unwarranted assumptions. They recognize the code's purpose and confirm its benign nature.\n\n### Score consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to zero)\n\n**Overall, the code is a safe, standard implementation of an Airflow Cassandra table existence sensor.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores assigned are appropriate given the code's benign nature.",
