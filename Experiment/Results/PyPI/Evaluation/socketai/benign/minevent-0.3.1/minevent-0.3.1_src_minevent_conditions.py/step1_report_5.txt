{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for event conditions and a concrete implementation of a periodic condition used to evaluate whether an event should trigger based on frequency.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, abc, typing, and the code itself (class definitions and methods). No external or untrusted input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "evaluate() method updates internal state (_step), but does not perform any I/O or data leaks. No external data sinks or malicious data handling present.",
  "flows": "The evaluate() method updates internal counter and returns a boolean based on modular arithmetic. No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. The code appears straightforward, implementing a simple frequency-based condition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class with required methods for conditions, and a concrete implementation for a periodic trigger. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; the code functions as a basic logical utility without external data handling or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of condition classes for event handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages internal state to evaluate periodic events.",
