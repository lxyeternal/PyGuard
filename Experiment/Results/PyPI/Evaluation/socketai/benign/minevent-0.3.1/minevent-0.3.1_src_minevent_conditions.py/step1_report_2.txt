  "purpose": "Define abstract base class for event conditions and a specific implementation of a periodic condition.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, abc, and typing modules, class initializations, and method calls within evaluate.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or output sinks detected; no external data handling or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Initialization of condition objects, calling evaluate repeatedly to trigger internal state changes, comparisons via equal method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution. Code appears standard for defining conditions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base class for event conditions and a periodic condition implementation, including typical class structure, properties, and methods. The evaluate method increments internal state and returns a boolean based on modular arithmetic, which is straightforward. No external data sources or sinks are involved. No unusual code patterns or potential backdoors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a standard framework for event condition evaluation without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for normal use in event handling logic.",
