  "purpose": "Defines a base class for event conditions and a specific implementation for periodic triggers, used in event handling systems.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; internal state '_step' and '_freq' used within 'evaluate()' method.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input: method calls to 'evaluate()' increment '_step'; output: boolean indicating trigger condition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class design; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple, well-structured condition class for event systems. It uses internal counters to trigger periodically, with no external dependencies or malicious code. All reports confirm benign intent, correct logic, and appropriate scoring. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for event condition evaluation. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious behavior, and is free of obfuscation. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the analysis.",
