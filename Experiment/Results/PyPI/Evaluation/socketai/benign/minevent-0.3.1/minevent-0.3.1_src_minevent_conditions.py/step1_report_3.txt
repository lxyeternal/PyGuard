{
  "purpose": "Define base and periodic conditions for an event system, used to evaluate whether certain conditions are met for event handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines classes and methods with internal state management.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations, no network or file operations, no untrusted data handling or external data sources.",
  "flows": "The flow involves internal state updates within the evaluate() method (incrementing _step) and comparisons for equality, with no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard with clear class definitions, abstract methods, and straightforward logic. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class for conditions and a concrete implementation of a periodic condition that evaluates based on internal counters. No external input handling, no network activity, or code injection points are present. The evaluate method increments an internal counter to determine periodic triggers, which is a normal pattern. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of condition classes with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It serves a benign purpose within an event system framework. Overall, the code appears safe and trustworthy.",
