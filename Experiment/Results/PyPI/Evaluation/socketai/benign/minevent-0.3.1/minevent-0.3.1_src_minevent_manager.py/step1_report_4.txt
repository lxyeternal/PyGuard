{
  "purpose": "Implement an event management system allowing adding, removing, triggering, and querying event handlers.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, class attributes, and imported modules. No external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data or perform dangerous system operations. No output sinks suggest malicious data leaks or system impacts.",
  "flows": "Event handlers are added and triggered via method calls; handlers are stored in internal data structures; no external data flows or network communications are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Usage of standard data structures and straightforward methods. No code injection, data leakage, or privacy violations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard event manager class with methods to add, remove, trigger, and reset event handlers. It uses safe data structures such as defaultdict and standard Python constructs. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The logging is standard, and the code does not access sensitive environment variables or perform unsafe operations. The overall design appears to be a conventional event management implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an event manager with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected functions securely and transparently.",
