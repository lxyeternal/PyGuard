  "purpose": "Implement an event management system allowing adding, triggering, checking, and removing event handlers for string-identified events.",
  "sources": "The code reads event names from input parameters such as 'event' and 'event_handler'. It also accesses internal data structures like '_event_handlers' and '_last_triggered_event'. No external data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that handle untrusted data for effects such as system calls, network, or file operations. The event handlers are invoked via their handle() method, which is external and could potentially be malicious if user-defined, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-provided event names and handlers into internal data structures. When triggering an event, the event name flows from input to setting '_last_triggered_event' and calling 'handle()' on each handler. No external system interactions or dangerous operations are performed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present. The code employs standard data structures and methods. No obfuscated code, misleading variable names, or dynamic code execution is observed. All class and method usages appear legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard event manager implementation with methods for adding, removing, checking, triggering, and resetting event handlers. It uses 'defaultdict' for storing handlers, which is a common pattern. The 'trigger_event' method updates '_last_triggered_event' and calls handlers' 'handle()' method. The 'has_event_handler' method compares handlers with an 'equal()' method, relying on the 'BaseEventHandler' class. The overall structure is straightforward, and no suspicious code constructs, data leaks, or malicious patterns are detected. It appears to be a benign utility class designed for event handling with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard event management utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It manages event handlers securely and performs no external malicious actions. All functions follow typical design patterns, and no anomalies suggest malicious intent. The handlers themselves are external and could potentially contain malicious code, but the code here is safe.",
