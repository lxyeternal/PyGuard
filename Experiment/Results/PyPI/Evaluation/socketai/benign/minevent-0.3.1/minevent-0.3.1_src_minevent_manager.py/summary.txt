  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured event manager with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The moderate risk score reflects the potential danger if handlers are malicious, which is outside the control of this code but inherent to event-driven architectures."
