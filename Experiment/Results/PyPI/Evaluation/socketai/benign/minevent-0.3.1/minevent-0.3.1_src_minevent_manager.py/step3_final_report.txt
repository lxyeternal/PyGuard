  "purpose": "A standard event manager class that allows adding, removing, triggering, and resetting event handlers, facilitating event-driven programming.",
  "sources": "Internal data structures such as _event_handlers and _last_triggered_event; no external data reads.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of the handle() method on event handlers; no external system calls or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Event names and handlers are stored internally; trigger_event calls handle() on handlers, which could execute arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical event management system. It maintains a mapping of events to handlers, allowing handlers to be added, removed, and invoked. The only external influence is via handler invocation, which could be malicious if handlers are malicious, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present. The risk is inherent in any plugin or callback system relying on external code, but the implementation itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured event manager with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The moderate risk score reflects the potential danger if handlers are malicious, which is outside the control of this code but inherent to event-driven architectures.",
