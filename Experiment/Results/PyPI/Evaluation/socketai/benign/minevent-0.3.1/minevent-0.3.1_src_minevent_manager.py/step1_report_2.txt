{
  "purpose": "Implement an event management system allowing adding, triggering, and removing event handlers for string-named events.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data when adding, removing, or triggering events and handlers, particularly in methods such as add_event_handler, remove_event_handler, trigger_event, and property last_triggered_event.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flows through event names and handlers, which could influence internal state or execution if misused. No external sinks like network or file I/O are directly present.",
  "flows": "Sources (event names and handlers) flow into event handler registration/removal and event triggering functions, affecting internal handler lists and the last_triggered_event variable; these flows are straightforward and do not involve external data or execution beyond handler invocation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are evident. The code primarily manages handler lists and logging; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. Logging uses debug level but no external or malicious side-effects are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard event management pattern using a dictionary of lists for event handlers, with methods to add, remove, trigger, and reset handlers. It relies on handler equality for management. There are no signs of malicious code such as network operations, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of an event system with proper handling and logging. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected, and the code structure follows expected patterns without anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign implementation of an event manager without any signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It appears to serve its purpose of managing event handlers securely and transparently.",
