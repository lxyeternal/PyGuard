  "purpose": "Defines a framework for event handlers, including base, simple, and conditional handlers, allowing execution of arbitrary callables with optional arguments and conditions.",
  "sources": "Handler functions and condition evaluations, supplied externally during handler instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of user-supplied callables within handle() methods, potentially executing malicious code if handlers are compromised.",
  "flows": "Handler invocation flows from handler callables through handle() methods, conditioned by evaluate() in conditional handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a typical event handler pattern with abstract base classes and concrete implementations, including conditional execution. Handlers execute arbitrary callables, which is inherent to such systems. No malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The primary security concern is executing untrusted handlers, which is expected in event-driven architectures. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.2) are consistent with this analysis. No evidence suggests malicious intent or behavior within the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured event handling framework with no malicious or suspicious elements. The main risk stems from executing external handlers, which is inherent and not malicious. The scores assigned are appropriate and align with the analysis.",
