  "purpose": "Define base classes and specific implementations for event handlers, including conditional execution based on a condition.",
  "sources": "User-defined functions and callables provided as handlers, environment variables are not used, no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "Execution of user-defined callables (handler functions), which could potentially perform malicious actions if the handler functions are malicious or compromised.",
  "flows": "Handlers are invoked through the handle() method, which calls the stored callable with provided arguments; conditional handlers evaluate a condition before invoking the handler.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors detected. The code structure is standard for event handler patterns. The only point of potential concern is that handlers are arbitrary callables, which could be malicious if supplied maliciously, but this is expected in such a pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an abstract base class for event handlers, with concrete implementations for simple handlers and conditional handlers. It uses type hints, standard design patterns, and well-structured methods. No external data sources, network activity, or file operations are present. The only significant risk stems from executing arbitrary user-provided callables, which is typical for event handler systems but should be used carefully in trusted contexts. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious modifications. The code does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of event handlers with no explicit malicious intent. The primary security concern is the execution of arbitrary callables, which is inherent to the pattern but not malicious per se. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident.",
