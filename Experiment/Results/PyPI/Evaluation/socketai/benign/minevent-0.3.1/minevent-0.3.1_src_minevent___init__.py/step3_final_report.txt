{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or API surface for the 'minevent' package, importing core classes and defining the public interface via __all__.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules ('minevent.conditions', 'minevent.handlers', 'minevent.manager')",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export pattern with no suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard package interface module that imports classes from internal modules and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, and no network or file operations. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious logic are present. The code's simplicity and structure are typical for a Python package's __init__.py or interface file, indicating benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a package interface with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
