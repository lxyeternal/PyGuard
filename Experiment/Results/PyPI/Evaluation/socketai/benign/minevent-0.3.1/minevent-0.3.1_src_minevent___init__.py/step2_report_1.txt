  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily a module initializer or interface, importing classes from internal modules and defining an `__all__` list for exports.\n- No untrusted data handling, dynamic code execution, network operations, or system modifications are observed.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n- The code is straightforward, standard for a Python package's `__init__.py` or module interface.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not process untrusted input, perform any system calls, or execute code dynamically.\n- The import statements are static and from internal modules, which are assumed to be part of the package.\n- The `__future__` import is benign, serving compatibility purposes.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0 across all entries, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of any suspicious behavior.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are uniformly positive, with high confidence (1) and no anomalies detected.\n- The code's simplicity and the absence of any suspicious patterns suggest that the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should indeed be 0.\n- The reasoning in the reports appears sound; they correctly identify this as benign package setup code.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should be 0.\n- The risk score should be 0, reflecting no security threat.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
