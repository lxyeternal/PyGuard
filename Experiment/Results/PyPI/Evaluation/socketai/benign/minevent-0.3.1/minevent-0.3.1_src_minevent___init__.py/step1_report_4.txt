{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an initialization or __init__.py file for the 'minevent' package, defining public API components for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'minevent.conditions', 'minevent.handlers', and 'minevent.manager' modules",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or file operations present",
  "flows": "Imports re-export core classes; no data flows or source-to-sink paths observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines the public API via __all__ and imports specific classes from internal modules. It does not process input data, execute dynamic code, or perform network/file operations. The imports are static and straightforward, serving to expose core classes for package users. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer for the 'minevent' package, acting as an API surface without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
