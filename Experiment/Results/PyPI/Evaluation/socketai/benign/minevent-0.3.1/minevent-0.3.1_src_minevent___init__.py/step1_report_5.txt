  "purpose": "Define and export core features of the 'minevent' package, including conditions, handlers, and an event manager.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'minevent' submodules, which load specific classes related to conditions, handlers, and event management.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily performs module exports and imports.",
  "flows": "Import statements load classes from 'minevent' submodules; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from internal 'minevent' submodules and defines an export list. There are no dynamic code executions, external data reads, or other suspicious behaviors. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file. No signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a straightforward module initializer for the 'minevent' package, with no malicious or security-threatening content identified.",
