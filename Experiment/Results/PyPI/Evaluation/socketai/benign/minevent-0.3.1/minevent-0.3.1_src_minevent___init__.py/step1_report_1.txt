  "purpose": "To define and export core components of the 'minevent' package for event handling and conditions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'minevent' modules and '__all__' list defining exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; code does not process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; purely import/export setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a module initializer, importing various classes from submodules and defining the symbols to export. It performs straightforward import and export functions with no evident malicious logic, data handling, or security risks. The code structure is clean and standard for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a package interface definition with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected. It appears to be a benign module setup for the 'minevent' package.",
