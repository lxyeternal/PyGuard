{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom reStructuredText directive for including hazard warning messages in documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own static strings and the content provided in the directive (self.content).",
  "sinks": "The code generates documentation nodes and does not write to external systems or handle untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Content from the directive input (self.content) flows into the message string, which is then incorporated into a documentation node.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious external calls, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules for documentation parsing, defines static warning messages, and creates a custom directive class that appends a hazard warning to documentation content. The directive uses static strings and user-provided content to generate admonition nodes. The setup function registers the directive and node handlers with the documentation app. There are no external data sources, no data leakage, and no malicious code execution patterns present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a custom documentation directive with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply adds hazard warnings in documentation. There are no indicators of malware, malicious data flow, or security vulnerabilities.",
