{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom reStructuredText directive called 'hazmat' that displays a hazardous warning message, primarily for documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the directive's content (self.content) and the 'self.lineno' attribute for line number information.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities or data leaks. The message content is generated from predefined strings and the directive's input, with no external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input from self.content is used to format an alternate message, then combined into a paragraph node for rendering. There are no external data flows or system calls involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is a straightforward implementation of a documentation directive with no malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom directive for documentation that displays a warning message. It uses standard docutils classes and methods, with no external dependencies beyond the standard library. The message content is static and formatted with optional content provided by the user. No data is fetched, transmitted, or processed insecurely. The code does not perform any network, file, or system modifications. It is purely for documentation enhancement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless documentation directive with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to display a warning message in documentation pages and does not contain any malicious or obfuscated code.",
