  "purpose": "Defines a custom reStructuredText directive ('hazmat') for documentation warnings, displaying a playful hazard message with optional content.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'docutils' modules and 'self.content' for user-supplied content.",
  "sinks": "Generates documentation nodes; no external data, system calls, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "User content is incorporated into the warning message for display only; no external or system flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code; playful warning message, but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx extension for documentation purposes, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It uses static strings and user input solely for documentation rendering, with no external interactions or code execution. The structure is straightforward, and no anomalies or obfuscation are present. The code's intent is benign, and it does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign documentation utility with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals and reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The malware score is 0, security risk is 0, obfuscated is 0, and confidence is 1, consistent with the analysis.",
