  "purpose": "Generate cryptographic HKDF vectors using a static input key material for testing or documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded IKM (hex string) within the script.",
  "sinks": "Writing the derived vectors and parameters to the file 'hkdf.txt'.",
  "flows": "Static IKM is input to HKDF derivation; output is formatted and written to a file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded IKM, which could be sensitive if misused, but typical for test vectors; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward HKDF derivation with a static input, formats the parameters and output, and writes to a file. No external input, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The static IKM is a potential concern in production but acceptable here for testing. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The cryptographic operations are standard and correctly implemented. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward cryptographic vector generator intended for testing or documentation. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The low risk score reflects the static IKM but is justified given the context. The code does not pose any security threat or malicious intent.",
