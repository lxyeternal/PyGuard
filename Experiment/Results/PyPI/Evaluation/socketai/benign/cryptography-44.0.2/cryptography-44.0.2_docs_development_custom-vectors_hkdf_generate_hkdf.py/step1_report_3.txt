  "purpose": "Generate HKDF key derivation vectors and save them to a file.",
  "sources": "Reads static input data (IKM) defined within the code; reads and writes files.",
  "sinks": "Writes the derived vectors to a file named 'hkdf.txt'.",
  "flows": "Static IKM -> HKDF derive() -> output vector string -> file write 'hkdf.txt'.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded cryptographic input (IKM), which is standard for test vectors but not inherently malicious. No external input or untrusted data involved. No obfuscation or unusual code constructs. No network activity, data leakage, or code injection present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward HKDF derivation using a hardcoded input (IKM) and SHA-256, then formats and writes the result to a file. The derivation is static and does not involve any user input or environment variables. The file operation is basic and safe. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. The use of cryptographic primitives appears legitimate and standard. No suspicious patterns or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple test vector generator for HKDF with static input. There is no malicious intent, no malicious behavior, and no security risks identified. The code appears to be for cryptographic testing or vector generation purposes only.",
