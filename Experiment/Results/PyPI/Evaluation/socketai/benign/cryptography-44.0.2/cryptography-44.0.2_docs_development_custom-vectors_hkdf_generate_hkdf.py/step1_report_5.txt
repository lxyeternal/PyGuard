  "purpose": "Generate HKDF-derived key material and output the parameters and result to a text file.",
  "sources": "Input data: hardcoded IKM (initial key material).",
  "sinks": "Writing output to 'hkdf.txt' file.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded IKM -> HKDF derive() -> OKM -> _build_vectors() -> _write_file() -> File 'hkdf.txt'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets other than IKM; no obfuscation or suspicious data manipulation; no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code derives a key using HKDF with a hardcoded initial key material (IKM) and writes the parameters and derived key to a file. The IKM is static, but there is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or backdoors. The use of standard cryptographic primitives is appropriate. No user input, no suspicious file operations, no network activity, and no obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs legitimate key derivation and file output operations with no malicious intent. It appears to be a benign cryptographic utility intended for key material generation or testing.",
