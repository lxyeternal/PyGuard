  "purpose": "Generate and save HKDF key derivation vectors to a text file for testing or documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads hardcoded binary input data (IKM); reads filename parameter for writing output",
  "sinks": "Writes output data to a file named 'hkdf.txt'",
  "flows": "IKM (hardcoded) -> HKDF derivation -> formatted output -> file write",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded IKM; no user input or external data sources; straightforward cryptographic operation; no suspicious or unusual code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a fixed binary input (IKM), performs HKDF derivation using SHA-256, and outputs the parameters and derived key to a text file. The IKM is hardcoded, which could be a concern if secret key material was expected to be dynamic or confidential, but here it appears to be static for testing or documentation. No dynamic input, environment variables, or external data sources are used. The file is written to disk with a fixed filename, with no evident malicious intent. The cryptographic operations are standard and correctly implemented. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This script generates HKDF vectors with static input data and writes them to a file. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks beyond the presence of hardcoded key material, which may be appropriate depending on context. There are no signs of malware or malicious code.",
