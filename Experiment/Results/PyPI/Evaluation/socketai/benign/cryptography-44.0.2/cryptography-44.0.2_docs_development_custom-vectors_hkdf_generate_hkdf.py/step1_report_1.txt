  "purpose": "Generate HKDF key derivation vectors and write them to a text file for testing or documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads hardcoded input key material (IKM) from a hex string; reads filename parameter from function argument.",
  "sinks": "Writes output vector data to a file named 'hkdf.txt'.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded IKM -> HKDF derivation -> formatted output -> file write operation.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded IKM, which could be sensitive in some contexts; no dynamic or external input sources. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports cryptography primitives, defines a static IKM, derives a key using HKDF, and saves the generated vectors to a file. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. The hardcoded IKM might be sensitive if used improperly but appears to be for testing or documentation purposes. No malicious behavior or suspicious activity observed. The code is straightforward, with clear intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script generates key derivation vectors and writes them to a file without any malicious intent. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or harmful actions. No signs of malware or malicious behavior detected.",
