{
  "purpose": "Generate HKDF key derivation vectors and save them to a file named 'hkdf.txt'.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded IKM (Input Key Material) and derives OKM (Output Key Material); it also reads no external input or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to a file 'hkdf.txt' using a fixed filename; no untrusted data is written to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded IKM -> HKDF derive() -> OKM -> _build_vectors() -> _write_file() -> 'hkdf.txt'.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded IKM value; no dynamic or external inputs; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward HKDF key derivation with a hardcoded input. It constructs a vector description and writes it to a file. No user input, environment variables, or network communications are involved. The use of cryptography appears standard and benign. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose is to generate and save cryptographic vectors for testing or documentation. There is no malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risk observed.",
