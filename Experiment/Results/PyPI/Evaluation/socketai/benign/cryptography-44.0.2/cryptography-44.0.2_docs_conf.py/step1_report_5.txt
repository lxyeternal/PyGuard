  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building project documentation using Sphinx, including theme, extensions, and output options.",
  "sources": "Reading the LICENSE file, reading __about__.py for version info, importing sphinx modules, reading external configuration and license files.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reading version info from __about__.py; importing and configuring extensions; setting up documentation parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Use of try-except for optional imports is standard. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or network operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file. It imports necessary modules, sets up extensions and themes, reads project metadata, and configures output formats. All imports are standard, and there are no signs of dynamic code execution, network communication, or data handling that could indicate malicious intent. The try-except blocks for optional modules are benign and common. The file reads version information from a local file, which is standard practice. No anomalies such as embedded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration script for documentation generation using Sphinx. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no security risks. The code appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
