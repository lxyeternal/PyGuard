  "purpose": "Generate and process ECDSA signature vectors for testing or cryptographic validation based on FIPS 186-3 vectors.",
  "sources": "load_vectors_from_file function reading the FIPS vector file; os.path.join constructing file paths; load_vectors_from_file parsing the vector file.",
  "sinks": "Writing output to a file via open_vector_file context manager; print statements outputting signature data.",
  "flows": "load_vectors_from_file reads input data -> build_vectors generates cryptographic signatures -> write_file outputs signature details to file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of secure cryptographic library (ecdsa) with key generation and signing; no suspicious hardcoded credentials; no unusual data handling. No evidence of code that retrieves untrusted external input or executes untrusted code. No hidden or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads cryptographic test vectors from a file, generates new ECDSA key pairs, signs messages with these keys, and outputs signature components along with message data. It uses standard cryptographic libraries securely, with no evidence of malicious data handling or backdoors. The process appears to be for cryptographic validation or testing rather than malicious activity. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs cryptographic vector generation and signing using well-known libraries and standard procedures. It appears intended for testing or validation purposes, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The code is secure, straightforward, and does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious characteristics.",
