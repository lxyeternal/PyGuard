{
  "purpose": "Generate ECDSA signature vectors for testing purposes using known vectors and cryptographic functions.",
  "sources": "Reads cryptographic vector data from a file using load_vectors_from_file; loads vectors from file; generates cryptographic keys and signatures internally.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to a file via write_file function; prints signature information and key details to standard output and a file.",
  "flows": "Reads input vectors -> generates key pairs -> signs messages -> outputs signature data and key info to file and stdout.",
  "anomalies": "Uses secure cryptographic libraries appropriately; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no unusual or suspicious data flows observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads cryptographic test vectors, then generates new ECDSA key pairs and signatures for each message, outputting relevant data. It employs secure cryptographic libraries (ecdsa, cryptography) and standard hashing functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels. The output is intended for testing or validation purposes, not malicious activity. No obfuscated code or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate cryptographic utility for generating ECDSA signature vectors for testing or validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It securely uses cryptographic libraries and outputs data in a controlled manner.",
