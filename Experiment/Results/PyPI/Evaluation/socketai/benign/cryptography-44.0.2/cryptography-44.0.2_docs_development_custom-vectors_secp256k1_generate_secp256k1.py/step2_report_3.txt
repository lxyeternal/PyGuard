  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Loads cryptographic vectors from a file.\n- For each message, generates a new ECDSA key pair.\n- Signs the message using the generated key.\n- Outputs signature components and message info.\n- Uses standard cryptographic libraries (`ecdsa`, `hashlib`, `cryptography_vectors`).\n- No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- Appears intended for testing or vector generation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Observations:\n\n**Code correctness:**\n- The code appears syntactically correct.\n- Uses standard cryptographic functions and libraries.\n- Implements vector-based signing as expected.\n- No evidence of code that would cause errors or malfunction.\n\n**Malware & malicious activity:**\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No network activity.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious code.\n- The only potential concern is the repeated generation of new keys per message, but this is standard in testing contexts, not malicious.\n\n**Security risks:**\n- The code performs cryptographic signing, but all keys are generated dynamically.\n- No private keys are stored or transmitted insecurely.\n- The output is formatted data, not secret or sensitive information.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Finds the code legitimate.\n- Confident at 0.9.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- No issues; reasoning sound.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also finds the code legitimate.\n- Same confidence.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Reasoning consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar assessment.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion.\n- No malware.\n- Malware score: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same analysis.\n- No malware.\n- Malware score: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or inconsistencies:\n- All reports agree on the benign nature.\n- The only slight concern is the purpose: generating test vectors with new keys each time—this is standard for testing, not malicious.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Metric             | Score (0-1) | Justification                                                                                 |\n|--------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0           | No malicious activity, no backdoors, no network activity, no suspicious code.             |\n| Obfuscated         | 0           | Clear, straightforward code, no obfuscation detected.                                      |\n| Risk (overall)     | 0.1 - 0.2   | Very low; mainly for testing purposes, no security risk in normal operation.             |\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, standard cryptographic testing code)\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n- The code is standard cryptographic vector generation for testing.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- The scoring by the reports is consistent with my analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign cryptographic test code. The scores assigned are appropriate, and I would keep the malware and obfuscation scores at zero, with a very low security risk score.\n\n**Overall recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware score at 0.\n- Keep obfuscated at 0.\n- Security risk score around 0.1–0.2, reflecting its testing purpose but no inherent security issues.\n\n**Final overall scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2",
