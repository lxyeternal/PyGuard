  "purpose": "Generate cryptographic test vectors by loading existing vectors, creating new ECDSA key pairs, signing messages, and outputting signature components and key details.",
  "sources": "Reading vector data from files, generating new private keys, and signing messages with dynamically created keys.",
  "sinks": "Outputting signature components, key details, and message info; no untrusted data flows into insecure sinks.",
  "flows": "Load vectors -> generate keys -> sign messages -> output signature and key info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard cryptographic operations.",
  "analysis": "The code loads cryptographic vectors, generates new ECDSA key pairs for each message, signs the messages, and outputs detailed signature components and key info. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The private keys are generated dynamically and not stored insecurely. The output is for testing or vector validation purposes. No network activity or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, testing-oriented nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cryptographic test vector generator with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify its purpose and assign appropriate low risk scores. No evidence suggests malicious behavior or obfuscation. The overall assessment confirms the benign and standard cryptographic utility nature of the code.",
