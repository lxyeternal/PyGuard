  "purpose": "A utility function to resolve the URL of a Python object's source code location in the cryptography GitHub repository, used for documentation or debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Importing modules via importlib, accessing sys.modules, inspecting objects with inspect, and reading cryptography module info.",
  "sinks": "Constructs a URL string based on source file path and line numbers; no untrusted data is used in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "Import module -> retrieve object -> get source file and lines -> build URL with version info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; exception handling is broad but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard introspection to locate source files and line numbers for Python objects, then constructs a URL pointing to the corresponding source in the cryptography GitHub repo. It relies solely on trusted libraries and module metadata, with no external input influencing its behavior. Exception handling is broad but typical for such introspection functions. The code is adapted from numpy's linkcode resolver, a common pattern in documentation tooling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-understood utility for linking source code locations, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate. To be more precise, the overall security risk could be set to 0, but 0.1 remains acceptable given the minimal risk involved.",
