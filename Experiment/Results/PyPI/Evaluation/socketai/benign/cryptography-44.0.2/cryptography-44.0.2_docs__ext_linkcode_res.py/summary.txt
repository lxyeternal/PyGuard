  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-understood utility for linking source code locations, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate. To be more precise, the overall security risk could be set to 0, but 0.1 remains acceptable given the minimal risk involved."
