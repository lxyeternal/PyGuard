{
  "purpose": "This code resolves URLs for Python objects, primarily for linking to source code in a repository.",
  "sources": "The module imports libraries (importlib, inspect, os, sys), and reads data from module attributes and functions such as module names, object attributes, and cryptography version info.",
  "sinks": "Uses inspect functions to get source file paths and source lines, and constructs URLs for source code references.",
  "flows": "Imports module -> Retrieves module object -> Accesses object attributes -> Gets source file and lines -> Constructs URL with version info",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. Uses standard library functions for introspection. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Python introspection to resolve URLs to source code locations on GitHub. It handles exceptions gracefully, avoids executing untrusted code, and only reads source and module info. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious actions are present. It relies on trusted libraries and standard practices for source code referencing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for source linking, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It’s well-structured, with proper exception handling and no suspicious behavior.",
