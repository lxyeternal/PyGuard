{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to resolve the URL of a Python object’s source code on GitHub, primarily used for linking documentation to source code locations.",
  "sources": "Reading module information, object attributes, source file paths, and source lines via importlib, sys.modules, inspect, and os.",
  "sinks": "None of the sinks directly lead to data leaks or malicious actions; the code mainly retrieves source file information and constructs URLs.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> loads a module -> retrieves an object -> unwraps decorators -> gets source file and lines -> constructs URL based on version.",
  "anomalies": "Code is heavily commented and adapted from external sources (NumPy). No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily resolves source code URLs for Python objects by importing modules, inspecting object attributes, unwrapping decorators, and fetching source file locations. It uses standard Python inspection libraries without any suspicious or malicious operations. The version check for 'dev' or stable releases influences URL formatting but does not introduce security risks. The code is straightforward and uses common techniques for documentation linking.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical utility for linking source code to online repositories, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is well-commented, sourced from reputable external code, and employs standard library functions without unusual or suspicious patterns.",
