{
  "purpose": "The code generates RSA key pairs and creates OAEP-encrypted test vectors for cryptographic testing, saving the output to text files.",
  "sources": "The code reads input vectors from external files via load_vectors_from_file, and accesses environment variables indirectly through the os.path.join function.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output data to files using write_file, which could potentially be exploited if filenames are manipulated, but filenames are statically constructed in this context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input vectors into RSA key generation and encryption/decryption routines, ultimately outputting formatted cryptographic parameters and encrypted messages to files.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs RSA key generation during runtime, which is standard in testing environments but could be misused if embedded in malicious payloads. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No suspicious or obfuscated code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads cryptographic test vectors, generates RSA keys dynamically, and performs RSA encryption/decryption operations with OAEP padding across different hash algorithms. It constructs and saves detailed key parameters and encrypted data. The key operations involve cryptography library functions with standard parameters and no unusual or suspicious logic. No input/output streams interact with untrusted sources beyond reading test vectors, and output is written to predefined filenames. No signs of data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors are observed. The overall structure appears consistent with cryptographic testing code, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate cryptographic testing utility used to generate and verify RSA OAEP vectors across multiple hash algorithms. There are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage, and no suspicious anomalies were detected.",
