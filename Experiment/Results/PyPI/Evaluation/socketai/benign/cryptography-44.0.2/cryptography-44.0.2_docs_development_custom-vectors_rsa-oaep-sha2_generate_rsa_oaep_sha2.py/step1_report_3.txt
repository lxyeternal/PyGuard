  "purpose": "Generate RSA OAEP encryption vectors for testing cryptographic implementations using different hash algorithms.",
  "sources": "load_vectors_from_file() function (loads test vectors), private key parameters, environment variables (not explicitly used here).",
  "sinks": "File writing via write_file() function, encrypting/decrypting messages with RSA and OAEP padding.",
  "flows": "Load test vectors -> Generate RSA keys -> Decrypt test messages -> Encrypt messages with specified algorithms -> Write results to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; the code generates cryptographic keys dynamically. No unusual code patterns or obfuscation detected. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs cryptographic key generation, loads test vectors, decrypts messages, and re-encrypts using specified hash algorithms for OAEP padding. It writes output vectors to files. All cryptographic operations are standard, with no suspicious data handling or external communications. The process appears intended for testing and vector generation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a cryptographic test vector generator for RSA OAEP schemes. It generates RSA keys, decrypts test vectors, re-encrypts with different hash algorithms, and saves the results. No malicious intent, suspicious activities, or security risks are detected.",
