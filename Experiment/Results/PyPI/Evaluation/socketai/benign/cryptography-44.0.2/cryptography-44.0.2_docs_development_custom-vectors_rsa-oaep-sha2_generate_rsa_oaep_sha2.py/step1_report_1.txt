  "purpose": "The code generates RSA key vectors and performs encryption/decryption operations for cryptographic testing, specifically related to OAEP padding schemes with various hash algorithms.",
  "sources": "Loads test vectors from files using 'load_vectors_from_file' and 'load_pkcs1_vectors'; reads private key components from the loaded vectors.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'rsa.generate_private_key' for key creation, encrypts messages with 'pkey.encrypt', and decrypts with 'private_key.decrypt'. Writes output data to files via 'write_file'.",
  "flows": "Loads vectors -> generates RSA keys -> decrypts test messages -> encrypts messages -> writes vectors to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected. The code handles cryptographic key material and performs cryptographic operations as intended. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports cryptography libraries to generate RSA keys and perform encryption/decryption using OAEP padding with various hash algorithms. It processes test vectors, dynamically generates RSA keys (2048-bit), and constructs vector data with key parameters. The operations involve reading test vectors, decrypting messages, then re-encrypting them with different OAEP hash combinations, and outputting the results to text files. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The code appears to be part of a cryptographic test suite. The only potential concern is the use of dynamically generated keys and file output, which is standard for testing but could be misused if misinterpreted. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a cryptographic testing utility designed for generating and processing RSA test vectors. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It performs standard cryptographic operations without suspicious or malicious code, representing legitimate testing code rather than malware.",
