  "purpose": "Generate RSA OAEP test vectors with various hash algorithms, involving key generation, encryption, decryption, and file output for cryptographic validation.",
  "sources": "Loading vectors from files, generating RSA private keys, decrypting messages with private keys, encrypting messages with public keys, reading input data, writing output files.",
  "sinks": "Writing generated vector data to files, outputting formatted RSA key components and encrypted messages.",
  "flows": "Load vectors -> Generate RSA keys -> Decrypt test messages -> Encrypt with different OAEP parameters -> Save results to files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Use of dynamic key generation and file output is standard for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic test vector generation involving RSA key creation, decryption of known vectors, re-encryption with various hash algorithms, and output to files. No network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code is straightforward, with clear purpose, and uses well-established cryptography libraries. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident. The use of assertions for message validation is typical in test environments. Overall, the code aligns with legitimate cryptographic testing utilities, and no malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign cryptographic test vector generator with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with its purpose, warranting a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2). It is safe for use in cryptographic validation contexts.",
