{
  "purpose": "The code generates RSA key pairs and creates test vectors for OAEP encryption using various hash algorithms, primarily for cryptographic testing and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Loads test vectors from files via load_vectors_from_file, reads key parameters from loaded vectors, and reads files from the filesystem (oaep-vect.txt).",
  "sinks": "Writes output data (test vectors with encrypted messages) to text files using write_file.",
  "flows": "Loads cryptographic test vectors -> generates RSA keys -> decrypts provided ciphertexts -> re-encrypts with different hash algorithms -> writes test vectors to files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious actions. Use of cryptography libraries appears standard and benign. No hidden network connections or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads pre-existing cryptographic vectors, generates RSA key pairs, and performs encryption/decryption operations using standard cryptography library functions. The process involves creating test data for cryptographic algorithms, which is typical in security testing. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. File operations are limited to reading test vectors and writing output files. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution present. The code’s structure and purpose are consistent with cryptographic test vector generation, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cryptographic test vector generator with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs cryptography-related operations for testing purposes without any suspicious activity.",
