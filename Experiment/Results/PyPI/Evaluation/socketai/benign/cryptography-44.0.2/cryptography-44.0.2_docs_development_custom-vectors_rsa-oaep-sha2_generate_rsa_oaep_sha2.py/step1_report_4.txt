  "purpose": "The code generates RSA encryption vectors using OAEP padding with various hash algorithms for testing cryptographic implementations.",
  "sources": "Reads cryptographic vectors from external files (load_vectors_from_file, load_pkcs1_vectors), generates RSA private keys, and loads hash algorithms.",
  "sinks": "Uses RSA key generation, encryption, and decryption functions; writes output to text files.",
  "flows": "Loads vectors -> generates RSA keys -> decrypts provided ciphertexts -> encrypts messages with different hash configs -> writes results to files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The code performs standard cryptographic testing routines. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no unusual variables.",
  "analysis": "The script loads cryptographic test vectors, generates RSA keys for each test case, and performs encryption/decryption using OAEP padding with various hash functions. It writes the resulting vectors to files for testing purposes. The process involves standard cryptographic procedures without any suspicious or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, and no malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. It appears to be a legitimate testing utility for cryptography validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a cryptography test vector generator, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard key generation, encryption, and decryption processes for testing purposes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are detected.",
