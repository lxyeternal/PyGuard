  "purpose": "Automation scripts for testing, building, documentation, and coverage analysis in a Python project, including Rust coverage processing.",
  "sources": "Configuration files (pyproject.toml), environment variables, command-line arguments, filesystem (glob, uuid), external command outputs.",
  "sinks": "External commands invoked via session.run (pytest, sphinx-build, cargo, rustc, etc.), file writes for coverage reports, glob for Rust coverage files.",
  "flows": "Data from files, environment, and user input influence command execution and file handling; no untrusted code execution or data leaks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; standard use of UUIDs and globbing for temporary files and coverage data.",
  "analysis": "The code orchestrates build, test, and documentation workflows using controlled external commands. No malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of UUIDs and globbing is routine. External commands are invoked with controlled parameters, and no untrusted data is executed dynamically. The coverage processing is a standard routine for Rust projects. Overall, the code is a legitimate automation script with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured build and test automation script with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting routine external command execution in a controlled environment.",
