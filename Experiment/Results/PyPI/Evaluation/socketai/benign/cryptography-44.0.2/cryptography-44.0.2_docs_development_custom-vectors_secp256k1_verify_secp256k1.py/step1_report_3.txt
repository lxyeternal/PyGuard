{
  "purpose": "The code verifies ECDSA signatures using the SECP256K1 curve with test vectors loaded from a file.",
  "sources": "Reads test vector data from a file 'asymmetric/ECDSA/SECP256K1/SigGen.txt' via 'load_vectors_from_file' and 'load_fips_ecdsa_signing_vectors' functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptography library's public key verification methods, which process message and signature data for validation.",
  "flows": "Loads vectors from file -> processes each vector to reconstruct public key and signature -> verifies signature using cryptography library functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Uses standard cryptography functions for signature verification. No obfuscation, code injection, or data leakage apparent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs signature verification using well-established cryptography practices. It loads test vectors from a file, reconstructs public keys, and verifies signatures. The cryptography functions used are standard and do not involve any malicious code or suspicious behavior. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code's purpose appears solely to verify cryptographic signatures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cryptographic signature verification routine with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on test vectors and cryptography library functions in a typical manner.",
