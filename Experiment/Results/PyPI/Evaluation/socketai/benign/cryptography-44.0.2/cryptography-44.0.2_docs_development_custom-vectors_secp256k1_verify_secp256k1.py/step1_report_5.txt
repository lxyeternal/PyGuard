  "purpose": "The code verifies ECDSA signatures using test vectors loaded from a file, specifically for the SECP256K1 curve.",
  "sources": "File I/O via load_vectors_from_file, which reads cryptographic test vectors from a specified file path.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code primarily performs cryptographic verification without outputting or transmitting data externally.",
  "flows": "File loading (source) -> parsing test vectors -> cryptographic verification (sink) with loaded data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of test vector files and cryptographic verification functions; no anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports cryptographic libraries and loads test vectors for ECDSA signature verification. It constructs public keys from provided coordinates and verifies signatures against messages. File path is constructed using os.path.join, referencing a relative directory. No user input handling or network activity is present. The code strictly performs cryptographic verification without performing any suspicious actions or data leaks. The load_vectors_from_file function may process external data, but it is a standard testing practice and does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform standard cryptographic signature verification using test vectors, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical implementation for testing or validating cryptographic functions.",
