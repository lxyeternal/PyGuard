  "purpose": "The code verifies ECDSA signatures using the secp256k1 elliptic curve and cryptographic hashes.",
  "sources": "Reads cryptographic vector data from a file at 'asymmetric/ECDSA/SECP256K1/SigGen.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptographic verification functions; no direct sink for untrusted input to sensitive operations beyond standard verification.",
  "flows": "Loads signature vectors from file -> processes each vector to verify signatures using cryptography library functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. Uses standard cryptographic library functions without dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code loads cryptographic test vectors from a file and verifies signatures using the cryptography library's ECDSA functions on the secp256k1 curve. The vector data includes message and signature parameters, which are used securely within the verification process. No untrusted data flows into unsafe operations beyond standard cryptographic verification, which is safe if the data source is trusted or validated. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are evident. The code's structure is clear and employs standard cryptographic practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs cryptographic signature verification using well-known libraries and standard practices. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility for cryptographic testing or validation.",
