  "purpose": "The code verifies ECDSA signatures using the secp256k1 curve with vectors loaded from a file.",
  "sources": "Reading the vector file 'SigGen.txt' via 'load_vectors_from_file' and 'os.path.join'; uses external functions 'load_fips_ecdsa_signing_vectors' and 'load_vectors_from_file'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; verification results are not exposed externally; no network or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Vectors loaded from file -> parsed -> used to verify signatures -> verification process completes without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; usage of cryptography libraries appears standard; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic signature verification using the cryptography library, with no evident malicious intent. It loads verification vectors from a file, processes them through well-defined cryptographic functions, and performs verification without any side effects or malicious actions. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or backdoors are present. The functions and external libraries used are common in cryptographic implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of ECDSA signature verification using public vectors. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
