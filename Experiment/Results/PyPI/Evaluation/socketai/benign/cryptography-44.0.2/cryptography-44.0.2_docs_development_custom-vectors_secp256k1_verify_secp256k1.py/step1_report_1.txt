{
  "purpose": "The code verifies ECDSA signatures using vectors loaded from a file for cryptographic validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads cryptographic vector data from a file located at 'asymmetric/ECDSA/SECP256K1/SigGen.txt' through the load_vectors_from_file function.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptography library functions to process cryptographic signatures; no external data output or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Loads cryptographic vectors from file -> Processes each vector in verify_vectors -> Verifies signature with cryptography functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code relies on external vector files for input, which is standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code securely performs cryptographic signature verification using established libraries. It reads data from a specified file, loads vectors, and verifies each signature with proper cryptography functions. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage are present. The use of cryptography primitives appears standard and appropriate. There are no hidden network communications, no hardcoded credentials, and no obfuscated code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard cryptographic verification utility without malicious intent. It safely loads vectors, verifies signatures, and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behaviors. It is suitable for cryptographic testing purposes.",
