  "purpose": "Cryptographic verification of ECDSA signatures on the secp256k1 curve using test vectors loaded from a file.",
  "sources": "Reading test vectors from 'asymmetric/ECDSA/SECP256K1/SigGen.txt' via load_vectors_from_file and load_fips_ecdsa_signing_vectors functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only processes loaded data for cryptographic verification without external output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Load vectors -> reconstruct public keys -> encode signatures -> verify signatures; no external data flows or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward cryptographic verification code, no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic signature verification using cryptography library functions. It loads test vectors, reconstructs public keys from coordinates, encodes signatures, and verifies them. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The use of the verifier() method is deprecated but does not introduce security issues. The code relies on external test vector files, which is typical in cryptographic testing. The overall structure and purpose are benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with a utility for cryptographic validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign cryptographic signature verification utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and appropriate given its purpose and implementation.",
