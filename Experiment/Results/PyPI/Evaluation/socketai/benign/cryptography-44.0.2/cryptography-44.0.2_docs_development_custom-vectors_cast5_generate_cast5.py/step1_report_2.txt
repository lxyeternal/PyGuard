{
  "purpose": "The code processes cryptographic test vector files, extracts keys, IVs, and plaintexts, performs encryption using CAST5, and writes the resulting ciphertexts to output files.",
  "sources": "Reads input files containing keys, IVs, and plaintexts; reads data from specified vector files in the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Writes encrypted ciphertexts to output files; writes processed data to disk.",
  "flows": "Reads key, IV, plaintext from files -> performs encryption -> writes ciphertext to output files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Uses standard cryptography library functions. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads cryptographic vectors from files, unhexlifies data, and uses the cryptography library to perform encryption with CAST5 in various modes. It processes multiple files, builds vectors, and writes the results. All cryptographic operations utilize standard library functions, and no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. The code's purpose is to generate ciphertexts for testing or validation. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cryptographic test vector processor with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It securely uses cryptography library functions and only reads/writes local files for processing test vectors. No security risks or malware signals detected.",
