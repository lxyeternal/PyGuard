  "purpose": "Cryptographic vector generation and testing using CAST5 cipher in various modes, reading parameters from files and outputting encrypted vectors.",
  "sources": "Reading 'KEY', 'IV', and 'PLAINTEXT' lines from input files; unhexlifying these values.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted ciphertexts generated by encrypt() function, written to output files.",
  "flows": "Input lines (KEY, IV, PLAINTEXT) -> unhexlify -> encrypt() -> hexlify -> output files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. IV slicing to 16 characters is a minor implementation detail but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic vector processing with proper use of the cryptography library. It reads parameters from files, unhexlifies them, encrypts with CAST5 in various modes, and writes results. No network activity, environment variable usage, or malicious behavior is present. The only potential concern is lack of input validation, but this is typical for vector generation tools. The code is straightforward, with clear variable names and logic. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are detected. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate, reflecting the benign nature of the code. Minor risk scores account for untrusted file input but do not indicate security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign cryptographic vector generator with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are consistent with its behavior. No modifications are necessary; it is safe and straightforward.",
