  "purpose": "The code is designed to read cryptographic vector data from files, perform encryption using the CAST5 cipher in various modes, and generate output files with ciphertexts.",
  "sources": "File reads for vector data (build_vectors function), reading vector files specified by filenames.",
  "sinks": "Writing output data to files (write_file function), encryption output via encrypt function.",
  "flows": "Read vector data from files -> parse and extract keys, IVs, plaintexts -> perform encryption -> save ciphertexts to output files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no suspicious code behavior. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code reads cryptographic vectors from specified files, processes each line to extract keys, IVs, and plaintexts, then encrypts data using the CAST5 cipher in various modes. The encryption function properly unhexlifies inputs, sets up cipher objects, and produces ciphertexts. The vector-building function accumulates the encrypted results and writes them to output files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or backdoors. All operations appear standard for cryptographic testing or vector generation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign utility for generating ciphertext vectors using CAST5 in different modes. It performs file I/O, data parsing, and cryptographic operations without any suspicious or malicious activity. No security risks or malware signals detected.",
