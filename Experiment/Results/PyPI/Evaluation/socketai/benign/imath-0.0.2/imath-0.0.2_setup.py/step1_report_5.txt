  "purpose": "Configure the setup process for the 'imath' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, importing setuptools, and reading package configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no network or sensitive data handling is present.",
  "flows": "Reading long_description from file, then passing package configuration parameters to setuptools.setup() without further data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code behavior. The package_dir points to 'pkg', which is a normal directory specification.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, utilizing setuptools. It reads the README file for long description and sets package metadata. The package directory is specified as 'pkg', and packages are found in that directory. No code injection, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is present. No external data, network activity, or secrets are involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical and benign setup script for Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
