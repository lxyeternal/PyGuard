  "purpose": "Configure and set up the Python package 'imath' for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code primarily reads a file and configures package setup.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' -> Uses its content in setup() for long_description.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with no hardcoded secrets, suspicious URLs, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, reads a README file, and calls setup() with package metadata, including name, version, author info, description, and package discovery. The package directory is set to 'pkg', which is unconventional but not suspicious. No untrusted input handling or network activity is present. The code is typical for Python package setup and contains no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares the package metadata and configuration.",
