  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'imath' using setuptools, configuring metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description; uses hardcoded URL string; reads package code from 'pkg' directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity; no code execution; no secrets or credentials embedded.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> Configures package metadata -> Finds packages in 'pkg' directory.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an f-string for a static URL; unconventional 'package_dir' pointing to 'pkg' but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor issues are the unnecessary f-string and the unconventional package directory, which do not pose security risks. No external inputs or network activity are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign package configuration with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The scores and assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
