{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'imath' Python package, configuring package metadata and distribution details.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; no external input or untrusted data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or insecure operations; no sensitive data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script simply reads a file and configures packaging.",
  "anomalies": "Standard use of setuptools; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. Package directory 'pkg' appears unconventional but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading a README file, defining package metadata, and configuring package discovery with setuptools. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The 'package_dir' points to a non-standard directory 'pkg', which is acceptable but warrants confirmation that the directory exists and contains intended code. No code injection, external connections, or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no anomalies indicating malicious behavior.",
