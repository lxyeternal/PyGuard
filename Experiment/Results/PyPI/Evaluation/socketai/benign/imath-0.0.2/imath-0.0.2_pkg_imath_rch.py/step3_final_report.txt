  "purpose": "Utility functions for mathematical calculations: fraction, relative change, and distribution ratio.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (numerator, denominator, x1, x2, xlist).",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through calculations; no external data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "Incorrect NaN comparison in relative_change; debug print statement in dist_ratio; incomplete rate function.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic mathematical utilities with exception handling and logging. No external data sources or malicious code are present. The NaN comparison in relative_change is flawed; print statement in dist_ratio is a debugging artifact; rate function is unimplemented. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward, with minor development artifacts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for mathematical utility purposes, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. Minor issues are typical during development and do not pose security risks.",
