{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for mathematical calculations such as fraction, relative change, and distribution ratio calculations.",
  "sources": "The functions take input parameters from external calls, such as numerator, denominator, x1, x2, and xlist, which are provided by the caller.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that directly send data externally or perform unsafe operations. No network, file, or system command execution is present.",
  "flows": "Input data (numerator, denominator, x1, x2, xlist) flows through calculations, with no external or insecure data handling or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "The 'rate' function is defined but not implemented, which might indicate incomplete development. The use of print() for debugging in 'dist_ratio' could be considered a minor anomaly, but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward mathematical utility functions with proper error handling via try-except blocks. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors is observed. The functions are designed for safe calculations, with appropriate handling of division by zero. The incomplete 'rate' function appears to be a placeholder rather than malicious code. The use of print() is typical for debugging during development and does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code seems benign and intended for computational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of mathematical utility functions without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No malware indicators are present. The functions are standard, and there are no signs of sabotage or malicious features.",
