{
  "purpose": "The code provides mathematical utility functions for calculating fractions, relative changes, and distribution ratios.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters (numerator, denominator, x1, x2, xlist). No external data sources or user inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Data processing occurs internally; there are no evident sinks like network calls, file writes, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed within functions to produce outputs; no untrusted data flow to external systems is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'rate' is incomplete (empty implementation). The 'print' statement in 'dist_ratio' could leak data to logs, but this is standard debugging practice. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The use of 'logger.exception' indicates error handling but no malicious intent. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements basic mathematical functions with exception handling. 'fraction' safely handles division by zero, returning infinities or zero as appropriate. 'relative_change' calculates percentage change, checking for NaN values but using incorrect NaN comparison (x != np.nan is invalid in Python). 'rate' is defined but not implemented, which is a code oversight but not malicious. 'dist_ratio' computes ratios and logs internally; it is standard statistical processing. No external data sources, network operations, or secret management is involved. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard mathematical utility module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It contains minor implementation oversights (e.g., incomplete 'rate' function, NaN comparison), but these are benign. Overall security risk is very low.",
