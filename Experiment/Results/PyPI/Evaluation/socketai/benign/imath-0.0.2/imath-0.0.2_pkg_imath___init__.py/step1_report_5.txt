{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions from the 'imath.rch' module, likely for mathematical or statistical computations.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading functions from 'imath.rch' module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous operations identified",
  "flows": "No data flows, transformations, or untrusted data handling observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports functions from a third-party module 'imath.rch' without any further code or logic. There are no suspicious operations, data manipulations, or embedded code. Since only an import statement is present, it appears to be a standard dependency inclusion with no malicious intent or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a normal import statement for mathematical functions.",
