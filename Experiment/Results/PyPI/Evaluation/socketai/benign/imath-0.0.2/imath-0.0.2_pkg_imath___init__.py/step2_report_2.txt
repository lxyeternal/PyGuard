  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward import statement with no further logic.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Fully benign. Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, only import statements with no usage.\n- **Findings:** No data flow, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Safe. Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, only import statements, no further code.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Import of a non-standard module 'imath.rch', which warrants some caution.\n- **Findings:** The module is not part of standard libraries; potential concern if the module is malicious. However, in this snippet, only import statements are present, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1.  \n**Discussion:** Given the non-standard module, a small security risk score (0.1) is justified, but no malware or obfuscation detected. The confidence level is lower (0.6), which is appropriate due to the unfamiliar module.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar benign import statement.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports are about simple import statements with no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The only potential concern is the use of a non-standard module 'imath.rch' in Report 4, which warrants a small security risk score but no malware suspicion.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The malware scores should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores are correctly 0.\n- The security risk score in Report 4 (0.1) is justified due to the non-standard module, but it should not be higher unless further suspicious activity is observed.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate, considering the limited code snippets.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0 for Reports 1-3 and 5; 0.1 for Report 4, justified by the non-standard module.\n\n**Overall, the code snippets are benign import statements with no malicious intent.**",
