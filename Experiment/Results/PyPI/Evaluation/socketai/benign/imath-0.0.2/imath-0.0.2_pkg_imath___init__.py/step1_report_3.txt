  "purpose": "Import specific functions from the 'imath.rch' module, likely for mathematical or statistical computations.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'imath.rch' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with only import statements; no source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statement without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports four functions: fraction, relative_change, rate, and dist_ratio from a module named 'imath.rch'. There is no additional code or logic present that could indicate malicious intent. The module name appears to be a custom or third-party library focused on mathematical functions. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement importing functions from a module, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign based on the provided snippet.",
