  "purpose": "Importing specific mathematical functions from the 'imath.rch' module, likely for mathematical or analytical computations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'imath.rch' module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data outputs, network connections, or system modifications shown.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to the imported functions, which are not invoked or used in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet is minimal, with no usage of the imported functions, no configuration, no hardcoded secrets, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports functions from a module; there are no execution statements, no data inputs, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior. Since the code is incomplete and only contains an import statement, it does not demonstrate any malicious activity or security risks in its current form.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears to be a benign import statement with no malicious behavior. It provides no evidence of malware or security risks. Due to the limited scope, the confidence level is high that this is safe.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
