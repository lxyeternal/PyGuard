  "purpose": "Normalize the scheme part of a URL by converting it to lowercase.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'scheme' to the function normalize_scheme.",
  "sinks": "Return statement that outputs the normalized scheme.",
  "flows": "Input 'scheme' is processed by scheme.lower() and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations, defines a default scheme, and provides a straightforward function to lowercase a URL scheme. The function is simple and appears to serve a basic normalization purpose without any side effects or external data dependencies. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic are detected. The code does not perform any network operations, data leakage, or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for URL scheme normalization with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
