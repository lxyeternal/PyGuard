  "sinks": "Return statement output of the normalized scheme.",
  "flows": "Input 'scheme' -> normalization (lowercasing) -> output return",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it defines a function to convert the URL scheme string to lowercase, which is a common normalization step. There are no external data sources, no use of environment variables, and no unsafe operations. The only operation is string lowercasing, which is safe and standard. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple normalization task without any malicious intent or security risks.",
