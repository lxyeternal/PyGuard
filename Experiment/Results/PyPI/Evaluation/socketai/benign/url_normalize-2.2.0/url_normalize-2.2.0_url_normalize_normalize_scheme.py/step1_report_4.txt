  "sinks": "Return statement that outputs the normalized scheme string.",
  "flows": "Input 'scheme' -> 'scheme.lower()' -> output return.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports annotations, defines a constant for default scheme, and provides a simple function that converts a given URL scheme string to lowercase. There are no external data sources, no unsafe data handling, no suspicious side effects, and no malicious behavior. The function is well-defined and secure for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic normalization task without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is clean, simple, and safe.",
