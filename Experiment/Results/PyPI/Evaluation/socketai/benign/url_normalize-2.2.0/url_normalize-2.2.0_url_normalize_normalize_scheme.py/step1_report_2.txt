  "purpose": "Normalize the URL scheme to lowercase.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'scheme' in the function normalize_scheme.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing normalized scheme; no data leaks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Input 'scheme' → normalize_scheme() → output normalized scheme.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply converts the provided URL scheme string to lowercase, which is a standard normalization procedure. It imports __future__ annotations for type hints, defines a default scheme, and contains a single function that normalizes the scheme string. There are no data flows involving untrusted external sources other than the input parameter. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code performs a straightforward string operation without side effects or external communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing basic URL scheme normalization without any malicious intent or security risks.",
