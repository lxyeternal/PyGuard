  "purpose": "Normalize the scheme part of a URL by converting it to lowercase.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'scheme' to the function 'normalize_scheme'.",
  "sinks": "The 'scheme.lower()' call, which transforms the input string.",
  "flows": "Input 'scheme' is received, then transformed to lowercase and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with no hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a simple utility to normalize URL schemes by converting the input string to lowercase. It imports a future annotation feature for compatibility, defines a constant for 'https', and contains a single function with clear docstrings. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, no external data sources, no untrusted input handling beyond the 'scheme' parameter, and no code that interacts with the network, filesystem, or environment variables.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign operation to normalize URL schemes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks, serving a basic utility purpose.",
