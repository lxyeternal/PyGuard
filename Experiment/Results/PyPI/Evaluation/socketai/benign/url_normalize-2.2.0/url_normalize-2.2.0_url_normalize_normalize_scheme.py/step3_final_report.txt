  "purpose": "Normalize the scheme part of a URL by converting it to lowercase.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'scheme' in the function normalize_scheme.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing the normalized scheme string.",
  "flows": "Input 'scheme' -> normalize_scheme() -> return lowercased scheme.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward string lowercasing with no external data or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility function that lowercases a URL scheme string. It imports annotations for type hints, defines a default scheme constant, and provides a function that normalizes the scheme by converting it to lowercase. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The function performs a benign, common operation. The code is clear, with no external dependencies or data handling, and no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for URL scheme normalization with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its simplicity and safety. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are appropriate and should remain at 0. The confidence level is high, given the straightforward nature of the code.",
