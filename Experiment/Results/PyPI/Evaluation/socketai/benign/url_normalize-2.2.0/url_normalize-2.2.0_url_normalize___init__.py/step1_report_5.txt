  "sinks": "No sinks such as data transmission, system modification, or sensitive data access are present.",
  "flows": "The code only re-exports 'url_normalize'; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The license information and version are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module initializer with minimal logic. It imports a function and sets module metadata, with no input/output or executable code that could be malicious. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a straightforward module interface for URL normalization. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
