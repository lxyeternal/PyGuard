  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the corresponding reports carefully.\n\n**Code Overview:**\nThe code is a minimal module that:\n- Declares metadata (__license__, __version__, __all__)\n- Imports a function `url_normalize` from a local module `.url_normalize`\n- Exposes `url_normalize` via `__all__`\n\n**Security Assessment:**\n- The code itself is straightforward, with no data processing, input handling, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated elements.\n- No suspicious patterns or anomalies.\n- The import path is a relative import, typical for package modules.\n- The module functions as a simple interface to an external normalization function.\n\n**Review of the Reports:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n- No suspicious behaviors, anomalies, or potential vulnerabilities are detected.\n- The reasoning is sound; the code is purely a re-export module with no internal logic that could introduce security issues.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- The only external dependency is `url_normalize`, which is imported but not visible here. Its security depends on its implementation, but this code does not interact with it in a way that could cause harm.\n- No assumptions are made about the external module; the code's simplicity minimizes risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate; the code is benign.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet poses no security threat based on the provided information.",
