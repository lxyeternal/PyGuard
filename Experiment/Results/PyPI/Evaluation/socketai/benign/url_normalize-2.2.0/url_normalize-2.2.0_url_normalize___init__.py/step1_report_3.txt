{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to serve as an entry point or interface for URI normalization by exposing the 'url_normalize' function from a module.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .url_normalize import url_normalize' which loads a function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks in this code; it only imports and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code appears to be straightforward module packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code includes only a module-level docstring, license and version info, and an import statement. It exposes a function 'url_normalize' from a local module, likely used elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures. The import path indicates a relative import, typical for package modules, with no external or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module wrapper exposing a URI normalization function. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks identified in this snippet.",
