  "purpose": "A minimal module that re-exports the 'url_normalize' function from a local module, serving as an interface.",
  "sources": "Import of 'url_normalize' from a relative module '.url_normalize'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Import statement imports 'url_normalize'; no data flow involving untrusted input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; straightforward structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package module that defines metadata and re-exports a function from a local module. It contains no data processing, input handling, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The security of the overall package depends on the implementation of 'url_normalize', but this snippet itself is benign. The import is standard for package modules, and no suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
