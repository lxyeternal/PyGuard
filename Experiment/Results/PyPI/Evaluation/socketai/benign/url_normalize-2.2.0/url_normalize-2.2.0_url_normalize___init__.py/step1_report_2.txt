{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for URI normalization by importing a function from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata from its own module, such as __license__, __version__, and __all__, and imports url_normalize from a local file.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points for untrusted data or user input within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only imports a function and sets module-level variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module initialization script, declaring licensing, version, and exporting a normalization function. There are no operations involving external data input, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated elements. It appears to be a straightforward package module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely exposes a URL normalization function from a local module.",
