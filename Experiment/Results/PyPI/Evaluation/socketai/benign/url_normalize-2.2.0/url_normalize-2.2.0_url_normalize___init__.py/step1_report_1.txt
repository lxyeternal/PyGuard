{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple module that re-exports a URL normalization function, likely for use in a larger project to standardize URLs.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'url_normalize' from a relative module '.url_normalize'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data processing points involving untrusted input; no data leaks or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The flow would be from external code calling 'url_normalize' after importing this module; no internal processing is visible.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors, such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines metadata (license, version) and re-exports a function from a local module. There are no inputs, outputs, or processing logic that could introduce security issues. The imported module 'url_normalize' is external to this snippet; its security cannot be assessed here, but this code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, harmless re-export module for URL normalization. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this snippet.",
