{
  "purpose": "URL path normalization, including percent-encoding, dot-segment removal, and default path assignment for specific schemes.",
  "sources": "Input URL path string, scheme parameter, and functions 'quote' and 'unquote' from the local 'tools' module.",
  "sinks": "The function processes the input data internally; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input path is unquoted, percent-encoded, split into segments, dot-segments removed, and then rejoined; default path assigned if necessary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; reliance on external 'tools' functions assumes benign implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URL normalization: it encodes characters, removes '.' and '..' segments, and assigns default paths for certain schemes. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure operations are evident. The logic is straightforward and adheres to URL normalization standards. The external 'quote' and 'unquote' functions are presumed safe; no network or file operations are performed. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Overall, the implementation is clean, correct, and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL path normalization function with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and minimal security risk (0) are appropriate. The reports' assessments are consistent with the code's behavior.",
