{
  "purpose": "The code normalizes URL paths by removing default path segments and percent-encoding certain characters to produce a standardized URL path component.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'path' (URL path string), 'scheme' (URL scheme string). Functions called: quote(), unquote() from the tools module.",
  "sinks": "Potential data processing within quote() and unquote(); final returned 'path' which may be used in URL handling or network requests.",
  "flows": "Input 'path' -> unquote() -> quote() -> process segments ('.', '..') -> join() -> output 'path'. Input 'scheme' influences whether normalization rules are applied.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior observed. Use of quote/unquote functions depends on external module but appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly normalizes URL paths by decoding, re-encoding, and removing redundant or default segments, following standard URL normalization practices. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or unauthorized data exfiltration. The functions invoked are common in URL handling and are assumed to be safe. No suspicious code flow, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present. The code adheres to expected URL normalization procedures, with no apparent security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This module performs standard URL path normalization without malicious intent. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It is safe for use, assuming 'quote' and 'unquote' are from trusted, standard libraries.",
