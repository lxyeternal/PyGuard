{
  "purpose": "The code normalizes URL path components by percent-encoding certain characters and removing dot-segments to standardize URL paths.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'path' and 'scheme'. The 'path' is processed through 'unquote' and 'quote' functions, which handle URL encoding/decoding.",
  "sinks": "The 'path' variable after processing is returned; the encoding functions and string manipulations are the primary data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input 'path' is unquoted, then percent-encoded, split into segments, and reconstructed. The scheme influences how dot-segments are handled, affecting the output path.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code constructs. Usage of string operations and external functions ('quote', 'unquote') are standard. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs URL path normalization by decoding, selectively re-encoding, and resolving dot-segments based on the scheme. The functions 'quote' and 'unquote' are imported from a tools module, assumed standard for URL encoding. The logic for handling special schemes and path segments is typical for URL normalization. No suspicious code behaviors, no hidden network activity, or data leaks are evident. The functions appear to be safe and purposeful for URL processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL normalization routine with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely handles URL path segments and encoding according to common practices.",
