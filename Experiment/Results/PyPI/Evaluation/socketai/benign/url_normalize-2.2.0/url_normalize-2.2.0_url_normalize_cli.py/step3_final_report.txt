  "purpose": "CLI utility for URL normalization using the url_normalize function.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (url, charset, default_scheme, default_domain, param_allowlist, filter_params).",
  "sinks": "Outputting normalized URL or error messages to stdout/stderr.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> parse args -> call url_normalize with parameters -> output result or error.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; param_allowlist split without validation, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around url_normalize, handling arguments, exceptions, and output. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure behavior detected. The only minor concern is unvalidated splitting of param_allowlist, which is not inherently risky. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No external network activity or data leaks are present. The implementation relies on the safety of url_normalize, which appears standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, legitimate utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent.",
