  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious Code or Obfuscation:**  \nAll five reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard CLI wrapper around the `url_normalize` function, with no suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n\n**2. Parameter Handling and Validation:**  \nThe only minor concern is that `param_allowlist` is split into a list without validation, but this is typical and not inherently dangerous. No evidence suggests this could be exploited for injection or other attacks.\n\n**3. Error Handling:**  \nException handling is standard: catches all exceptions, prints an error message, and exits with code 1. No leaks or mishandling of sensitive data.\n\n**4. External Behavior and Data Flows:**  \nThe script only reads input from the command line, calls an internal URL normalization function, and outputs the result. No network activity, data leaks, or external side effects are present.\n\n**5. Scores and Justification:**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code. I agree with this.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.1, which is very low. Given the code's nature, this seems reasonable.\n\n**6. Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**  \nThe only assumption is that `url_normalize` is safe and does not introduce vulnerabilities. Since it's an imported function, its security depends on its implementation, but from the context, it appears to be a well-understood utility.\n\n**7. Final Estimation:**  \nBased on the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a safe, standard CLI wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, inherent to any code that processes user input, but nothing dangerous here)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a legitimate, safe utility for URL normalization with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should remain as they are.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1",
