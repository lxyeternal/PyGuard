  "purpose": "Command line interface for normalizing URLs, providing options for URL processing and filtering.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, especially URL input, parameter allowlist, and other URL normalization options.",
  "sinks": "Uses the url_normalize function to process data; output is printed to stdout or stderr.",
  "flows": "Input URL and options -> url_normalize function -> normalized URL output or error message.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles command-line arguments, calls an external URL normalization function, and outputs results. Argument parsing includes user inputs such as URL, charset, default scheme, domain, filtering options, and allowlist. The allowlist is derived from a comma-separated string, with no evident security issues. Exception handling is straightforward, printing errors to stderr. No untrusted data flows outside the URL normalization process, and no suspicious or malicious code behaviors are present. The code relies on external libraries for URL processing and does not include any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper for URL normalization with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not handle sensitive data insecurely or perform any suspicious actions. Overall, it appears safe and intended for legitimate URL processing tasks.",
