  "purpose": "Command line interface for URL normalization, allowing users to process and standardize URLs with optional parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads input URL and optional parameters from command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses the url_normalize function with provided parameters; output is printed to stdout or stderr.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> parameter parsing -> url_normalize function -> output or error message.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; parameter handling appears standard. The param_allowlist is split without validation, but this is typical. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments to customize URL normalization. It uses standard libraries and a function imported from an internal module. The param_allowlist string is split into a list if provided; no validation or sanitization occurs here, but it is not inherently malicious. Error handling simply prints error messages. No data leaks, external network connections, or suspicious behavior are present. No code injection, backdoors, or malware indicators are detected. The code structure is clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions as a safe, straightforward CLI wrapper for URL normalization. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate utility code.",
