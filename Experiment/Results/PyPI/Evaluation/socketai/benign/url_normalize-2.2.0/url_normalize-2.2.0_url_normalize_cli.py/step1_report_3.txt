  "purpose": "Command line interface for URL normalization using the url_normalize module.",
  "sources": "Input URL via command line argument; optional parameters from command line arguments (charset, default scheme, default domain, filter params, param allowlist).",
  "sinks": "Output normalized URL to stdout; error messages to stderr.",
  "flows": "User provides URL and options -> arguments parsed -> param_allowlist processed -> url_normalize called with arguments -> result printed or error message printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. Parameter processing appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily functions as a CLI wrapper around the url_normalize function, parsing user input and passing parameters accordingly. It handles exceptions gracefully, printing errors if normalization fails. No untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks such as network or file operations; output is to stdout/stderr only. The code does not perform any malicious actions itself. It also does not contain any obfuscated or malicious code snippets. The parameters and flow are typical for a URL normalization utility, with no signs of malicious intent or covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI interface for URL normalization, with no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and focused on its intended purpose.",
