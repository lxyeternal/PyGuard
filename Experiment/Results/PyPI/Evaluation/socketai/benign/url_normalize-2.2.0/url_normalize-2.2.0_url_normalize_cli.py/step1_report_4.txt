  "purpose": "Command line interface for normalizing URLs using the url_normalize library.",
  "sources": "Input URL from command line argument, optional parameters from command line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Printing normalized URL to stdout, printing error messages to stderr.",
  "flows": "User input URL and parameters -> url_normalize function -> output or error message.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code present. The code handles user input safely and cleanly.",
  "analysis": "The script processes user input via argparse, which includes URL and optional parameters. It splits param_allowlist if provided, which is a straightforward operation. It calls url_normalize with user-supplied parameters, with exception handling that outputs errors. No dangerous code injection, data leakage, or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper with proper exception handling and no suspicious behavior or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper for URL normalization with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely processes input, calls a normalization function, and outputs results or errors accordingly. No malware or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
