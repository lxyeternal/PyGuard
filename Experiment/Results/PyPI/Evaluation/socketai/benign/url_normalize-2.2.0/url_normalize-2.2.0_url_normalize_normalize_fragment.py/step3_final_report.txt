  "purpose": "Normalize URL fragment by decoding percent-encodings and re-encoding with safe characters (~=).",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'fragment' (URL fragment string), functions 'unquote' and 'quote' from '.tools'.",
  "sinks": "The 'quote' function outputs the normalized URL fragment; no external sinks or data leaks involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'fragment' -> unquote() -> quote() with safe='~=' -> output normalized fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward URL normalization, no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URL fragment normalization by decoding then re-encoding with specific safe characters (~=). It relies on imported functions 'quote' and 'unquote', assumed to be standard URL encoding/decoding functions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The process aligns with RFC 3986, and the code is simple, well-documented, and free of anomalies. The external functions are presumed safe; no data leaks or dynamic code execution are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard URL normalization utility with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the analysis.",
