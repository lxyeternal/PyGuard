{
  "purpose": "The code normalizes URL fragments by percent-encoding certain characters based on RFC 3986 rules, specifically allowing '~' and '=' as safe characters.",
  "sources": "The input source is the parameter 'fragment' provided to the 'normalize_fragment' function.",
  "sinks": "The function calls 'quote' with the processed 'fragment', which performs percent-encoding, potentially affecting URL safety but not directly leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input 'fragment' → 'unquote' (decode any percent-encodings) → 'quote' (re-encode with specified safe characters).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The code performs standard URL normalization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions for URL quoting and unquoting, defines a function to normalize URL fragments according to RFC 3986, and specifies safe characters. It performs a decode-then-encode cycle, ensuring certain characters are preserved. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; the logic is straightforward URL normalization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard URL fragment normalization utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates within expected parameters without harmful side effects.",
