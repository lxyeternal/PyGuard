{
  "purpose": "To normalize the fragment part of a URL according to RFC 3986 standards, ensuring safe characters are preserved during encoding.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'fragment', which is a string representing the URL fragment provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "The 'unquote' function call potentially removes percent-encoding, and 'quote' re-encodes the fragment; these are standard URL encoding/decoding functions and do not inherently lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Input 'fragment' -> unquote() to decode any existing percent-encoding -> quote() to re-encode with safe characters (~=) preserved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard URL encoding functions without any obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. No dynamic execution or external data sources involved.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations and two functions 'quote' and 'unquote' from a local module. It defines a function 'normalize_fragment' that decodes the fragment string and then re-encodes it, allowing certain safe characters. This is a straightforward URL normalization process following RFC 3986. The process does not involve any user input beyond the provided parameter, does not execute external commands, and uses only well-understood URL encoding functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL normalization function without malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It correctly handles safe characters as per RFC 3986, with no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
