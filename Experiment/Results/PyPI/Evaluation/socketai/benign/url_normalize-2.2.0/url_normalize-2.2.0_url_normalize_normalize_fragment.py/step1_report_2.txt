  "purpose": "Normalize URL fragment parts according to RFC 3986 by unquoting and re-quoting with specific safe characters.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'fragment' received by the function 'normalize_fragment'.",
  "sinks": "The 'quote' and 'unquote' functions from the '.tools' module, which process the fragment string.",
  "flows": "Input 'fragment' -> unquote() -> quote() -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present. The code is straightforward, with clear normalization logic. The reliance on external 'quote' and 'unquote' functions could be scrutinized, but they are imported from a presumably benign module.",
  "analysis": "The function unquotes the input string and then re-encodes it, preserving certain safe characters. The logic aligns with URL normalization practices and does not involve dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious operations. The only external dependencies are 'quote' and 'unquote', which are typical URL processing functions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard URL fragment normalization without any malicious intent or security issues. It simply applies unquoting and quoting with a defined set of safe characters, adhering to RFC 3986 guidelines.",
