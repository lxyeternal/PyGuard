  "purpose": "Normalize URL fragments according to RFC 3986, ensuring safe characters are preserved during URL encoding.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'fragment', which is a string representing the URL fragment.",
  "sinks": "The 'quote' and 'unquote' functions from the '.tools' module, which handle encoding and decoding of URL components.",
  "flows": "Input 'fragment' is unquoted (decoded), then re-quoted with safe characters '~=' to produce the normalized fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. Usage of safe characters is explicitly documented and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code properly documents the normalization process for URL fragments, utilizing standard URL encoding/decoding functions. It only manipulates string data through these functions, without executing any dynamic code, network activity, or insecure operations. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors. Usage of the 'quote' and 'unquote' functions appears standard and safe, assuming they are well-implemented in '.tools'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL normalization function with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It adheres to RFC 3986 and safely handles URL fragment characters. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
