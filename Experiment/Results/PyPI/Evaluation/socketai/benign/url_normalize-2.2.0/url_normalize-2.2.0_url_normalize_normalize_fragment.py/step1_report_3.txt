{
  "purpose": "The code normalizes URL fragments by unquoting and then requoting them with specific safe characters, primarily to ensure consistent and safe URL fragment formatting.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'fragment' which is a string representing the URL fragment to be normalized.",
  "sinks": "The functions 'unquote' and 'quote' imported from '.tools' are used as sinks, which process the 'fragment' data for URL encoding/decoding.",
  "flows": "Input 'fragment' -> unquote (removes percent-encoding) -> quote (re-encodes with safe characters '~=').",
  "anomalies": "The code itself is straightforward and does not contain any unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The function performs URL normalization by unquoting a fragment, then re-quoting it with specific safe characters. The use of the quote and unquote functions is standard for URL encoding processes. No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present. The code aligns with RFC 3986 URL standards and maintains a clear, well-documented purpose. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code patterns. The only notable aspect is its focus on URL normalization, which is a common security practice to prevent URL-based injection or malformed URL issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for URL fragment normalization with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and solely intended for URL processing.",
