  "purpose": "Normalize the host part of a URL by converting to lowercase, removing trailing dots, and handling international domain names using IDNA encoding.",
  "sources": "User-provided host string input.",
  "sinks": "Encoding and decoding functions, particularly idna.encode, idna.decode, and string manipulation methods.",
  "flows": "Host input -> force_unicode (sanitizes input) -> lowercase and strip -> split into parts -> idna.encode (per label) -> decode back -> join parts -> return normalized host.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Use of exception handling for IDNA processing appears standard. No suspicious network activity or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing necessary modules and defining a default charset. The function normalize_host takes a host string, converts it to unicode, lowers case, strips trailing dots, then splits into labels. It processes each label with idna.encode to handle internationalized domain names, with fallback to direct encoding if an IDNAError occurs. The process is standard for host normalization. No indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unsafe code. Use of exception handling here is typical for robustness rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard host normalization with IDNA handling. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The implementation appears safe and intended for URL processing.",
