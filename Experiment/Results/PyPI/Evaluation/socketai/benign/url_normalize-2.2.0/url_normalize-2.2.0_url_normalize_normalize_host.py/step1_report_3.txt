  "purpose": "Normalize the host part of a URL by lowercasing, stripping trailing dots, and handling internationalized domain names (IDN) using IDNA2008 standards.",
  "sources": "The host input parameter to the normalize_host function.",
  "sinks": "The encode/decode operations involving IDNA encoding and decoding, which could potentially be misused if input is maliciously crafted for encoding traps.",
  "flows": "Host input -> force_unicode -> lower -> strip('.') -> split into parts -> idna.encode (per label) -> decode -> join -> return",
  "anomalies": "Use of idna.encode with uts46=True and transitional=True; fallback to encode/decode in case of IDNAError; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns. No external data or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to normalize a URL host component, including handling internationalized domain names with proper Unicode processing. It uses standard libraries and functions with appropriate error handling. The only potential concern is the use of idna.encode and decode, but these are standard procedures for IDN processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. The code does not perform any network operations, file system access, or secret handling. It is a straightforward normalization routine with robust error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs URL host normalization with proper Unicode handling and error fallback. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility function for URL processing.",
