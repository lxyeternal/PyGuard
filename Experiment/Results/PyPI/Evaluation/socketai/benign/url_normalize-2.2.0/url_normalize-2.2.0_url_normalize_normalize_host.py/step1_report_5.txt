{
  "purpose": "Normalize the host part of URLs by converting to lowercase, removing trailing dots, and processing internationalized domain names (IDN).",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'host' and 'charset'; 'force_unicode' function imported from '.tools'.",
  "sinks": "Encoding and decoding operations on 'host' and 'parts'; use of 'idna.encode' and 'decode'.",
  "flows": "Input 'host' -> 'force_unicode' -> lowercase and strip -> split into parts -> process each part with 'idna.encode' -> join and return.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard normalization procedures with IDNA handling. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URL host normalization, including case lowering, trailing dot removal, and IDNA processing for internationalized domain names. It handles IDNA errors gracefully with a fallback. The functions and modules used are common and do not contain obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward URL host normalization utility without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It properly handles IDNA encoding and decoding, with fallback mechanisms in case of errors. No security risks or malware are evident.",
