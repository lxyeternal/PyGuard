{
  "purpose": "Normalize the host part of URLs by lowercasing, removing trailing dots, and handling internationalized domain names using IDNA2008 with UTS46 transitional processing.",
  "sources": "Input host string; internal processing of host labels with idna.encode",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; processing is confined to string manipulation and encoding/decoding",
  "flows": "Input host -> force_unicode -> lowercase and strip -> split into labels -> encode each label with idna.encode -> decode back -> return normalized host",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; fallback on IDNAError is standard; no obfuscation or malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URL host normalization, including Unicode handling, IDNA encoding with transitional processing, and error fallback. It uses common libraries and practices without external network calls or secret handling. The fallback mechanism is typical and does not introduce vulnerabilities. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2). The code is straightforward, well-structured, and secure for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe URL host normalization routine with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores are consistent and justified.",
