  "purpose": "Normalize the host part of a URL, handling case, trailing dots, and international domain names (IDN).",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'host' in the function 'normalize_host'.",
  "sinks": "Encoding and decoding operations, specifically 'idna.encode', 'decode', and 'host.encode'.",
  "flows": "Input 'host' -> 'force_unicode' -> 'lower' -> 'strip' -> split into parts -> IDNA processing with 'idna.encode' -> decoding -> join and return.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'force_unicode' function, which may obscure data origin; the fallback to direct encoding in case of IDNAError may encode untrusted data, but this is standard for domain normalization. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs host normalization by lowercasing, stripping trailing dots, and handling IDN via 'idna' library. The process involves encoding each label with 'idna.encode' to ensure proper internationalization handling, then decoding back. The fallback to direct encoding is a typical practice. No data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The use of 'force_unicode' might obscure data origin, but it appears to be a standard utility function. Overall, the code appears to perform expected normalization without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code securely normalizes URL hosts, properly handles IDN with no evident malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
