  "purpose": "URL port normalization by removing default port numbers for known schemes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'port' and 'scheme' in the function 'normalize_port'.",
  "sinks": "Return value of 'normalize_port', which outputs normalized port strings.",
  "flows": "Input 'port' and 'scheme' are validated and processed; if 'port' matches default, an empty string is returned; otherwise, the normalized port is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple, well-defined task: removing default ports from URLs. It checks if 'port' is numeric, converts it to an integer to normalize (removing leading zeros), then compares it to the default port for the given scheme. If they match, it returns an empty string; otherwise, it returns the normalized port. No external dependencies, network activity, or malicious behavior are present. The logic is clear, and the code is free from obfuscation or vulnerabilities. All signals indicate benign utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign URL normalization utility with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The previous reports' assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's characteristics. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
