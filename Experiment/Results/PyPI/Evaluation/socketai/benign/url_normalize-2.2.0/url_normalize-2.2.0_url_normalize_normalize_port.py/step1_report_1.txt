{
  "purpose": "The code aims to normalize the port component of a URL by removing default port numbers for specific schemes.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'port' and 'scheme' parameters provided to 'normalize_port'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the code processes input parameters and returns a string.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('port' and 'scheme') are validated and processed to determine if the port matches default ports for the scheme, then returns either the port or an empty string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious behaviors, or unusual code patterns detected. The function performs straightforward normalization logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a mapping of default ports for various URL schemes. The 'normalize_port' function validates that 'port' is numeric, converts it to an integer and back to a string, then compares it with the default port for the given scheme. If they match, it returns an empty string; otherwise, it returns the original port. The logic is simple, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or data leakage. The function serves a standard URL normalization purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for URL port normalization with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs basic data validation and normalization without external dependencies or risky operations.",
