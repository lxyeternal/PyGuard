  "purpose": "Normalize the port part of a URL by removing default port numbers for specific schemes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'port' and 'scheme' to the function 'normalize_port'.",
  "sinks": "Return value of the function 'normalize_port'. No external or untrusted data flow detected.",
  "flows": "Input 'port' and 'scheme' are processed; if conditions match, an empty string is returned; otherwise, the port is returned as a string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a mapping of default ports for various URL schemes. The 'normalize_port' function verifies if the 'port' is numeric, converts it to an integer to strip any leading zeros, and compares it with the default port for the given scheme. If they match, it returns an empty string, indicating normalization; otherwise, it returns the port as a string. The implementation is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The code appears to serve a utility purpose related to URL normalization without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign URL normalization utility function with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. It performs straightforward validation and normalization of URL ports based on predefined defaults.",
