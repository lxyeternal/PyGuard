{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to normalize the port component of a URL by removing default port numbers for known schemes.",
  "sources": "The function `normalize_port` reads the input parameters `port` and `scheme` provided to it.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior or leaks information; the code only processes input data locally.",
  "flows": "Input `port` and `scheme` are processed; if `port` matches default for the scheme, it returns an empty string; otherwise, it returns the port number.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations are present. The code is straightforward and does not perform any external actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a default port mapping for various schemes. The function checks if the provided port is a digit, converts it to an integer and back to string for normalization, and removes default port numbers by returning an empty string if the port matches the default for the scheme. The logic is simple, with no external data sources or sinks, and no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for URL normalization purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard utility function with no malicious intent.",
