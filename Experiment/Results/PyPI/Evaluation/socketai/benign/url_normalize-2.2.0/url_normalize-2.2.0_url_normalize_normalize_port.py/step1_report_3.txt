  "purpose": "The code normalizes URL port components by removing default port numbers based on the URL scheme.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'port' parameter and the 'scheme' parameter as inputs.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs the normalized port string; no untrusted data is directly sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'port' and 'scheme' are processed; if 'port' matches a default port for the scheme, an empty string is returned; otherwise, the numeric port as string is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code is detected. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary mapping schemes to default ports and a function to normalize ports by removing default port numbers. The function checks if 'port' is numeric, converts it to an integer and back to string for normalization, and compares it with the default port for the scheme. If they match, it returns an empty string; otherwise, it returns the normalized port. No malicious or suspicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection, is present. The logic is simple and safe, intended for URL normalization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL port normalization utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply processes input data without side effects or malicious behavior.",
