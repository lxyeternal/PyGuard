{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to normalize the port component of a URL by removing default port numbers for known schemes.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'port' and 'scheme' parameters passed to 'normalize_port'.",
  "sinks": "The function returns the normalized port value; no direct sink actions are evident, but the output could be used downstream.",
  "flows": "Input port and scheme are processed; if port is a default port for the scheme, an empty string is returned; otherwise, the port is returned as a string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code performs straightforward normalization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations, defines a dictionary of default ports for common URL schemes, and contains a function that normalizes the port by removing default values. The function checks if 'port' is a digit, converts it to an integer string, compares it against the default port for the scheme, and returns either an empty string or the port number. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The logic is simple and intended for URL processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard URL port normalization without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The implementation appears safe and straightforward.",
