  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims against the provided code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code defines a dictionary `DEFAULT_PORT` mapping schemes to their default ports.\n- The function `normalize_port`:\n  - Checks if `port` is a digit.\n  - Converts `port` to an integer and back to string to normalize (e.g., remove leading zeros).\n  - Compares the normalized port to the default port for the given `scheme`.\n  - If they match, returns an empty string; otherwise, returns the normalized port.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no complex logic, external dependencies, or suspicious operations. It performs a simple normalization task.\n\n- **Malicious behavior or malware:**  \n  No signs of malicious intent, such as network activity, data exfiltration, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  The code is clear and direct; no obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:**  \n  The function only processes input parameters and returns normalized data; no external calls or risky operations.\n\n- **Use of input data:**  \n  The inputs are strings, validated to be digits before processing, which is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports correctly describe the purpose: normalization of URL ports by removing default port numbers.\n- They correctly identify that the code reads `port` and `scheme`, processes them, and returns either an empty string or the port.\n- They note the absence of hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- The analysis in each report states that the code is benign, straightforward, and serves a utility purpose.\n\n**Scores:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- Obfuscated is 0 in all reports, correctly reflecting the code's transparency.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Recommendations:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior, so malware and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n- **Any anomalies or overlooked issues?**  \n  No. The code performs a standard normalization task with proper validation.\n\n- **Should any scores be adjusted?**  \n  No. The current scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious intent or activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\nThe code is a benign utility function for URL port normalization. The reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimate:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               |\n| Security Risk    | 0               |\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence from the code.",
