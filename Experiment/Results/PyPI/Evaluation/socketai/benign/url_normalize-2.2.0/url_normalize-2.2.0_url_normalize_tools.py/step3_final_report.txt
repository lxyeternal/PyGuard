  "purpose": "Provides URL parsing, normalization, and encoding/decoding utilities.",
  "sources": "Input URL string in deconstruct_url, URL components in reconstruct_url, strings in force_unicode, unquote, quote functions.",
  "sinks": "None; functions process data internally without external effects or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> deconstruct_url -> URL components -> reconstruct_url -> URL string; String normalization in unquote and force_unicode.",
  "anomalies": "Regex for userinfo and host extraction is standard; no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets; Unicode normalization and encoding handled securely.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URL parsing, reconstruction, and Unicode normalization using well-known libraries. No network activity, external data handling, or obfuscation is present. The regex is appropriate and safe. The functions do not contain any malicious or suspicious code. The malware score is correctly 0, as there is no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting transparency. The security risk score is very low (0 or 0.1), consistent with benign URL utilities. Overall, the code is safe, straightforward, and poses no security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented URL utility module with no malicious or suspicious features. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are 0, and the risk is minimal. No adjustments are necessary.",
