  "purpose": "The code provides URL normalization and encoding/decoding tools, including parsing, reconstructing URLs, and handling Unicode normalization.",
  "sources": "Input URL string for parsing, unquoting, or quoting functions.",
  "sinks": "Reconstructed URL string, normalized strings, or decoded/encoded URL components.",
  "flows": "Input URL string -> deconstruct_url() -> URL components -> reconstruct_url() -> URL string; Input string for unquote() and quote() -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. Functions perform standard URL processing and Unicode normalization.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard URL parsing, reconstruction, and normalization functions using well-known libraries and techniques. No suspicious code, external network activity, or data exfiltration methods are present. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The functions handle data securely and straightforwardly. Usage of regular expressions and Unicode normalization is standard practice. No apparent malicious intent or security vulnerabilities within this isolated module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate URL normalization utility without malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard URL parsing, reconstruction, and Unicode normalization tasks with no suspicious or harmful features.",
