  "purpose": "Provides URL normalization, parsing, reconstruction, and encoding/decoding functions for URLs.",
  "sources": "Input URL strings for parsing, unquoting, or quoting functions.",
  "sinks": "Reconstructed URL strings, normalized strings, and decoded data used internally or returned to caller.",
  "flows": "Input URL strings are parsed into components, manipulated (if any), and reconstructed; strings are unquoted/unencoded or quoted/encoded as needed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of standard libraries and functions without unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a URL data structure and functions for parsing, reconstructing, and encoding URLs, using standard Python libraries such as re, unicodedata, and urllib.parse. The functions perform straightforward transformations with no external network access, no code injection, no data leakage, and no suspicious logic. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected. The functions handle string encoding/decoding securely, and URL components are processed in a standard manner. Overall, the code is typical URL normalization utility functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard URL parsing and encoding operations without malicious behavior or security risks.",
