{
  "purpose": "Provides URL normalization, parsing, and encoding/decoding utilities for URL handling.",
  "sources": "URL input strings in functions deconstruct_url, unquote, and quote.",
  "sinks": "URL components used for reconstruction and processing; unquote and force_unicode functions for decoding URL-encoded data.",
  "flows": "Input URL strings are processed through deconstruct_url or unquote, then reconstructed via reconstruct_url; data is normalized with unicodedata.normalize in unquote.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious pattern matches, or unusual code behaviors. The code primarily handles URL parsing and encoding.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly parses URLs into components, reconstructs URLs from components, and handles URL encoding/decoding with proper Unicode normalization. No unsafe or suspicious behaviors are evident. There are no external network calls, no use of untrusted data sources beyond input parameters, and no malicious code constructs. The regex used for parsing userinfo and host appears standard, and encoding functions perform typical URL handling tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a URL normalization and handling utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard URL parsing, reconstruction, and encoding/decoding safely.",
