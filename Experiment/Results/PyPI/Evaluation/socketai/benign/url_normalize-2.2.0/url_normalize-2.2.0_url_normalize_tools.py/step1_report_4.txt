{
  "purpose": "Provide URL normalization and parsing utilities, including URL deconstruction, reconstruction, quoting, and unquoting.",
  "sources": "Input URLs provided to deconstruct_url, unquote, or quote functions.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; functions manipulate data locally without unsafe operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input URL or string -> functions process and transform data -> output string or URL object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard URL parsing, normalization, and string handling functions. It uses regular expressions for URL component extraction, standard urllib.parse functions for quoting/unquoting, and Unicode normalization. No external or untrusted data handling beyond basic string processing is present. No network calls, file operations, or credential handling. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard URL utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. It safely performs URL parsing and normalization operations without evident vulnerabilities or malicious code.",
