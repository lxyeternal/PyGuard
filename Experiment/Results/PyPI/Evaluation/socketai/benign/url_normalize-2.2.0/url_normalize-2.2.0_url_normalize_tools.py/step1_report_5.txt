  "purpose": "The code provides URL normalization, parsing, and reconstruction tools for handling URL components safely and consistently.",
  "sources": "Reads input URL strings in deconstruct_url, unquote, and force_unicode functions.",
  "sinks": "Reconstructs URLs and decodes or encodes URL components, potentially exposing untrusted data if misused.",
  "flows": "Input URL strings are processed by deconstruct_url or unquote/force_unicode, then possibly reconstructed or outputted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard libraries for URL handling and Unicode normalization without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script performs URL parsing and reconstruction, uses regex for URL auth extraction, normalizes Unicode, and encodes/decodes data. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. Functions handle data safely, with no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious modifications. No obfuscated code or external network interactions are present. The use of standard library functions reduces risk; no hardcoded secrets or malicious intent are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward URL normalization utility without any malicious or security-threatening behavior. It employs safe practices for string handling and URL parsing. There are no indications of malware, malicious data leaks, or security risks within this module.",
