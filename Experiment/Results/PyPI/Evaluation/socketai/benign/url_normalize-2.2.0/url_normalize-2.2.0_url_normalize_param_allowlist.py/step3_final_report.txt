{
  "purpose": "Provides a utility function to normalize hostnames and retrieve allowed URL query parameters based on a predefined or overridden allowlist.",
  "sources": "Host string input, allowlist parameter (dict or list)",
  "sinks": "Return of a set of allowed parameters; no external system interactions",
  "flows": "Input host -> normalization -> allowlist lookup -> output set",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data handling and normalization",
  "analysis": "The code normalizes the host by converting to lowercase, removing 'www.' prefix, and stripping port numbers. It then retrieves allowed query parameters from a default or provided allowlist, which can be a list or dict. No external calls, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The logic is simple, safe, and predictable, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. The function's purpose is purely to manage in-memory allowlists for URL parameters, with no side effects or external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for managing URL query parameter allowlists. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with its functionality.",
