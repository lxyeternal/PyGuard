{
  "purpose": "This code provides a utility to retrieve allowed URL query parameters based on the domain, primarily for validation or filtering purposes.",
  "sources": "The host parameter input, which is the domain name extracted from URL query parameters.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a set of allowed parameters; no direct data sinks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The input host is normalized, and then used to retrieve allowed parameters from a predefined allowlist or an override allowlist provided as input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses standard data structures and straightforward logic; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a default allowlist for specific domains and their query parameters. The get_allowed_params function normalizes the input host to match keys in the allowlist, handling 'www.' prefixes and ports. It then returns a set of permitted query parameters, or an empty set if the domain is not found or input is invalid. There is no input/output outside function parameters, no external network or system calls, and no obfuscation. The logic appears clean, intended solely for filtering URL query parameters based on domain, with no signs of malicious activity or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for filtering URL parameters. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It’s a straightforward utility for managing allowlisted URL query parameters.",
