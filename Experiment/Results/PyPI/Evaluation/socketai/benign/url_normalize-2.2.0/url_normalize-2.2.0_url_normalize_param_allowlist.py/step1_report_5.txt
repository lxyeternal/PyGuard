{
  "purpose": "Provide a function to retrieve allowed URL query parameters for specific domains, using a default allowlist with optional overrides.",
  "sources": "The host parameter input, the allowlist parameter input, and the DEFAULT_ALLOWLIST dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The set returned by the function, which could be used to filter or validate query parameters in URL processing.",
  "flows": "Host string is normalized and used to lookup allowed parameters in the allowlist; input data flows from parameters to the returned set.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a default allowlist of domains and their allowed URL query parameters. The function get_allowed_params takes a host and an optional allowlist, normalizes the host, and returns a set of allowed parameters. It handles different input types for allowlist, including lists and dictionaries. The logic for normalization and retrieval is straightforward and does not involve any untrusted data execution, network calls, or sensitive data handling. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security flaws are evident. The code is well-structured, and all data flows are predictable and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility function for managing URL parameter allowlists. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities found.",
