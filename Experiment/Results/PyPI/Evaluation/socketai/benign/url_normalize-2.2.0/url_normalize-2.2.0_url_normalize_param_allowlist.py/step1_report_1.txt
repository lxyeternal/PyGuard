{
  "purpose": "Provide a utility function to retrieve allowed URL query parameters for specific domains based on a default or custom allowlist.",
  "sources": "The function reads input from the 'host' parameter and optionally from the 'allowlist' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The function does not write data to external systems or files; it only returns a set of allowed parameters.",
  "flows": "Input 'host' is normalized and used to look up allowed parameters in the allowlist; 'allowlist' can override default allowlist or be directly used as a list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No suspicious or unusual code constructs. The function performs simple data validation and lookup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation for managing domain-specific URL parameter allowlists. It includes input normalization and flexible allowlist handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious data flows, or suspicious behavior. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are observed. The logic is simple, safe, and consistent with expected behavior for such a utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to manage domain allowlists for URL parameters. The overall security risk is very low.",
