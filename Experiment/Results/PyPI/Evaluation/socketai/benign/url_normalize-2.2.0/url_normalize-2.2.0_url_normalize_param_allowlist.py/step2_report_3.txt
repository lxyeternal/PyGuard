  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines a default allowlist for certain domains and their permitted URL query parameters.\n- The `get_allowed_params` function normalizes the host input (lowercase, remove 'www.', strip port), then retrieves the allowed parameters from the allowlist (default or overridden).\n- The code performs straightforward data lookup and normalization, with no external system interactions, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and performs simple data handling.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior are observed.\n- The analysis in each report emphasizes the lack of external network activity, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), and all reports assign malware scores of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports correctly interpret the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n- **Scores assigned to issues?**  \n  The malware scores are 0 across all reports, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code. The security risk scores are very low (0 or 0.1), which is reasonable.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are appropriately low given the benign nature.\n\n- **Malware score reflection?**  \n  Correct. The code does not exhibit malicious activity, and the malware score is 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on code analysis, not assumptions.\n\n- **Score consistency?**  \n  Yes. The scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, given the utility nature)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and safe for use. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code poses no security risk or malware threat. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware score correctly reflects the absence of malicious behavior.",
