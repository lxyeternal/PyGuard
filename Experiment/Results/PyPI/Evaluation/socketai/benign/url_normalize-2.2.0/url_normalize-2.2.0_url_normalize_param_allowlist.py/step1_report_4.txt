{
  "purpose": "Manage and retrieve allowed URL query parameters for specific domains based on an allowlist.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'host' (domain name), 'allowlist' (custom allowlist), and internal default allowlist.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing a set of allowed parameters; no data leakage or insecure operations present.",
  "flows": "Input 'host' and 'allowlist' flow through normalization and conditional logic to produce a set of allowed parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations. Functionality is straightforward and does not interact with external systems or perform risky actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a default allowlist for certain domains and provides a function to retrieve allowed query parameters based on input. It performs standard normalization of the host string and returns a set of allowed parameters. No external network access, credential handling, or data exfiltration appears to be present. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose is solely to manage a static allowlist, with safe handling of inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing URL query parameter allowlists with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates within a controlled scope, with no external dependencies or potentially dangerous operations.",
