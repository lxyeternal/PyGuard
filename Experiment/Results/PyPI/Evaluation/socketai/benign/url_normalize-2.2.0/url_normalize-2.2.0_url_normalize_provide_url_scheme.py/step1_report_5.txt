  "purpose": "Validate and ensure URLs have proper schemes, attaching default schemes when missing.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'url' and the optional 'default_scheme'.",
  "sinks": "String concatenation for returning the modified URL; no external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input 'url' is checked for scheme presence, possibly reconstructed, then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs URL scheme validation and correction. It inspects whether the URL contains a scheme, whether it starts with authority components, or is a file path. If no scheme is detected, it prepends a default scheme. If a scheme is present but not in the approved list, it leaves it unchanged. The logic is straightforward and aligns with standard URL processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code uses basic string operations and conditional checks, with no external calls or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL scheme validator and corrector with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs typical URL processing tasks securely.",
