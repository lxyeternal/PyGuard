{
  "purpose": "The code validates and attaches URL schemes to input URLs, ensuring they have proper schemes or defaults.",
  "sources": "The input URL string parameter 'url' which is read and processed to determine its scheme.",
  "sinks": "The returned URL string, which could be used downstream in network requests or URL handling, but the code itself does not perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The flow starts with the input 'url', checks for existing scheme or authority components, and either returns the original URL or constructs a new one with the default scheme or reconstructed scheme based on conditions.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs. It performs straightforward string manipulations and conditional logic. No hardcoded credentials or secret data are present. No obfuscation or unusual language features are used.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs validation and normalization of URL schemes. It checks for presence of a scheme indicator, reconstructs URLs without schemes, and handles special cases like file paths and authority schemes. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The logic is simple and transparent, with no suspicious external calls or obfuscated code. The function is safe and standard in URL processing contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL scheme validation and normalization function with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use and does not exhibit any malicious or sabotage behaviors.",
