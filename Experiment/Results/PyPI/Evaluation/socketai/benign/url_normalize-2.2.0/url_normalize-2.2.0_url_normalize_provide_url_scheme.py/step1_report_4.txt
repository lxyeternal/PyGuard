  "purpose": "Validate and ensure proper URL scheme formatting, attaching default scheme if missing.",
  "sources": "Input URL string parameter to the function 'provide_url_scheme'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement that outputs the potentially modified URL string.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> URL parsing and scheme validation -> Output URL with scheme attached or preserved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Function handles URL scheme validation straightforwardly.",
  "analysis": "The function checks if the URL contains a scheme indicator and whether it starts with specific schemes requiring authority. If no scheme is present, it prepends the default scheme. It correctly handles special cases like '//' and file paths. The scheme validation uses a whitelist of schemes ('http', 'https', 'ftp', 'ftps'), which reduces risk. No input is directly used insecurely, and the code does not perform unsafe operations, external network calls, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL scheme validator with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It correctly processes URLs, attaching a default scheme when necessary, and does not contain malicious or suspicious logic.",
