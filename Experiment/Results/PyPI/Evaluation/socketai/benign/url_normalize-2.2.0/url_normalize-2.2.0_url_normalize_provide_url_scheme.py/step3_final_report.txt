  "purpose": "URL scheme validation and normalization utility ensuring URLs have valid schemes or default schemes attached.",
  "sources": "Input URL string; internal string operations for scheme detection and manipulation.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Checks for existing scheme in URL -> Validates scheme against authority list -> Prepend default scheme if missing -> Return normalized URL.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward string handling, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic URL normalization by checking for schemes, handling URLs starting with '//' or file paths, and appending a default scheme when necessary. It only modifies URLs with schemes in the predefined list, leaving others unchanged. No external calls, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation are present. The logic is simple, transparent, and aligns with standard URL handling practices. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The minimal security risk score (0.1) in some reports reflects the potential for malformed or malicious inputs but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward URL normalization function with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified but could be set to zero for absolute safety. Overall, it poses no supply chain security threat.",
