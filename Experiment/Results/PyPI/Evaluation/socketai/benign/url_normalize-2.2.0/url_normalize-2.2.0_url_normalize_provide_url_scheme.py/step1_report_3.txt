  "purpose": "URL scheme validation and normalization for input URLs to ensure consistent and valid URL schemes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'url' that is provided to the provide_url_scheme function.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output the potentially modified URL; no external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'url' flows through validation and conditional logic to produce a normalized URL with scheme attached.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs straightforward URL validation and normalization.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if the URL contains a scheme, if it starts with //, or if it appears to be a file path, then either returns it as-is or prepends a default scheme. It only modifies the URL if the scheme is missing or needs normalization. The function handles typical URL cases without executing untrusted code or performing unsafe operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This module performs standard URL validation and normalization. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward and adheres to expected URL processing logic.",
