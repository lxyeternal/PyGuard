  "purpose": "Setup script for the nosexcover Python package, used for distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long description; no other data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; no sensitive operations or external data flows.",
  "flows": "Read from file → assign to variable → used in setup parameters; no malicious flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; straightforward setup script; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: reading a README file, configuring package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and entry points. It employs a try-except to handle missing README gracefully. All operations are typical for a Python package setup and do not involve any suspicious or malicious behavior. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, no embedded secrets, and no obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
