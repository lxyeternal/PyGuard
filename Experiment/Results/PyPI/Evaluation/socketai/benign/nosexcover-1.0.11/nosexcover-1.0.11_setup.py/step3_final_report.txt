  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'nosexcover', defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' (with broad exception handling), static data passed to setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data handling; no network or file system effects beyond initial read",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.rst' into variable, then passing static data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad 'except:' during file read, which could hide errors but is common in setup scripts",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The broad exception handling is a minor concern but not malicious. All scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of supply chain attack vectors or malicious behavior. The minor exception handling issue does not elevate the security risk. The scores are accurate and conservative, reflecting the safe and standard nature of the script.",
