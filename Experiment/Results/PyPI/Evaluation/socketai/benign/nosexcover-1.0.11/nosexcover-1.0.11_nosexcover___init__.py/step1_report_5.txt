  "purpose": "Import the XCoverage class from a local module named nosexcover.",
  "sources": "The import statement is the only source, which loads a class from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only imports a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in this minimal snippet; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module, which is common in Python projects. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity. As this is just an import statement, it does not perform any actions that could indicate malicious intent. Without additional context or code, there is no evidence of security risks or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It appears to be a standard component of a larger project.",
