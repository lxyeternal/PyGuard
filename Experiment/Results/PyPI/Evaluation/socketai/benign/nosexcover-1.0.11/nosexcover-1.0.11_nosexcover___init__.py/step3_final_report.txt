{
  "purpose": "Import the XCoverage class from a local module named nosexcover, likely for code coverage or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which reads the module nosexcover and the class XCoverage.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only imports a class without executing or passing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a local module, with no additional logic, data handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the minimal code snippet. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforwardness of the code. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present. The module name suggests testing or coverage, which is benign. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward import statement with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
