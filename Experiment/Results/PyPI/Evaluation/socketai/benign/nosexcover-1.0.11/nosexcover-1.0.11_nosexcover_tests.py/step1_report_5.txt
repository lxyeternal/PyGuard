  "purpose": "Import statement for the XCoverage class from the nosexcover module, likely for testing or coverage analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads from an import statement, importing 'XCoverage' from 'nosexcover'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process data or perform actions beyond the import.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only contains an import statement within a function.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'test_sanity' only performs an import; no other logic, data processing, or suspicious activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that imports a module/component but does not execute any logic, data handling, or network activity. This is a minimal and typical import statement for testing purposes and does not exhibit malicious behavior or malicious intent. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test function performing a simple import, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
