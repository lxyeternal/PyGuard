  "purpose": "A minimal test function importing a class from an external module, likely for testing or coverage purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'nosexcover' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Import statement; no data flow from source to sink beyond the import itself.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple test function that imports a class from an external module. There are no data flows, network activity, or malicious behaviors. The module name suggests a testing or coverage tool, not malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign, minimal nature of the code. No logical flaws or suspicious activity are present. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9-1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores and assessments in all reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
