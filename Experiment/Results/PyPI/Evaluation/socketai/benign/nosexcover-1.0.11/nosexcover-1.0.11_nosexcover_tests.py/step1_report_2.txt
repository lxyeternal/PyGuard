{
  "purpose": "Import the XCoverage class from the nosexcover module, likely for code coverage analysis or testing.",
  "sources": "The import statement from nosexcover import XCoverage",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "No data flow; only an import statement with no further code execution",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no suspicious or unusual activity beyond a simple import. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test function 'test_sanity' that imports a module 'nosexcover' and the class 'XCoverage' from it. There are no other statements, data manipulations, or network interactions. The import itself appears standard; no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system modification is evident. The minimal code suggests this may be part of a larger test suite, but on its own, it does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and non-malicious, serving likely as a test or placeholder. No malicious intent or security issues are identified.",
