{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points without executing any untrusted code or performing network operations.",
  "sources": "Reading local files ('README.rst', 'CHANGES.rst') for long descriptions; importing modules; defining setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network connections, code execution, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "File reading operations flow into the setup configuration; no malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and follows typical packaging patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads local files safely with exception handling, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The code is typical for Python package setup, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero, with high confidence (1), reflecting the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
