{
  "purpose": "The code aims to provide compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3 for string handling, base64 encoding, SSL error handling, config parsing, and URL quoting.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports and defines functions and variables based on the Python version detected.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform potentially dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules and defining functions/variables based on environment detection, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code mainly focuses on compatibility setup.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version to assign appropriate types and functions, importing modules conditionally to maintain compatibility. It defines functions for byte conversion and encoding/decoding based on the environment, without handling any input data or performing operations that process untrusted inputs. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors detected. The code's intent is purely to facilitate compatibility across Python versions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a compatibility shim without malicious intent or security risks. It does not handle sensitive data, perform network operations, or contain malicious payloads. It is safe and standard for cross-version compatibility.",
