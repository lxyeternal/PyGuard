  "purpose": "Compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, handling imports and defining functions for cross-version support.",
  "sources": "Import statements and environment detection logic; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; functions are for internal compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility shim, using standard import fallbacks and defining functions like 'from_octets' and 'encodestring' based on Python version. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or execute untrusted code. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The use of base64 functions is standard and not inherently malicious. The code's structure is clear, with comments explaining purpose. No anomalies or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and intended solely for compatibility between Python versions. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
