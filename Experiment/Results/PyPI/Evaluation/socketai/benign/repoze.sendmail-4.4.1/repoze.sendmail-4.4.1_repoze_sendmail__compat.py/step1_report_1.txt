{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up compatibility for Python 2 and 3, importing modules and defining functions for string handling, base64 encoding, SSL errors, config parsing, and URL quoting.",
  "sources": "Module imports and variable definitions (base64, codecs, SSL, configparser, urllib.parse).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no output, network, or data storage operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly sets up compatibility functions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. The code is standard for compatibility handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection and compatibility setup for Python 2 and 3, including string handling, base64 encoding, SSL error handling, configuration parsing, and URL quoting. All imports are from standard libraries. No input sources or output sinks are present; no network or file operations are executed. The code is straightforward and typical for cross-version compatibility, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility shim for supporting Python 2 and 3. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no anomalies. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
