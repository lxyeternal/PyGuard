{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility functions for handling strings, encoding, and importing modules across Python 2 and Python 3 environments.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (base64, codecs, ssl, socket, configparser, urllib), and variable assignments/definitions.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing, no external data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily initializes compatibility functions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic version compatibility code is standard and not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines compatibility shims for string handling, base64 encoding, and module imports across Python versions. It conditionally assigns functions based on the Python environment, which is common in cross-version compatibility layers. No evidence of malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is present. The code solely sets up environment-specific functions and imports, with no external communication, data manipulation, or potentially malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not process or leak sensitive data, nor does it contain malicious code. It is a benign, standard utility setup for cross-version support.",
