  "conclusion": "The script demonstrates unsafe security practices by executing remote code without validation, posing a high risk of remote code execution vulnerabilities. While no malicious payloads are confirmed, the pattern itself is dangerous and should be replaced with safer alternatives such as code validation, signatures, or local scripts."
