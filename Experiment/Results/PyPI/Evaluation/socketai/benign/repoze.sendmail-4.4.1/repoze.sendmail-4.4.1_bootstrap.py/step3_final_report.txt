  "sinks": "exec() executes the fetched code; os.spawnle() spawns a subprocess to run Python commands.",
  "flows": "Fetch remote code -> execute with exec() -> spawn subprocess with environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on remote code without validation; dynamic environment variable manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches a Python script over HTTP and executes it directly via exec(), which is inherently unsafe as it can run malicious code if the remote source is compromised. It then spawns a subprocess to run Python with specific environment variables, further increasing risk. No validation or signature checks are performed on the fetched code. The practice of executing remote code without validation is a significant security concern, especially since the code is fetched over unencrypted HTTP.",
  "conclusion": "The script demonstrates unsafe security practices by executing remote code without validation, posing a high risk of remote code execution vulnerabilities. While no malicious payloads are confirmed, the pattern itself is dangerous and should be replaced with safer alternatives such as code validation, signatures, or local scripts.",
