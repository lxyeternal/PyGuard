{
  "purpose": "Define interfaces for email delivery mechanisms and mailer components in a transaction-aware email sending system.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters (`fromaddr`, `toaddrs`, `message`) and class attribute (`transaction_manager`).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the `send` methods where email messages are processed and sent; however, actual sending logic is not present here.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into the `send` methods; message IDs are generated if missing. The flow does not include actual transmission, only interface definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are present. The code strictly defines interfaces without implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides interface definitions for email delivery (`IMailDelivery`) and mailer (`IMailer`). It describes the process flow for sending emails within a transactional context but contains no executable logic or data handling beyond method signatures. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows. The code appears to be standard interface declarations for a mailing system.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward definition of email interface abstractions without any executable logic, data handling, or suspicious features. It does not contain malicious code or security risks. The code is safe and conventional for its purpose.",
