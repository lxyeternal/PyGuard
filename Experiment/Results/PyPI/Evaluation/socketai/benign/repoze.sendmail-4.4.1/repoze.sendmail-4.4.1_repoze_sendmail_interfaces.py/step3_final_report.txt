{
  "purpose": "Defines interfaces for email delivery components (`IMailDelivery` and `IMailer`) with detailed documentation, serving as a contract for implementations.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only method signatures and comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; interface declarations without executable code.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of implementation, data handling, or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of interface definitions with comprehensive comments. There are no executable statements, data processing, or external interactions. No anomalies, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the purely declarative nature of the code. The code aligns with standard practices for defining interfaces in Python, especially within a Zope environment, and does not introduce any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of interface definitions for email components, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores are justified and accurate.",
