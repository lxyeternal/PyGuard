  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Content:** Interface definitions for `IMailDelivery` and `IMailer` with detailed comments.\n- **Findings:** No executable code, no data processing, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate, as there is no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk.\n- **Comments:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. The code is purely interface definitions, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Content:** Similar interface definitions with standard practices.\n- **Findings:** No external data sources, no executable logic, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly identifies the code as safe and purely declarative.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Content:** Again, interface definitions with detailed comments.\n- **Findings:** No data processing, no external data, no malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The analysis is consistent; the code is safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Content:** Interface definitions with clear method signatures.\n- **Findings:** No implementation, no data handling, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly assesses the code as safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Content:** Interface definitions with some mention of data flow.\n- **Findings:** No actual data processing, no executable logic, only method signatures.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The assessment is accurate; no malicious or risky content.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of interface definitions with no executable logic, data handling, or malicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are appropriately set to 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The security risk scores are 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious features.\n\n### Final Estimation:\nGiven the nature of the code—pure interface definitions with no executable or malicious content—I concur with the existing scores.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nThere is no indication of any hidden malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The code is standard, well-documented interface definitions for email delivery components.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code content. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
