  "purpose": "Standard namespace package declaration in Python, using pkg_resources or pkgutil for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements of pkg_resources and pkgutil, and the assignment to __path__.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code simply declares namespace handling.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, well-known pattern with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python namespace package setup, using try-except to declare namespace with pkg_resources, falling back to pkgutil. It involves no data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace package declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is warranted.",
