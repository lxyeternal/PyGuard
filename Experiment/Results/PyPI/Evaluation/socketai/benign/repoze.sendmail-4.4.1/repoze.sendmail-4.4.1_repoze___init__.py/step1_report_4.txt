{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a namespace package in Python, allowing the package to be split across multiple distributions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'pkg_resources' and 'pkgutil' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "Importing modules and declaring namespace, no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except for optional import is standard for compatibility; no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package using 'pkg_resources'. If 'pkg_resources' is not available, it falls back to 'pkgutil' to extend the package path. Both are standard practices for namespace packages. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated code are present. No external network activity or data exfiltration points are evident. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python packaging standards.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for Python namespace packages with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
