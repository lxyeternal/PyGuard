  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package to enable multiple distribution packages to contribute to the same namespace.",
  "sources": "The import statements for pkg_resources and pkgutil, and the __path__ assignment.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "Importing and handling namespace package setup without data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard namespace package declaration patterns; no suspicious or unusual behavior observed. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package using 'pkg_resources' if available, falling back to 'pkgutil' if not. This pattern is common for namespace packages in Python and does not involve any data processing or security-sensitive operations. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code structure and logic are straightforward and typical for namespace package declarations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a namespace package setup with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs a benign function essential for package organization, with no anomalous or suspicious elements.",
