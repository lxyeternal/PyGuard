  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package to allow multiple distribution packages to share a common namespace.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pkg_resources and pkgutil.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is only setting up namespace declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard namespace package pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package using pkg_resources.declare_namespace or pkgutil.extend_path. These are standard methods for creating namespace packages in Python. The try-except block ensures compatibility across different environments. No input, data leak, or malicious behavior is present. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or suspicious logic. It solely manages package namespace setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions to facilitate modular packaging. No security issues are detected.",
