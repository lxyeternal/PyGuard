  "purpose": "Define a namespace package for modular distribution",
  "sources": "Import statements for pkg_resources and pkgutil",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external outputs",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; standard namespace package pattern",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package using pkg_resources, falling back to pkgutil if ImportError occurs. This pattern is standard for creating namespace packages in Python. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or execute untrusted code. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code's structure and imports are consistent with common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical namespace package declaration with no malicious intent or security risks.",
