  "purpose": "The code is intended to convert a directory into a Python package by adding an __init__.py file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the directory path provided, likely through the filesystem operations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network operations, file leaks, or execution of untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Input (directory path) → create __init__.py in directory",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or malicious code patterns detected; the code is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code simply instructs to make a directory a package by adding an __init__.py file. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. It does not perform any network operations, execute untrusted code, or contain hardcoded credentials. The code is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign instruction to convert a directory into a Python package. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
