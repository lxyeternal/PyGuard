  "purpose": "Adding __init__.py to a directory to make it a Python package.",

  "sinks": "Writing __init__.py files, potentially from untrusted input paths.",
  "flows": "Input directory path -> filesystem write operation of __init__.py",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward filesystem operations to create __init__.py files in specified directories. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks are evident. Slight concern exists if directory paths are sourced from untrusted input, which could lead to filesystem manipulation, but no malicious intent is detected. The scores reflect benign operations with minimal security risk in one case.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, involving simple filesystem modifications or comments. No malware or obfuscation detected. The minor security risk score in one report is justified if input trustworthiness is uncertain, but overall, the supply chain security posture is very low risk.",
