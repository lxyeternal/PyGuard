{
  "purpose": "Provide Jupyter Notebook compatible progress bars with enhanced visualization using ipywidgets.",
  "sources": "Reads module imports, IPython widget imports, user-provided parameters, and display functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses IPython.display.display to render widgets; no external or untrusted data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and widget states flow into display and update methods, affecting visual output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. Use of proxy references is standard for weakref.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a progress bar for Jupyter notebooks using ipywidgets, handling multiple IPython versions and deprecations. It manipulates widget properties and displays progress without external data transmission. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious side effects are present. The use of warnings, imports, and widget management follows typical patterns for such integrations. No suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malware signatures identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an IPython/Jupyter notebook progress bar with no malicious intent or security issues. It focuses on visualization and compatibility across versions without attempting to access or transmit sensitive data.",
