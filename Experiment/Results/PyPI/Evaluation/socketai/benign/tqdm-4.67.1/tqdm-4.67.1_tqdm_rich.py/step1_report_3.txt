{
  "purpose": "Provides a rich.progress-based progress bar implementation for iterators, extending tqdm functionality with a GUI style.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as 'warnings', 'rich.progress' components, and internal modules for warnings and standard tqdm.",
  "sinks": "None identified where untrusted data is used to influence system behavior, perform data leaks, or execute commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted input to dangerous sinks; the code mainly sets up progress display components.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Uses warnings for experimental features and constructs progress bars.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines custom progress bar classes and functions for visual progress tracking, with no evident malicious activity. It extends existing progress components, creates a GUI progress class, and provides alias functions. No code injection, network communication, or data theft mechanisms are present. No suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscation detected. The only notable aspect is the use of warnings indicating experimental status, which is typical for alpha features.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign extension of tqdm with rich progress display, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use, with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
