  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, benign extension of tqdm with rich visualization. Uses warnings appropriately.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, standard library usage, benign warnings about experimental features.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score but justified given the experimental warning; still benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Similar benign extension, no suspicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, straightforward extension, benign warnings.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, standard pattern, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; 0 is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated (0.1-0.2) due to use of warnings about experimental features, but no actual security risks or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- The risk scores could be marginally increased to 0.2 for conservative caution, but given the absence of any actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, 0.1-0.2 remains reasonable.\n- The malware score should remain at 0; no evidence of malicious code.\n\n### Overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (current scores are justified; no change needed)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, well-structured extension of tqdm with rich visualization features. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
