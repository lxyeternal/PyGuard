{
  "purpose": "Provides a rich.progress-based visual progress bar for iterators, extending tqdm functionality with an experimental GUI implementation.",
  "sources": "Imports from warnings, rich.progress, and internal modules (.std). Reads configuration options, progress bar settings, and class parameters. Uses tqdm range and tqdm functions for iteration.",
  "sinks": "Calls to super().__init__() in tqdm_rich and trrange; updates progress via self._prog.update() and self._prog.reset(). No untrusted data handling or external network access observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization parameters flow from constructor to rich.progress.Progress instance; progress updates via display() and reset() methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets detected. Usage of warnings.warn() for experimental status, but no malicious or obfuscated patterns found.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom progress bar classes using the rich library, extending tqdm for enhanced visual display. It includes standard progress components like FractionColumn and RateColumn. The tqdm_rich class initializes a rich Progress object, manages progress updates, and overrides methods for display, reset, and close. No input from untrusted sources, no network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward extension of tqdm with rich visualizations. It uses warnings to inform about experimental features but does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension for progress visualization, with no indicators of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code segments and appears to be a legitimate enhancement of tqdm for visual progress reporting.",
