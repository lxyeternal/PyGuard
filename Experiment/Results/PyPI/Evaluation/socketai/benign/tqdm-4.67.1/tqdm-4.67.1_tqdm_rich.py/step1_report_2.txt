{
  "purpose": "Provides a rich.progress-based visual progress bar for iterators, extending tqdm functionality with a GUI/visual component.",
  "sources": "Imports from warnings, rich.progress, and internal modules; reads parameters like 'progress', 'options', 'disable', 'desc', 'leave', 'unit_scale', 'unit_divisor', 'unit', 'total', and 'n'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'warn' to emit warnings; updates and displays progress bars via rich.progress's Progress class; no untrusted data sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Parameters are read during class initialization and method calls; progress and options flow into Progress objects; warnings are issued during class instantiation; progress bars are updated and displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden code; the code relies on standard libraries and well-known packages; no obfuscated code or unusual runtime behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom progress display columns, a subclass of tqdm for rich progress visualization, and shortcut functions. It imports standard modules and rich.progress components. The code mainly manages progress bar creation, updating, and display. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are evident. The use of warnings for experimental features and the reliance on publicly available packages suggest a benign intent. The overall structure and logic are consistent with standard progress bar implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, experimental extension of tqdm for visual progress indication using rich. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall malware score is very low, and no security threats are evident.",
