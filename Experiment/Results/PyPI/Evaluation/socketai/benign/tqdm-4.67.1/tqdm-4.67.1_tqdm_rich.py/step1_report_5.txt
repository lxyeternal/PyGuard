{
  "purpose": "Provides a custom progress bar implementation using rich.progress integrated with tqdm, supporting visual progress indicators in terminal applications.",
  "sources": "Imports from rich.progress and a local std.tqdm, reading configuration and warning settings; no direct input reading in this fragment.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks such as network or filesystem operations.",
  "flows": "N/A — no source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. Uses warnings for experimental features but no malicious or suspicious logic is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes for custom progress bar columns, a subclass of tqdm that integrates with rich for enhanced display, and utility functions. It imports standard and third-party modules responsibly, with no signs of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The warnings relate to the experimental status of the library. No network operations, system manipulations, or credential handling are present. The code appears well-structured for its purpose, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a rich.progress-based progress bar extension for tqdm. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. It is safe based on the provided fragment.",
