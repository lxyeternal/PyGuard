{
  "purpose": "Provides a rich.progress-based visual progress bar for iterators, extending tqdm functionality with a GUI/visual component.",
  "sources": "Imports from warnings, rich.progress, and local modules; no external input sources like user input, environment variables, or network requests.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no code writes untrusted data, sends data over network, or executes untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks that indicates malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. Uses warning for experimental features, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom progress bar classes and a wrapper around tqdm for rich visual output. It imports standard libraries, performs no network or file I/O, and only extends tqdm with visual features. The warning about experimental features is informative, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation is evident. The code appears to be a benign enhancement of tqdm for GUI progress bars.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign extension of tqdm with rich progress display capabilities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply enhances user interface features and uses warnings appropriately for experimental features.",
