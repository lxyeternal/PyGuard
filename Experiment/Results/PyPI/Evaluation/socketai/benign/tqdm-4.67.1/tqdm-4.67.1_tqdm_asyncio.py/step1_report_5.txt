{
  "purpose": "Provides an asynchronous progress bar decorator for iterators, including integration with asyncio tasks and range objects.",
  "sources": "Reads the iterable passed to tqdm_asyncio, especially checking for __anext__ and __next__ methods, and the input to tarange and other class methods.",
  "sinks": "Uses asyncio.as_completed and asyncio.gather to handle asynchronous tasks, but only within the context of progress tracking; no data leak or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Input iterables are checked and wrapped; asynchronous functions gather and process data from these iterables; progress updates are managed internally without external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code follows standard patterns for async iteration and progress tracking. No obfuscated language features or misleading variable usage identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an asyncio-compatible tqdm progress bar wrapper, handling different types of iterables and asynchronous task management. It performs method attribute checks for __anext__ and __next__, wraps asyncio.as_completed and asyncio.gather for progress tracking, and provides convenience functions. The implementation appears standard for a progress bar utility with no signs of malicious behavior. No external network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an asynchronous progress bar utility for Python, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any external communication or data theft, and all functions serve a legitimate purpose related to progress tracking in asynchronous contexts.",
