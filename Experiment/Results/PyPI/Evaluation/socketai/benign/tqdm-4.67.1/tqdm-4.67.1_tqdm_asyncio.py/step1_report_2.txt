{
  "purpose": "Provide asynchronous progress bars for iterators, including a default range iterator with output to stderr.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, asyncio, and local std module; usage of __anext__, __next__, asyncio.as_completed, asyncio.gather, and range.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly observed; no untrusted data outputs or external communications.",
  "flows": "Initialization of tqdm_asyncio with iterable → methods __aiter__, __anext__ handle iteration and update progress → as_completed and gather methods manage asynchronous execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behaviors. Use of asyncio constructs is standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden network activities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an asynchronous tqdm progress bar class for iterators, with methods to handle asynchronous iteration (__anext__), and to wrap asyncio functions (as_completed, gather). It supports both async and sync iterables, updating progress accordingly. The code appears to be a legitimate utility module, relying on standard asyncio functions and no external network activity or data exfiltration. No obfuscated code, no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of an async progress bar utility, with no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or sabotage. It operates solely within the scope of progress tracking during asynchronous iteration.",
