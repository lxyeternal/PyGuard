{
  "purpose": "Provides an asynchronous progress bar for iterators, including support for async generators and compatibility with asyncio functions.",
  "sources": "Imports asyncio, version_info, and local module .std; reads iterable parameters; reads system version info.",
  "sinks": "Calls functions like asyncio.as_completed, asyncio.gather, and iterable methods; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input iterables flow into class initialization; async functions handle asynchronous iteration; data flows through methods like __anext__, gather, as_completed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious external calls; the code structure is typical for an asyncio progress bar utility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for async iteration with progress display, wrapping asyncio functions and handling iterables properly. It does not include any external network calls, file operations, or suspicious logic. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system compromise are present. The code relies solely on standard asyncio patterns and local module imports. The purpose is purely to provide a user-friendly async progress bar, with no suspicious anomalies or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an asynchronous progress bar for iterables, with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It follows typical patterns for async iteration and progress display without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
