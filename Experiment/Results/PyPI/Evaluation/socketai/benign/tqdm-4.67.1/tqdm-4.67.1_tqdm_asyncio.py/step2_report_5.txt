  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is a legitimate async progress bar with no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and standard asyncio usage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** Given the code's straightforward nature, standard asyncio patterns, and lack of suspicious activity, these scores seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here. The reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it finds no suspicious activity, no external network calls, and confirms the code's legitimacy.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is consistent with the code's behavior, which is a utility for async progress reporting.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the review finds no malicious or suspicious patterns, emphasizing standard asyncio and progress bar functionality.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** The code's purpose and implementation are benign, matching the scores.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The review confirms the code is a standard asyncio progress bar, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate scores.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, finds no malicious or suspicious behavior, emphasizing the standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Justification:** Slightly lower risk score, but still reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation; scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly at 0.2 or 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern, which aligns with the code's benign purpose.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or suggested)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low risk, mainly due to the utility nature, not security issues)\n\n**In conclusion,** the reports are consistent with the code's behavior, and the scores are reasonable. No adjustments are necessary. The code appears to be a well-implemented, standard async progress bar utility with no security concerns.",
