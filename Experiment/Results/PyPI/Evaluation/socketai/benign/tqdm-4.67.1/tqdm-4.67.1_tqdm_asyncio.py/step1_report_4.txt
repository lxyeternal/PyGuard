{
  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous progress bar decorators and utilities for iterators, including integration with asyncio tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard modules (asyncio, sys), local module (.std), and the iterable input provided to classes/functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Input iterable (source) -> wrapped methods (as_completed, gather) -> progress updates (internal to tqdm) -> return values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for async progress bars based on tqdm, wrapping asyncio functions (as_completed, gather). It properly handles standard iteration and async iteration protocols, without executing or executing untrusted code or making network connections. No embedded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. The code leverages standard Python features and modules, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an asyncio-compatible progress bar utility based on tqdm. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are evident from the provided code.",
