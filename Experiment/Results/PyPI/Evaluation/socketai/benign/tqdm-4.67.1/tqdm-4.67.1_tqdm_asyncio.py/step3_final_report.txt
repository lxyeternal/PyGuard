{
  "purpose": "Provides an asynchronous progress bar utility compatible with asyncio, wrapping around asyncio tasks, ranges, and iterables to display progress updates.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from iterables, asyncio futures, and coroutines via attribute checks (__anext__, __next__) and asyncio functions like asyncio.as_completed and asyncio.gather.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data flows through asyncio tasks and coroutines; however, there are no external data sinks or network communications present.",
  "flows": "Source data (iterables or asyncio futures) is processed via attribute checks and wrapped in progress tracking; results are collected and sorted after completion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard asyncio patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard asyncio-compatible progress bar, wrapping asyncio functions and iterables. It performs attribute checks to handle different iterable types, uses asyncio.as_completed and asyncio.gather to manage concurrent tasks, and updates progress accordingly. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The code is well-structured, readable, and relies solely on standard Python asyncio features. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for asynchronous progress tracking based on tqdm and asyncio. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scoring accurately reflects its benign and standard nature. Minor adjustments to risk scores could be made to lower them slightly, but overall, the assessments are correct.",
