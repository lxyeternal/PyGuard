{
  "purpose": "Implement an asynchronous progress bar decorator for iterators, including support for asyncio tasks and ranges.",
  "sources": "Imports of asyncio, sys.version_info, and local modules; class methods and functions that process iterables and futures.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink locations where untrusted data flows into critical security points.",
  "flows": "Iterables are processed in the __init__ method; async methods gather results; progress updates occur via self.update().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs; standard async iteration patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for async-friendly progress bars, wrapping around asyncio tasks and iterables. It uses standard asyncio functions like as_completed and gather, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or network activity. No hardcoded credentials or malicious operations are present. The only notable behavior is the wrapping of asyncio futures for progress reporting, which is standard practice. The code appears well-structured, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate asynchronous progress bar implementation with no signs of malicious behavior. It utilizes standard asyncio features and does not contain any malicious or security-compromising code.",
