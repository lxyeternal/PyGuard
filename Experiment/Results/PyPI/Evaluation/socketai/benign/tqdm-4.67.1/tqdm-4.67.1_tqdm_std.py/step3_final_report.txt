  "purpose": "A comprehensive progress bar utility for iterables, supporting threading, environment detection, pandas integration, and customizable formatting.",
  "sources": "Input from iterables, environment variables, and configuration parameters; output to sys.stderr or other streams.",
  "sinks": "Standard output streams; no network or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through formatting and display functions, with updates triggered by method calls; no suspicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, network activity, obfuscation, or system modifications; uses standard modules and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, open-source progress bar implementation with features like threading locks, environment-aware resizing, pandas patching, and safe IO handling. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or covert channels are present. The use of environment variables and threading locks is standard for such utilities. No signs of network activity, data theft, or obfuscation are detected. The code's clarity and adherence to common practices support its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign progress bar utility with no malicious intent or sabotage. It employs standard patterns and modules, with no suspicious behaviors. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero.",
