  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a widely-used, feature-rich progress bar implementation. No suspicious activity, no external network calls, no obfuscation, no credentials, no data exfiltration, no system modifications. Uses standard modules, thread locks, environment variables for configuration, and internal utility modules.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low, consistent with a benign utility)\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code appears to be a legitimate progress bar library with no malicious behavior. The low security risk score is appropriate, but a small value (0.2) is assigned possibly due to environment variable usage or threading complexity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the safe, comprehensive design, with environment-aware resizing, pandas integration, thread safety, and no malicious patterns. Uses standard Python modules, no network activity, no obfuscation, no credentials.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and aligns with the code's purpose. The very low malware and security risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—safe, standard progress bar with environment interaction, threading, pandas support, no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue:** Empty response—no analysis provided.\n\n**Assessment:** No information to evaluate, but no suspicious activity is indicated.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others—progress bar with threading, environment variables, output streams, pandas patching, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion is that the code is benign and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code is a legitimate progress bar implementation.\n- **Malicious activity:** No reports indicate network activity, data exfiltration, code obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious system modifications.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** Very low, primarily due to environment variable use and threading complexity, but these are standard for such utilities.\n\n### Justification of scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports is justified. No malicious patterns are present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of malicious activity, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities, a very low score (around 0.1) is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no signs of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (minimal, mostly due to environment interaction, which is benign)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, safe, and widely used progress bar utility with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**The code is safe, legitimate, and free of malware or obfuscation.**  \n**Risk score: approximately 0.1**  \n**Malware score: 0**  \n**Obfuscated score: 0**",
