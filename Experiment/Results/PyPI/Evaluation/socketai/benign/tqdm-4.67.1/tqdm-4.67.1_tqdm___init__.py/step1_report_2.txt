{
  "purpose": "This code defines imports and wrapper functions for the tqdm library, including deprecation warnings for outdated functions.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and functions from the same package and uses the 'warn' function from the 'warnings' module.",
  "sinks": "The 'warn' function outputs warnings, but these are for deprecation notices; no untrusted data or external effects are evident.",
  "flows": "The functions call internal module functions after issuing warnings; no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. All functions serve standard deprecation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module imports and defines wrapper functions that issue deprecation warnings before calling internal functions. No external data input, network activity, or suspicious behavior is detected. The use of 'warn' is standard for deprecation notices. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module setup with deprecation warnings and imports. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears safe and standard for maintaining backward compatibility.",
