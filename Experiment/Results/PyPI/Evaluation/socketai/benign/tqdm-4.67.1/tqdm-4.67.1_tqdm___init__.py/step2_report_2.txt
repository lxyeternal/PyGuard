  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is part of a progress bar library, mainly importing modules and defining deprecated functions that issue warnings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Warnings are standard deprecation notices; no untrusted data or external effects.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard for maintaining backward compatibility, with no malicious or security concerns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (since it's just deprecation warnings, very low risk).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on deprecated functions with warnings.\n- No suspicious behavior, secrets, or malicious code.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (standard deprecation).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: import statements, wrapper functions, deprecation warnings.\n- No external data handling or suspicious activity.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to previous, mainly import statements and deprecation warnings.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Again, import statements, wrapper functions, deprecation warnings.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, primarily due to deprecation warnings and standard library code.\n\n### Justification:\n- The code is mainly for backward compatibility, issuing deprecation warnings, and importing modules.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or sensitive data handling.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- The deprecation warnings are standard practice, not indicative of security issues.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (since it's a library maintenance code with deprecation warnings, very low risk)\n\nThis aligns with the overall benign nature of the code and the reports' findings.",
