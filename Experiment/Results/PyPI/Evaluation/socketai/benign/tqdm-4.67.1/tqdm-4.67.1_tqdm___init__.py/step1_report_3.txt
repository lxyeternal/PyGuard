{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports functions and imports related to progress bars, primarily for use in notebooks and command-line interfaces, with some deprecated functions that issue warnings about future removal.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (_monitor, _tqdm_pandas, cli, gui, std, version, notebook), and internal function calls for tqdm, trange, and warnings.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink points include the use of warnings.warn and the import of modules that could be malicious if tampered with, but here they seem benign. The functions themselves call imported functions with user-supplied arguments.",
  "flows": "External data could flow via function arguments into tqdm functions, but these are standard library functions; no untrusted external data sources are explicitly read in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Deprecated functions issue warnings about future removal, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, defining functions that wrap other tqdm functions, and issuing warnings for deprecated functions. There are no input reading sources, no data sinks that leak data, nor evident data flows from untrusted sources. The warnings issued are standard deprecation notices and do not contain malicious content. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present. The code appears to be well-structured and intended for backward compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, focusing on exporting progress bar functions and issuing deprecation warnings. No malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain attacks are evident. The functions perform standard operations with no indications of data leaks or malicious intent.",
