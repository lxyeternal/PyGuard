{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package for progress bars, providing functions and imports related to tqdm.",
  "sources": "The code reads from local modules (e.g., ._monitor, ._tqdm_pandas, .cli, .gui, .std, .version, .notebook) and imports functions, classes, and variables.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks involving untrusted data handling, network operations, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code mainly involves importing modules, defining functions that generate warnings, and returning imported objects. The flow involves function calls that produce warnings, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspects are deprecation warnings instructing users to change their code, which are standard for library evolution. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module imports and provides deprecated wrapper functions with warning messages. These functions warn users about future changes but do not execute any harmful or malicious actions. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. The code adheres to normal practices for maintaining a Python package, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard library module for progress bar utilities, with deprecation warnings for older functions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain attacks. The code is safe based on the provided snippet.",
