  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe component of a Python library handling backward compatibility and user notifications. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The low risk score (~0.1) assigned in previous reports is appropriate, primarily due to deprecation warnings which are benign. Overall, the supply chain security risk for this code snippet is negligible."
