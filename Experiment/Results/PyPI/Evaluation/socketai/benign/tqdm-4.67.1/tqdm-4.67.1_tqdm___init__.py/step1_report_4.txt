{
  "purpose": "This code provides module imports, deprecation warnings, and wrapper functions for tqdm progress bar functionalities, including notebook-specific features.",
  "sources": "The code reads from local module files (._monitor, ._tqdm_pandas, .cli, .gui, .std, .version, .notebook). It also imports from the warnings module and internal tqdm modules.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the warning function, which outputs deprecation notices. The wrapper functions invoke other tqdm functions (e.g., _tqdm_notebook, _tnrange). No data is transmitted externally or manipulated in unsafe ways.",
  "flows": "Input arguments to tqdm_notebook and tnrange flow into internal tqdm functions. Warnings are generated based on function calls but do not influence external systems or data flows beyond console output.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The deprecation warnings are standard practice. No dynamic code execution or external data manipulation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of module imports, deprecation warnings, and simple wrapper functions for tqdm features tailored for notebooks. The warnings inform users about deprecated functions. There is no user input handling, no network activity, and no data leaks. The structure and code logic appear typical for a Python library's compatibility and deprecation management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and typical for a library transitioning away from older functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious or harmful operations.",
