{
  "purpose": "This code provides module imports and wrapper functions for a tqdm library, including deprecation warnings and exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules, the tqdm_notebook and tnrange functions that call internal tqdm functions.",
  "sinks": "The warning functions that output deprecation notices, calling internal tqdm functions, and importing modules.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; warnings are emitted when functions are called; wrapper functions pass arguments to internal tqdm functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behavior observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists primarily of straightforward imports, deprecation warnings, and wrapper functions for internal tqdm functionalities. The warning messages advise users about upcoming deprecations, which is standard practice. No user input, environment variables, network connections, or sensitive data handling is present. The functions simply call other internal functions without modifying or inspecting data. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign part of a library's interface, providing backward compatibility and deprecation warnings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
