{
  "purpose": "The code manages module imports, defines deprecated wrapper functions ('tqdm_notebook' and 'tnrange') that issue warnings, and exports various tqdm-related objects for backward compatibility and user notification.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules, functions issuing warnings, and internal tqdm functions.",
  "sinks": "Warning messages printed to the console, internal function calls, no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Calls to deprecated wrapper functions trigger warnings and then invoke internal tqdm functions, with no external data flow or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and standard for library maintenance.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of module imports, two wrapper functions ('tqdm_notebook' and 'tnrange') that issue deprecation warnings and call internal tqdm functions, and an export list. No untrusted data sources, network activity, or malicious code are present. The warnings serve to guide users towards updated APIs. The code is simple, clear, and intended for backward compatibility. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are evident. The deprecation warnings are standard practice and do not pose security risks. Overall, the code is benign, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe component of a Python library handling backward compatibility and user notifications. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The low risk score (~0.1) assigned in previous reports is appropriate, primarily due to deprecation warnings which are benign. Overall, the supply chain security risk for this code snippet is negligible.",
