  "purpose": "Monitoring thread for tqdm progress bars to detect delays and adjust update intervals dynamically, ensuring proper display timing in multi-threaded environments.",
  "sources": "Reads internal tqdm instance attributes such as '_instances', 'last_print_t', 'maxinterval', and 'miniters'.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'refresh(nolock=True)' on tqdm instances to update progress bars; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "flows": "The thread periodically checks tqdm instances, modifies 'miniters' if needed, and invokes 'refresh()' to ensure proper display timing.",
  "anomalies": "Accesses internal tqdm attributes (e.g., '_instances') which are intended for internal use; uses 'del' on instances within a loop, which is unnecessary but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a benign monitoring utility that interacts solely with tqdm's internal attributes to manage progress bar updates. It uses standard threading and cleanup mechanisms without external data flow or network activity. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The use of internal tqdm attributes is a maintenance concern but not security-related. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious logic. Scores assigned as malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate given its benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured progress bar monitor with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low risk scores are justified, and no further action is necessary.",
