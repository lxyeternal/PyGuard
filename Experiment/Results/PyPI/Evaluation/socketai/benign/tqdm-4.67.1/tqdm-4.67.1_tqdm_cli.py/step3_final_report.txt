  "purpose": "A CLI utility for monitoring progress of data streams using tqdm, parsing CLI options, and handling resource files for documentation and completion scripts.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from stdin, CLI options from arguments, resource files for man pages and completion scripts.",
  "sinks": "Outputs processed data to stdout, logs information, and copies resource files to specified directories.",
  "flows": "CLI options are parsed and converted to tqdm parameters; input stream data flows through callbacks and tqdm updates; resource files are copied when specified.",
  "anomalies": "Uses eval() in cast() for interpreting escape sequences (e.g., '\\n'), which could be risky if input is untrusted, but is limited to string escape sequences.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around tqdm for stream progress monitoring. It parses options via regex, handles resource files, and processes input streams with optional callbacks. The eval() in cast() is used solely for interpreting escape sequences in strings, which is a controlled pattern. No network activity, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The use of eval() poses minimal risk given its limited scope, but replacing it with safer alternatives (like codecs.decode) would be advisable for best security practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for stream progress monitoring. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The only minor concern is the eval() in cast(), which is controlled and limited to escape sequences. Overall, the security risk is very low, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscated score is 0. The risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting cautiousness about eval usage but recognizing its controlled context.",
