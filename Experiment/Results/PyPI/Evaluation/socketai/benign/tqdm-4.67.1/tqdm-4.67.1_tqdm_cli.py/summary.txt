  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for stream progress monitoring. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The only minor concern is the eval() in cast(), which is controlled and limited to escape sequences. Overall, the security risk is very low, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscated score is 0. The risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting cautiousness about eval usage but recognizing its controlled context."
