  "purpose": "Issue a deprecation warning to inform users about upcoming removal of certain functions in tqdm==5.0.0 and advise using the updated import paths.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statements and the static warning message.",
  "sinks": "The warning message is static; no untrusted data or external sources are involved, so no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports symbols and then issues a warning, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard import and warning pattern. Use of 'import *' is noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports from a local module and issues a static deprecation warning via warnings.warn(). No user input, external data, or network activity occurs. The purpose is maintenance, and the implementation is standard. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The use of 'import *' is a style concern but not security-related. The warning class and message are static and intended for user notification. Overall, the code is benign, with no evidence of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard deprecation warning mechanism with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.",
