{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to warn users about the deprecation of certain functions or modules in the tqdm package, encouraging migration to newer APIs.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'warn' function from the 'warnings' module and imports from the local '.std' module, including all symbols and a specific warning class.",
  "sinks": "The 'warn' function outputs a warning message; no untrusted input processing is evident. There are no other sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The warning message is generated directly via 'warn', referencing a static string. There are no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard deprecation warning logic; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports warning functionality and a module for standard functions, then issues a deprecation warning to users. All operations involve static data and standard library functions. No external input handling, no suspicious behavior, and no obfuscated code are detected. The purpose is clear and benign: informing users about API deprecation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward deprecation warning mechanism with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious anomalies.",
