  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe code that issues a deprecation warning to users about upcoming removal or change in the tqdm package.\n- The code involves importing from internal modules (.std), importing the warnings module, and calling warn() with a static message.\n- No external or untrusted data sources are involved.\n- The warning messages are straightforward, intended for user notification.\n- No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or obfuscation is present.\n- The use of 'import *' is noted but is a common practice in internal package code, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities.\n- It performs standard deprecation warning procedures.\n- No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are observed.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The use of `from .std import *` is generally discouraged because it can lead to namespace pollution, but this is a common pattern in package internal code and not security-related.\n- The warnings are static and do not process untrusted input, which is appropriate here.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which is correct; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or lower in all reports, which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- All reports assign a **securityRisk** of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The **malware** scores are all 0, which is justified.\n- The **risk** scores are all 0, consistent with the benign assessment.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- No claims or assumptions about vulnerabilities are made in any report.\n- The code is standard for deprecation warnings, with no suspicious or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the provided code and reports, **the overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be**:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:** The code is standard, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The purpose is clear, and the implementation is typical for deprecation notices.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are accurate in their benign assessment.\n- No adjustments needed; scores are appropriate.\n- The code is safe, with no security risks or malware present.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The overall security posture of this code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation. The risk score should remain at 0.",
