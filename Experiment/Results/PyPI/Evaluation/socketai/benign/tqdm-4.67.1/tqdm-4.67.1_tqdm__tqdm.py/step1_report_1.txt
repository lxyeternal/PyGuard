  "purpose": "To issue a deprecation warning to users about an upcoming removal of certain functions or modules in the tqdm package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the current module's standard library import statements and issues a warning with a specific message.",
  "sinks": "The warning function outputs a message to the user; no untrusted data or external inputs are involved.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and then calls warn() to notify users; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code performs standard import and warning functions without any suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports symbols from a local module '.std' and then issues a warning indicating that certain functions will be deprecated in the future. The warning message is straightforward, informing users about future changes and recommending alternative usage. No user input, external data, or risky behavior is present. The code structure and logic are standard for deprecation notices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign deprecation warning implementation with no malicious behavior detected. It simply informs users of future changes in the package. No security risks or malware are present.",
