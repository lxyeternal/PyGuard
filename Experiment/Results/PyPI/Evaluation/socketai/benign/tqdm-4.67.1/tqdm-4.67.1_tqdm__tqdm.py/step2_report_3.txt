  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code performs standard import operations from a local module `.std`.\n   - It issues a warning via `warn()` about upcoming deprecation, advising users to update their import paths.\n   - The warning message is static and straightforward.\n   - No user input, external data, or untrusted sources are involved.\n   - The code uses `import *`, which is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n   - The warning class `TqdmDeprecationWarning` is used appropriately, and `stacklevel=2` helps point the warning to the caller.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code's purpose is to inform users about deprecation, a common and benign practice.\n   - No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.\n   - No data leaks, external network calls, or code obfuscation are present.\n   - The code does not process any untrusted data or perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n3. **Review of Reported Issues and Scores:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as a standard deprecation warning mechanism.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1), and no anomalies or malware are detected.\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - The security risk score is also 0, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The only minor point is the use of `import *`, which is discouraged but not malicious. It does not impact security but could be flagged as a code quality concern.\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, and their assessments are consistent.\n\n5. **Final Justification:**\n   - Given the straightforward purpose, the absence of any suspicious behavior, and the standard practice of issuing deprecation warnings, the malware score should remain at **0**.\n   - The obfuscated score is correctly at **0**.\n   - The risk score should be **0** as well, reflecting no security concern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, benign deprecation warning with no security or malware concerns.",
