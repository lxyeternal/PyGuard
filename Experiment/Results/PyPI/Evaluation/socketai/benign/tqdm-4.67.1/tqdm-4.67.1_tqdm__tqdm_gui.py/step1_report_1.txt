{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to import GUI and standard modules and issue a deprecation warning about a function removal in future versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the current module's .gui and .std submodules, and calls the warn() function from the warnings module.",
  "sinks": "The warn() function outputs a deprecation warning message, which could be viewed by the user, but does not affect data security or integrity.",
  "flows": "Input from the modules (imports), then execution of warn() outputs a message to the user; no untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .gui import *' can be considered risky as it imports all names into the namespace, but it is a common pattern for packages. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard imports and issues a deprecation warning message advising users to switch to a different namespace. It uses relative imports which are common in package code. The warn() message is benign and informational. No suspicious patterns, malicious behavior, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical deprecation warning implementation with module imports. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and intended for package evolution.",
