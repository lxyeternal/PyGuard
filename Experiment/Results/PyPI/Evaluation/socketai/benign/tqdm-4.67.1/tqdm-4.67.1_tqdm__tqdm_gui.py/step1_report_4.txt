{
  "purpose": "To import GUI and standard modules and issue a deprecation warning regarding future removal of certain functions.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'warnings' module, importing from local 'gui' and 'std' modules, and accessing '__all__' from 'gui'.",
  "sinks": "The 'warn' function call, which could potentially log or display warnings.",
  "flows": "Import statements and attribute access (sources) lead to the 'warn' call (sink) to notify users.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; imports and warning issuance are standard. The warning message indicates deprecation, not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'warnings' and local modules 'gui' and 'std', then issues a deprecation warning about a function removal in future versions, instructing users to switch to a different module. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious here. The warning message is straightforward and typical for library deprecation notices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for a library maintaining backward compatibility and notifying users of deprecations. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present.",
