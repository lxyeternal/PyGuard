{
  "purpose": "The code imports GUI components and issues a deprecation warning about a function removal in a future version of the tqdm library.",
  "sources": "The warning message is issued via the warn() function; imported modules (.gui and .std) may contain additional code, but are not directly shown.",
  "sinks": "The warn() function is a standard warning mechanism; no other sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules, then calls warn() with a message, indicating a flow from the import statements to the warning issuance.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior is present. The warning message references a future removal but does not contain malicious instructions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports GUI components and a deprecation warning class, then issues a deprecation warning to inform users about upcoming changes. No user input, network operations, or malicious code is present. The import statements include wildcards, which can sometimes be a concern for namespace pollution, but this is standard practice in some libraries. The warning message is standard for deprecation notices and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a straightforward deprecation warning and module import, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
