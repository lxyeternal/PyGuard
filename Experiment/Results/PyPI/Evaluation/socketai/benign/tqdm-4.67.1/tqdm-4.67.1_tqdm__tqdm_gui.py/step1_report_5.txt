{
  "purpose": "To provide GUI-related functionalities and issue deprecation warnings for outdated usage.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.gui and .std); warning message generation",
  "sinks": "The warning function could be a sink if it logs or outputs data to an untrusted location, but in this context, it appears to be standard output or logs",
  "flows": "Import data flows into the module; the warning message is generated and displayed upon import",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; use of standard warnings and imports; no hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports GUI modules and a deprecation warning class. It issues a warning to users about deprecated usage of internal modules, guiding them toward newer API paths. The use of 'from .gui import *' is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious. The warning message is straightforward and related to API deprecation. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves to maintain backward compatibility and guide users toward updated API usage. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The overall structure is standard for a library deprecation warning.",
