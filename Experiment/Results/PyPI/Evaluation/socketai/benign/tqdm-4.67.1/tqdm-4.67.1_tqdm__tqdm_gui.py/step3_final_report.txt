{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning regarding the removal of certain functions in future versions of tqdm, guiding users to the new namespace.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external or untrusted input; it imports local modules (.gui and .std) and uses a static warning message.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the warnings.warn() function, which outputs an informational message to the user; no data leaks or external effects occur.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply executes static imports and issues a warning.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .gui import *' can cause namespace pollution but is common in internal package code; no obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard internal module imports and issues a deprecation warning, with no external data handling or malicious behavior. The star import is a known pattern in package internals but can lead to namespace pollution. The warning message is static and informational. No code obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are detected. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly zero. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to namespace pollution, which does not constitute a security threat. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with typical deprecation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deprecation warning implementation with internal imports and no malicious or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the security risk is negligible. Minor namespace pollution concerns exist but do not impact security.",
