{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a package that manages deprecated imports and warns users about upcoming removals, likely related to the tqdm library's internal structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the package's own modules (.cli and .std) and calls the warn() function from the warnings module.",
  "sinks": "The warn() function outputs a warning message to the user; no untrusted input or external data is directly involved.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; the warning message is static, and imported modules are internal.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The import statements use NOQA comments to suppress linting warnings, which is common in internal refactoring or deprecation handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules and issues a deprecation warning indicating that a function will be removed in a future version, recommending alternative import paths. The use of 'from .cli import *' and explicit __all__ suggests internal module management. The warning is static and informational, with no indication of malicious intent. No data leakage, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The code adheres to standard deprecation warning practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward deprecation notification mechanism within a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply informs users about upcoming changes and guides them to updated import paths.",
