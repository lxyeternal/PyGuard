  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a deprecation warning mechanism, involving internal module imports and a static warning message.\n- The code pattern is consistent: importing modules (some with wildcard imports), issuing a static warning via `warn()`.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data flows are present.\n- The use of `from .cli import *` and `__all__` is common in package internal code, though not ideal for clarity.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue-by-issue review**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Clear deprecation warning, standard practice.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No untrusted data; static warning.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `import *` is typical in package code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, safe.\n\n**Scores:**\n- *malware:* 0 — correct.\n- *securityRisk:* 0 — appropriate.\n- *obfuscated:* 0 — accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar deprecation notification.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No external data, static warning.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `import *` and `__all__` is noted but not suspicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent; standard deprecation pattern.\n\n**Scores:**\n- *malware:* 0 — appropriate.\n- *securityRisk:* 0.1 — perhaps slightly high; the report notes this, but it's minimal.\n- *obfuscated:* 0 — correct.\n\n**Recommendation:** The security risk score could be lowered to 0, as no real security concern exists.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Deprecation warning.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Static message, no dynamic input.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import noted but common.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**\n- *malware:* 0 — correct.\n- *securityRisk:* 0.1 — perhaps slightly high; no external data or code execution.\n- *obfuscated:* 0 — accurate.\n\n**Recommendation:** Security risk score could be reduced to 0.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Deprecation about internal to public API.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Static warning message.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of wildcard import, but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**\n- *malware:* 0 — appropriate.\n- *securityRisk:* 0 — better reflecting the lack of risk.\n- *obfuscated:* 0 — accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Deprecation warning.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Static message, no dynamic data.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `import *` with suppression comments.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**\n- *malware:* 0 — correct.\n- *securityRisk:* 0.1 — possibly overstated; no external or untrusted data.\n- *obfuscated:* 0 — accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are correctly 0; no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly elevated at 0.1 in some reports. Given the static nature of the code, these should be lowered to 0 to better reflect the absence of security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0** (instead of 0.1 in some reports)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is standard package maintenance code issuing a deprecation warning, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of wildcard imports and suppression comments are common in internal package code and do not constitute security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard. The only adjustment is to reduce the minor security risk scores from 0.1 to 0, aligning with the actual low-risk nature of the code.",
