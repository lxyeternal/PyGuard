{
  "purpose": "Issue a deprecation warning about internal module changes in the tqdm package, guiding users to the new API location.",
  "sources": "Internal module imports (.cli and .std), static warn() call with a fixed message.",
  "sinks": "The warn() function outputs a message to the user; no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "flows": "Import statements and warn() call are static; no dynamic data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .cli import *' and '__all__' is typical in package internal code; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs internal imports and issues a static deprecation warning. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external network activity is present. The wildcard import and suppression comments are common in package maintenance code and do not indicate malicious intent. The warning message is straightforward and hardcoded. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign deprecation notification with internal imports. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior. The scores should be set to malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, reflecting its safe and straightforward purpose.",
