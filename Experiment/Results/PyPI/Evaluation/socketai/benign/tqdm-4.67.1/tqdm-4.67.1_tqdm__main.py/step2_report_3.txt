  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code's purpose is to issue a deprecation warning about internal module changes in the tqdm package.\n- It performs imports from internal modules (.cli and .std) and calls `warn()` with a static message.\n- No dynamic data handling, user input, or external communication is involved.\n- The use of `from .cli import *` and `from .cli import __all__` is common in package internal code, though sometimes discouraged.\n- The warning message is straightforward, static, and explicitly informs users about future removal and API changes.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies the code as a deprecation warning and internal import.\n- **Assessment:** No issues. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0, Confidence = 1.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, correctly describes the code's function.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious behavior; the use of NOQA comments is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.1 (due to import style), Confidence = 0.9.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Focuses on the static warning message and wildcard import.\n- **Assessment:** Wildcard import is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, emphasizes the deprecation warning.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious behavior; standard deprecation pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0, Confidence = 1.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Reiterates the deprecation warning and internal import pattern.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; the use of NOQA and static warning is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; malware score should be **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward; obfuscation score should be **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** The code is standard maintenance/deprecation code, not posing any security risk; overall risk score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis code is a typical deprecation warning with internal module imports, no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and no security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, standard for package maintenance, and does not pose any security threat. The deprecation warning is clear, static, and correctly implemented.",
