  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe a straightforward deprecation warning mechanism, with standard import statements and a static warning message.\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, data handling from untrusted sources, or external communications.\n   - The use of `from .cli import *` and importing `__all__` is typical in package internal management, though it can be considered poor practice but not malicious.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior is detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The main concern could be the use of wildcard imports (`from .cli import *`), which can obscure which components are imported and potentially lead to namespace pollution. However, this is a common pattern in package internal code and not inherently malicious.\n   - The warning message is static and hardcoded, which is standard for deprecation notices.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Security risk scores are very low (~0.1), which is reasonable given the code's purpose.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - Confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), appropriate given the clear, standard pattern.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely for issuing a deprecation warning with internal imports, the risk is minimal.\n   - No dynamic or untrusted data handling, no external network activity, no code obfuscation.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain low (e.g., around 0.1 or lower).\n\n5. **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n   - Malware score is correctly 0; no malicious code or payloads are present.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0; code is clear and readable.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions; all observations are consistent with standard deprecation practices.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores across reports are consistent with the analysis: low malware, low security risk, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard deprecation warning mechanism within a Python package. It performs no malicious actions, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior. The import patterns, while potentially discouraged, are typical in internal package code.**\n\n### My own estimates for the scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Minimal security risk, primarily due to import practices and deprecation warnings, which are standard.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, benign, and intended for maintenance purposes. No security concerns are present.",
