{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning about a function or module that will be removed in a future version of the tqdm package.",
  "sources": "The warning message is generated from a hardcoded string within the warn() function call.",
  "sinks": "The warn() function outputs a warning message to standard error, which can be used by users or scripts to identify deprecated features.",
  "flows": "The hardcoded warning message is sent through warn() to standard error; there are no external inputs or data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes import statements with wildcards ('*') which can obscure which components are imported. No other suspicious or unusual code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from the .cli module and explicitly imports __all__ from it, then imports a specific warning class from .std. It issues a deprecation warning about moving from an internal namespace to a public API. No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, or malicious behaviors are evident. The wildcard import could potentially lead to namespace pollution but is common in package modules. The warning message is static and hardcoded, indicating standard deprecation practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deprecation warning with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The wildcard import might be considered poor practice but does not pose a security threat.",
