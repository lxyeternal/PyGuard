{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to issue a deprecation warning about the removal of a specific function or module in a future version of the tqdm package, and to import certain components from internal modules for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the imported modules (.cli and .std) and from the warn function call, which generates a warning message.",
  "sinks": "The warn function outputs a warning message to the user; no untrusted data handling is evident. No other data sinks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Imported modules are loaded; the warning message is generated and displayed to the user, informing about deprecation. No data flow to external systems or untrusted sources beyond warning output.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .cli import *' and importing __all__ may suggest internal module exposure, but this is common in package code. No suspicious or unusual code behavior, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and components, then issues a deprecation warning about future removal of a function. The warning message is straightforward and informs users to switch to a new namespace. No suspicious patterns, malicious behavior, or security issues are detected. The code performs typical package maintenance activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard deprecation warning with imports for package functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is safe and intended for deprecation notification purposes.",
