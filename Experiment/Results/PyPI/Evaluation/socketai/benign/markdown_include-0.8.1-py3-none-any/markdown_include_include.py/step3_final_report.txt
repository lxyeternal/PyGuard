  "purpose": "Provides a Markdown extension to include external file contents using a custom syntax '{!filename!}', allowing recursive inclusion and line range selection.",
  "sources": "Reads filenames from Markdown content, expands user directories, and opens files for reading.",
  "sinks": "Inserts file contents into Markdown lines; potential for local file disclosure if filenames are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Markdown line containing '{!filename!}' triggers filename expansion, file reading, and content insertion into the output lines.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors; lacks cycle detection for recursive includes; does not validate filenames.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward file inclusion mechanism with path expansion and error handling. It processes Markdown lines, searches for include syntax, reads specified files or line ranges, and inserts content. No network activity, code execution, or obfuscation is present. The primary security concern is the potential for local file disclosure if filenames are controlled by an attacker, which is inherent to such inclusion features. The code does not sanitize filenames, but this is typical for inclusion utilities. No malicious patterns or backdoors are detected. The scores reflect low malware risk (0), no obfuscation (0), and a modest security risk (0.2) due to potential misuse.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Markdown extension facilitating file inclusion. Its main security concern is the potential for local file disclosure if filenames are untrusted, but it does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with its functionality.",
