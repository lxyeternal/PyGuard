  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources, environment variables, network connections, file reads/writes, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file output, environment variable access, dynamic eval/exec calls.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables flow into functions like eval/exec or network modules, potentially leading to data exfiltration or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded strings resembling credentials, complex logic, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code shows minimal or no suspicious activity, with benign patterns in most reports. Report 4 indicates obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion but lacking concrete malicious actions. Scores are consistent with the described behaviors: low malware and obfuscation in benign reports, moderate suspicion in report 4. No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. The confidence levels align with the evidence, and no false positives are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk. Report 4's obfuscation and dynamic features justify moderate suspicion, but without explicit malicious actions, overall risk remains low. The scores are justified and consistent with the observations.",
