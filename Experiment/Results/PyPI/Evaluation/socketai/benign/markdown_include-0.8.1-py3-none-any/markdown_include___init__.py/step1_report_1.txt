  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no immediately visible malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters or possibly external files (not explicitly shown), but no specific input sources are identified in the visible code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file writes, or system commands, but none are explicitly present in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flows are observable within the provided code segment.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, obfuscated parts, or unusual constructs. No backdoors, suspicious API calls, or malicious code behaviors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical utility or processing script with standard functions. No signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious activity are evident. The structure and syntax are consistent with normal Python practices. Due to the lack of external or hidden behaviors, no anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code looks benign and safe for use.",
