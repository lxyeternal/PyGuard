  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward implementation for managing Cloud Run resources via GCP API, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified given its API client nature. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to zero. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use."
