  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward version declaration, generated by setuptools-scm.\n- The code contains no dynamic behavior, no external input handling, no network activity, and no obfuscation.\n- The use of conditional type checking (`TYPE_CHECKING`) is standard and does not introduce any security concern.\n- All version variables are assigned static, hardcoded values.\n- No suspicious patterns, hidden code, or malicious behavior are identified.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious or suspicious code:**\n   - None of the reports find any malicious or obfuscated code.\n   - The code is a typical pattern for version management in Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors or flaws in reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and their justification:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 0.5 at most.\n   - Given the analysis, these scores are appropriate.\n   - The risk scores are justified as zero because the code is benign.\n\n4. **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as harmless.\n\n5. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores align well with the code's nature and the analysis.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, generated version declaration module with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should all be **0**.\n- The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as all reports concur.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, non-malicious, and poses no supply chain security threat.",
