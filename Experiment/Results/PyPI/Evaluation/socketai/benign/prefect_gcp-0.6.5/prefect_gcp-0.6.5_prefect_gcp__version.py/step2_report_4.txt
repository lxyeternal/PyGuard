  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and compare it with the provided code to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward version declaration module, generated by setuptools-scm.\n- It assigns static version information ('0.6.5') to various variables.\n- The conditional TYPE_CHECKING block is standard for type hints and does not involve external input or dynamic behavior.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Assessment of the Reports:**\n\n1. **Purpose & Sources:** All reports correctly identify the purpose as defining version info, with sources being static assignments and type checking imports.\n2. **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or data flows from external sources are present in any report, which aligns with the code.\n3. **Anomalies & Analysis:** All reports note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. They correctly interpret the code as standard for version management.\n4. **Conclusions & Confidence:** All reports conclude the code is benign, with high confidence, which is accurate.\n\n**Scores & Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct. There is no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of external inputs or dynamic behavior.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n\n- The reports are uniformly consistent and accurate.\n- No report overstates or understates the risk.\n- The code does not warrant a higher risk score because it is static, well-understood, and generated by a reputable tool.\n\n**Final Expert Judgment:**\n\nGiven the evidence, I concur with the assessments that this code is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the actual code behavior.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard version declaration file with no security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
