{
  "purpose": "This code defines version-related metadata for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, to manage versioning information.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, setting module attributes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment of version variables without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints is standard; no unusual code patterns or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes version metadata variables for the package, with conditional type hints. All version data are hardcoded as static strings or tuples. There are no inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The structure and content are typical for a generated version module and do not contain malicious code or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe version metadata module generated by setuptools-scm. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
