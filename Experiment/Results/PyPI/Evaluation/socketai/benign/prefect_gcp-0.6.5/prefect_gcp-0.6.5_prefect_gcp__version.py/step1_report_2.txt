{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, including version strings and tuples.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to outputs; the code only sets predefined variables.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets beyond version info, which is typical and harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares version-related variables, with no external input handling, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or other suspicious behavior. The presence of TYPE_CHECKING block is standard for type hints and does not introduce security risks. The variables are assigned static version info, typical for a package's version file. No potential attack vectors or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves a purely informational purpose and contains no suspicious or malicious code.",
