  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, static version declaration module generated by setuptools-scm.\n- They correctly identify that the code does not process untrusted data, perform dynamic operations, or contain malicious patterns.\n- The code is simple, with no obfuscation, external input, or network activity.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - The code assigns static version strings and tuples.\n   - Conditional type hints via `TYPE_CHECKING` are standard practice.\n   - No dynamic code, external data, or obfuscated patterns are present.\n   - No suspicious or malicious constructs are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are apparent.\n   - The code adheres to common version declaration patterns.\n   - No issues with the scores assigned.\n\n3. **Score Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score (0):** Correct, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score (0):** Correct, code is straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score (0):** Appropriate, as no security risks are identified.\n\n4. **Claims about Vulnerabilities:**\n   - All reports correctly dismiss any vulnerabilities, assuming static version info.\n   - No assumptions are unjustified; the code's purpose is clear and benign.\n\n5. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable score assignments.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nGiven the thorough review, **all reports are accurate** in their analysis and scoring. The code is a standard version declaration module with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are correct, and the code poses no security concerns. The scores reflect the benign nature of this versioning snippet accurately.",
