  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string from hardcoded assignments and conditional type annotations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The version string is assigned directly to variables, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only handles static version information.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up versioning variables using static assignments, with conditional typing support. It avoids dynamic or untrusted data sources, and there are no signs of malicious behavior. The code is minimal, with no external input handling or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version info module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
