  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency, accuracy, and to identify any overlooked issues.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward version declaration module, with static assignments and no external data handling.\n- The code uses standard practices, including conditional type checking, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n- The version string is hardcoded as `'0.6.5'`, with corresponding tuple `(0, 6, 5)`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the issues in the code:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is a static, benign version declaration with no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n\n- **Are there any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The code is simple, correct, and follows standard conventions. No flaws are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is correct. The code is transparent and straightforward.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is justified given the static nature and lack of external inputs.\n\n- **Confidence scores:**  \n  All are `1`, reflecting high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n- **Any need for score adjustments?**  \n  No. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Potential assumptions and claims:\n\n- The reports do not assume any malicious intent beyond static version declaration, which is appropriate.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are made, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\nGiven the thorough analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is standard, benign, and poses no security threat.\n\n**Final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Note:** No changes needed. The code is safe, and the reports are accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical version declaration module with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate.",
