  "purpose": "Define versioning information for a package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and version tuples; type checking imports (conditionally imported).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment of version data with no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hidden code, or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard version declaration practices.",
  "analysis": "The code declares version-related variables for a Python package, assigning static version information ('0.6.5') and defining related tuple structures. Conditional type checking is used but does not involve external input or dynamic execution. No data is read from external sources, and no malicious or suspicious code is present. The code is typical for version management and contains no obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious version declaration module, with no indicators of malicious intent, supply chain risks, or security concerns.",
