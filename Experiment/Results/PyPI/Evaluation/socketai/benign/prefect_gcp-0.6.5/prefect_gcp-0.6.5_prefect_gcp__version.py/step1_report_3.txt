{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm, primarily used for package versioning.",
  "sources": "Constants defining version strings and tuples, with no input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; the code only assigns static values.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code contains straightforward version assignments with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes version-related variables, including __version__, version, __version_tuple__, and version_tuple, with hardcoded values. It includes type checking conditions but ultimately assigns static version information. There are no input reads, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The structure is simple and standard for version definition files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version definition module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
