{
  "purpose": "This code imports various modules and classes related to Google Cloud services and assigns a version number, serving as an initialization or entry point for a larger package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (_version, bigquery, cloud_storage, credentials, secret_manager, workers.vertex, workers.cloud_run, workers.cloud_run_v2). No external input data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of __version__ and import statements; no sinks or data output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; import statements are static and do not involve data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected. The code consists solely of imports and a version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a module initializer, importing various components related to Google Cloud services and defining a version variable. All import statements are static and standard, with no signs of dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious code. No input handling, network communication, or data processing occurs here. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or main module file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning solely to import components and set a version. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The overall security risk score is very low.",
