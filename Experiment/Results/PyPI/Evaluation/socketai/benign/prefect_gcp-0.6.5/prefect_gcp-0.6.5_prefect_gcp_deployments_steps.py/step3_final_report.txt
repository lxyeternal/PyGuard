{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to upload and download files between local storage and Google Cloud Storage within Prefect workflows, with credential management and ignore pattern filtering.",
  "sources": "Reads local files from current working directory; reads ignore patterns from a file; reads credentials from provided dictionary or environment.",
  "sinks": "Uploads files to GCS bucket; downloads blobs from GCS to local directory.",
  "flows": "Local file paths are relative to current directory; files are uploaded or downloaded via SDK methods; ignore patterns filter files during upload.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Google Cloud SDK functions for file transfer, with proper credential handling via service account info, file, or default credentials. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. Credential management is secure, and file operations are straightforward. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are evident. The ignore pattern filtering is standard. Overall, the implementation aligns with best practices for secure cloud storage interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for GCS file transfer within Prefect, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
