  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for data processing and possibly network communication, but without specific context, its precise intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, or data received from network connections.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data outputs, network requests, or file writes.",
  "flows": "Data may flow from input sources through processing functions to output sinks or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual language features detected. The code structure appears standard, but lacks comments or documentation which could obscure intent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with typical import statements and standard function definitions. No suspicious external connections, obfuscated strings, or dynamic code execution are present. The usage of third-party libraries is normal. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are evident. The control flow is straightforward, with no apparent attempts to hide or mislead. Data handling appears standard, with no obvious injection points or insecure practices. The overall pattern suggests a benign data processing script, but without full context or runtime behavior, cannot confirm complete safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no clear signs of malicious behavior or malware. It seems to be a normal data processing or communication script with no suspicious elements identified based on the static analysis. Confidence is high that the code is safe, and there are no obfuscation or malware indicators.",
