{
  "purpose": "This code manages Google Cloud Platform's Secret Manager secrets, allowing creation, reading, updating, and deletion of secrets via asynchronous tasks and a custom SecretBlock class.",
  "sources": "Inputs come from function parameters such as secret names, values, credentials, and configuration options. External dependencies (e.g., gcp_credentials) are used to get clients and project info.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to Google Cloud Secret Manager via API calls, including secret payloads. Secrets are stored in GCP, and secret data can be read and written securely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters through API request objects to GCP secret manager client methods. Secret data is sent in payloads; secret names and versions are used to locate resources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code includes standard API interactions with GCP secrets. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard SDK and API patterns to interact with GCP Secret Manager. It includes methods for secret lifecycle management, employing async operations with thread pools for I/O. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft observed. Usage of external libraries appears normal for this context. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures detected. All data flows are consistent with typical secret management workflows. The code's primary purpose is secure secret handling, with no evident malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate secret management functionality with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It correctly interfaces with GCP Secret Manager, and no malicious signals are present.",
