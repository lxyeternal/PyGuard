  "purpose": "Defines a pytest fixture that returns a Path object pointing to a 'roots' directory relative to the current script's location.",
  "sources": "The special variable __file__ which provides the current script's filename.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data transmission.",
  "flows": "The code resolves __file__ to an absolute path and appends 'roots' to it, creating a directory Path object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and follows standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines a fixture that computes a directory path based on __file__, and returns it. There are no network operations, data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is typical for setting up test environments. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test fixture setup with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
