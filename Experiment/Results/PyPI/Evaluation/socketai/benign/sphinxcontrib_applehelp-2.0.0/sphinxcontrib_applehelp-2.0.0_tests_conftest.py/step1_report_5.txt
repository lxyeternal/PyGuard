  "purpose": "Setup configuration for pytest testing framework, specifically defining a fixture to locate the 'roots' directory.",
  "sources": "The code reads the special variable __file__ to determine the current script's location.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink is present; the code does not write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "The source (__file__) flows into Path().resolve() which is used to determine an absolute path, then appends 'roots'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard setup tasks without any unusual behavior or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for compatibility, uses pathlib to resolve file paths, and sets a pytest fixture to define a directory path. There is no suspicious or malicious activity observed. No external data inputs or outputs beyond standard path resolution are involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for testing purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
