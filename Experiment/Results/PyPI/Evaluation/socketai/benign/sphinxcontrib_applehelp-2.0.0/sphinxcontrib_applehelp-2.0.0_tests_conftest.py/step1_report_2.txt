  "purpose": "The code sets up a test environment using pytest, defining a fixture for the root directory path.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __file__ attribute to determine the current script's location.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The source (__file__) flows into the Path resolution to determine the root directory for tests.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is straightforward test setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, specifies pytest plugins, and defines a fixture that computes a directory path relative to the current file. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. It appears to be standard test configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup for pytest testing environment, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
