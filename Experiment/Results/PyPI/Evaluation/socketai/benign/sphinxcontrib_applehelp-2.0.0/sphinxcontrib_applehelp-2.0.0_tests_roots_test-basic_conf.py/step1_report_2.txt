  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file system writes, or execution of dynamic code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/env variables) to sinks (outputs, network, or dynamic execution).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious hardcoded secrets detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed. No clear malicious backdoors or malicious network activity evident.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly, including beginning, middle, and end. No suspicious or malicious code segments such as hidden backdoors, system damage commands, or data exfiltration routines were identified. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No suspicious network activity or dynamic code execution detected. No anomalies in coding patterns that suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.",
