{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and data flow anomalies, ensuring supply chain security.",
  "sources": "Input data from untrusted sources such as user inputs, environment variables, network data, or external files.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or security-impacting actions such as network transmission, system commands execution, file modifications, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., system commands, network calls) potentially leading to security issues if untrusted data is not validated.",
  "anomalies": "Unvalidated input usage, potential data flow into system commands, or unprotected network communications; code that performs dynamic execution without validation; any hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns detected. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. Potential concerns include unvalidated input that could lead to security issues, but no active exploitation or malicious intent is evident. The confidence in benign assessment is high (0.8-0.9). No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious data flows are identified. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a conservative security risk score around 0.1-0.2, reflecting potential vulnerabilities but no active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. Minor security concerns related to unvalidated input are acknowledged but do not constitute active threats. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating a low security risk and no malware presence.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
