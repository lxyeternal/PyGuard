  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build extension for Apple help books, with no malicious intent or payloads. The main security concern is reliance on environment variables and external tools, which could be exploited if environment is compromised, but this is standard for such build scripts. Scores should reflect low malware risk and minimal obfuscation, with a slight increase in security risk due to external command reliance."
