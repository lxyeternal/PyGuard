  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, dependency-free cryptographic utility for handling secp256k1 EC private keys. It performs expected operations securely and correctly, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate and justified."
