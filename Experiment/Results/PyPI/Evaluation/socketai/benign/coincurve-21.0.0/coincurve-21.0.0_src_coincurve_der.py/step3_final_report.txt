  "purpose": "ASN.1 DER encoder/decoder for secp256k1 EC private keys, supporting PKCS#8 and RFC 5915 structures.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'private_key', 'public_key', and 'der_data' processed in-memory; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Processed data returned as bytes; no external communication or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through encoding/decoding functions, validating ASN.1 structure, and extracting or constructing key data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; reliance on standard ASN.1 tags and OIDs.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements ASN.1 DER encoding and decoding for secp256k1 EC private keys, adhering to standards. Validation steps ensure structure integrity. No external I/O, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. The implementation is straightforward, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, dependency-free cryptographic utility for handling secp256k1 EC private keys. It performs expected operations securely and correctly, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate and justified.",
