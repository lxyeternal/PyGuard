{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to encode and decode secp256k1 EC private keys in DER format, supporting PKCS#8 structure for key serialization and deserialization.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'private_key' and optional 'public_key' parameters for encoding; the 'der_data' input for decoding.",
  "sinks": "The decoding function outputs the private key bytes; there are no sinks that send data elsewhere, but the code processes cryptographic key material.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (private_key, public_key, der_data) through encoding/decoding functions, transforming key bytes without external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs standard DER encoding/decoding of cryptographic keys. No network, file I/O, or external process execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically encodes and decodes cryptographic key structures using DER standards, with clear, standard cryptographic data handling. Functions for length encoding, octet string, and bit string encoding follow typical ASN.1 DER conventions. The decoding process validates structure, extracts key material, and ensures the key belongs to the secp256k1 curve. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as hidden network activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. Usage of well-known cryptographic utilities from 'coincurve.utils' appears safe and standard. Overall, the code performs standard cryptographic data processing without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of DER encoding and decoding for secp256k1 EC private keys, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It adheres to standard cryptographic practices and ASN.1 DER formatting. There are no external threats or malicious payloads embedded.",
