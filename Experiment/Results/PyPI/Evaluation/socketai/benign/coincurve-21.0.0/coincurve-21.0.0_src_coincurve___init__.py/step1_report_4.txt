{
  "purpose": "To export specific classes and functions from the coincurve library for use in cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load modules and functions from the coincurve library.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external outputs, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. The version string is standard, and the exports are typical for a module.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific components from the coincurve library and defines an __all__ list for module exports. No user input, external data, or potential attack vectors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward module initialization and export statement, typical in Python packages. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as an interface to the coincurve library's cryptographic functions and classes.",
