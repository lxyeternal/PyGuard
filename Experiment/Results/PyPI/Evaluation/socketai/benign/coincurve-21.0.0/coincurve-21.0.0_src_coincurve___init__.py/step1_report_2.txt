{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions and classes from the 'coincurve' library and defines the module's public interface and version.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'coincurve.context', 'coincurve.keys', and 'coincurve.utils'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code only defines exports and version info.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward import statements and module-level variable definitions. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execute any untrusted code. All imported modules are from the 'coincurve' package, which is a well-known cryptographic library for secp256k1 elliptic curve operations. There are no signs of malicious activity or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization script that imports and exposes certain cryptographic functions and classes. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
