{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes and functions from the 'coincurve' library and defines the module's public API along with a version identifier.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'coincurve' modules: coincurve.context, coincurve.keys, coincurve.utils",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data handling occurs; the code only imports and defines an export list",
  "flows": "The imported modules provide cryptographic functionality; no untrusted data flows are present in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a version declaration, followed by an export list. It imports cryptographic classes and functions from a well-known library 'coincurve'. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are accessed or manipulated. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to set up an interface for cryptographic operations, which is common in security-related modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import and export setup for a cryptographic library module. No malicious behavior or security risks are present in this snippet.",
