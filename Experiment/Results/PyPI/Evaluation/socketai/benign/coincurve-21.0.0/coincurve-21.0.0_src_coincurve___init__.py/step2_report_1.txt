  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the details within each.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes and functions from the 'coincurve' library and re-exports them via `__all__`. It also defines a version string. There are no operations, data processing, or dynamic behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is a benign module setup with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with a slight mention of a `securityRisk` of 0.1, which seems arbitrary given the code's simplicity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 1\n- **Verdict:** The security risk score of 0.1 appears unwarranted since the code is purely import/export without any suspicious behavior. I would suggest lowering it to 0 for consistency.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states the code is a standard re-export module with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Correct, no signs of malicious activity, just import/export.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, straightforward import/export with no issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is a simple module setup.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** Slight inconsistency in Report 2 (0.1). Given the code's simplicity, the risk should be 0.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks present.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n- The import statements are from a well-known cryptographic library.\n- The code appears to be a standard module for exposing cryptographic functions.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                      |\n| Security Risk  | 0                      |\n\nThis aligns with the observed code and the detailed analysis.",
