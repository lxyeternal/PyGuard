  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**1. Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code imports cryptographic components and exposes them via `__all__`.  \n- **Findings:** No data flow, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, no secrets.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a straightforward module setup. No issues here.\n\n**2. Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, with slight variation in securityRisk (0.1).  \n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no data flow, no secrets.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the benign analysis.  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly identified as safe. The small securityRisk score seems reasonable, but not indicative of any real concern.\n\n**3. Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Re-exporting components from `coincurve`.  \n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no data flow, no secrets.  \n- **Scores:** Both 0, consistent with the analysis.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid. No issues.\n\n**4. Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard module setup.  \n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no secrets, no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Both 0, appropriate.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**5. Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Same as others—import and export pattern.  \n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no data flow, no secrets.  \n- **Scores:** Both 0, consistent.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is just a module setup with imports and exports.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is justified given the benign nature.  \n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher (0.1) in one report, but still very low and justifiable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable across all reports.  \n- No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks in the provided code snippet.  \n- The reports correctly interpret the code as a standard, safe module setup.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, perhaps due to the nature of re-exporting cryptographic functions, but not a security concern)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, standard module boilerplate, with no signs of security issues or malware.",
