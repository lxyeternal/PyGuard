  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific classes and functions from the coincurve library for use in other modules or projects.",
  "sources": "Imports from the coincurve library: coincurve.context, coincurve.keys, coincurve.utils",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data is processed or transmitted",
  "flows": "N/A – only imports and exports are defined, with no data flow or execution logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors observed; the code simply re-exports library components",
  "analysis": "The code imports several components from the coincurve cryptography library and defines __version__ and __all__ for module exports. No dynamic execution, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns are present. It functions as a straightforward module to expose selected parts of coincurve for external use.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for re-exporting library components with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
