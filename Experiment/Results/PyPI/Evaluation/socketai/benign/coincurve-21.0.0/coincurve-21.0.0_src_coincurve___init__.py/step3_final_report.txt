{
  "purpose": "This code module imports specific cryptographic classes and functions from the 'coincurve' library and re-exports them for external use, serving as an interface or wrapper.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'coincurve' library modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks, no network operations, no execution of untrusted code",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flows or dynamic execution paths present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports and re-exports specific classes and functions from a well-known cryptographic library. It defines a version string and an explicit __all__ list, indicating intended public API. There are no data processing, no input handling, no network communication, and no dynamic code execution. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The security posture is benign, with no vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup for exposing cryptographic functionalities. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal security risk score should be 0, and malware likelihood is effectively zero.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
