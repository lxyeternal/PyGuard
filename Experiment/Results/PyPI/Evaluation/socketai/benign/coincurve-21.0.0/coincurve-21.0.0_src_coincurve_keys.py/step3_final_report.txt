  "purpose": "Implementation of secp256k1 elliptic curve cryptography functions including key management, signing (ECDSA and Schnorr), verification, key tweaking, and ECDH, relying on the libsecp256k1 library.",
  "sources": "Input data includes private secrets, public keys, messages, signatures, and randomness sources such as os.urandom.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include signatures, shared secrets, serialized keys, and verification results. No external data exfiltration or network activity is present.",
  "flows": "Standard cryptographic data flows from input validation, through cryptographic operations, to output generation. No suspicious or malicious data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious code constructs, or backdoors are detected. Use of os.urandom for auxiliary randomness is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of secp256k1 cryptography. It performs proper input validation, uses established cryptographic libraries, and handles errors appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security sabotage are present. The cryptographic functions are correctly used, and the code aligns with best practices. The consistent low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and low security risk (~0.2) across reports reflect this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure cryptographic library implementing standard secp256k1 operations. There is no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
