  "purpose": "Implementation of cryptographic key handling, signing, verification, and key manipulation functions for elliptic curve cryptography using secp256k1.",
  "sources": "Input data includes secret keys, public keys, messages, signatures, and various data passed into cryptographic functions; derived from parameters and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include signatures, public key formats, and shared secrets; cryptographic functions and serialization functions may process untrusted data. Public key serialization, signature verification, and shared secret computation are key sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (secrets, messages, public keys) through validation and cryptographic functions, leading to outputs such as signatures, serialized keys, or shared secrets. Public keys are derived or combined; signatures are generated and verified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns identified. Use of os.urandom for auxiliary randomness is standard. No obfuscated or unusual language features. Functions appear to be standard cryptographic operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard cryptographic key generation, signing, verification, and key manipulation functionalities, with appropriate input validation and error handling. It uses established cryptographic library functions with proper checks for success. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or privacy leaks are detected. All cryptographic operations rely on external libraries (libsecp256k1), and there is no evidence of data exfiltration or backdoors. The structure and methods follow standard cryptographic practices. No hardcoded secrets, unsafe data handling, or other malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard cryptographic implementation for elliptic curve key operations, signing, and verification. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected. It is consistent with typical use of libsecp256k1 and proper validation practices. The code is well-structured, with no evident security risks or malware indications.",
