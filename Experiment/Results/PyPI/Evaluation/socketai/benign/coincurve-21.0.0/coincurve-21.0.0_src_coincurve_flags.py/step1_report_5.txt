{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize constants and import functions related to elliptic curve cryptography, likely for cryptographic operations or key management.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ and coincurve._libsecp256k1 library; the lib object providing constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data processing or external output functions are included.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable within this snippet; just variable assignments and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are evident. The code is limited to defining constants and importing functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific library for secp256k1 elliptic curve cryptography, defines some context flags, and notes additional available flags in comments. It does not include data processing, network operations, or any external data handling. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code behavior. The code appears to be part of a cryptographic utility or module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign setup for cryptographic operations, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided content.",
