  "purpose": "Initialize constants and flags for elliptic curve cryptography using the secp256k1 library.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from __future__ and from coincurve._libsecp256k1 import lib",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code simply sets constants",
  "anomalies": "Code only defines constants and imports; no suspicious or unusual behavior or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports the secp256k1 library and defines some constants related to elliptic curve cryptography. It uses the lib object from coincurve._libsecp256k1 to assign context and flag values. No data input/output, no dynamic execution, and no malicious patterns are present. It appears to be standard setup code for cryptographic operations without any obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for cryptographic operations, defining constants for secp256k1. No malicious intent or suspicious activity is detected. It is benign configuration code for cryptography library initialization.",
