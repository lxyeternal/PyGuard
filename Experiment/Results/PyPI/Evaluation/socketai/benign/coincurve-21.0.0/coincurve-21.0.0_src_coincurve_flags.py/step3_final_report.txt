  "purpose": "Initialization of cryptographic constants and flags for secp256k1 elliptic curve operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ and coincurve._libsecp256k1.lib, accessing internal library constants.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Constant assignments from internal library attributes to local variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal, potentially undocumented constants from the secp256k1 library; no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup segment importing internal constants from the secp256k1 library via coincurve, defining context and key format flags. It contains no data flow, cryptographic operations, or network activity. The use of internal constants is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be part of a cryptographic configuration or initialization routine, with benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as cryptographic setup with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The use of internal constants does not indicate malicious intent. All signals point to a standard, safe configuration snippet.",
