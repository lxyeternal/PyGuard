{
  "purpose": "The code initializes constants and flags for cryptographic operations using the secp256k1 elliptic curve library, likely for key generation, signing, or verification in a cryptographic application.",
  "sources": "Import from __future__ for compatibility; import of libsecp256k1 library for cryptographic constants.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no external data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink observed in the provided code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward setup for cryptographic operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for compatibility, then loads specific constants from the secp256k1 cryptographic library. It defines context flags and elliptic curve compression flags using the library's constants. No user input handling, network communication, or data processing occurs in this fragment. The code appears to serve as setup or configuration for subsequent cryptographic operations, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment appears to be a benign setup for cryptographic operations, defining constants from a well-known library without any malicious intent or security risks.",
