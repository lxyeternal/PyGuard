  "purpose": "Cryptographic benchmarking of 'coincurve' and 'fastecdsa' libraries, measuring key generation, signing, verification, and key export/import performance.",
  "sources": "os.urandom() for MESSAGE; library imports; cryptographic function calls",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external transmissions; internal computations only",
  "flows": "MESSAGE generated by os.urandom() -> used in sign/verify functions; library functions perform cryptographic operations internally",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns; code is straightforward and well-structured",
  "analysis": "The code performs cryptographic benchmarking using standard libraries with secure randomness; no external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present; it uses cryptographically secure functions appropriately; no obfuscation or suspicious constructs are detected; scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate cryptographic benchmarking utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses secure practices and performs internal computations only. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.",
