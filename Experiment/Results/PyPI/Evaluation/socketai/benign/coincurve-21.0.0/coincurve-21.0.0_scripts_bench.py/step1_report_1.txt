{
  "purpose": "This script benchmarks cryptographic libraries (coincurve and fastecdsa) for key generation, signing, verification, key export, and import operations, and displays the results in a live table.",
  "sources": "os.urandom() for MESSAGE, os, sys, time, timeit modules, and library imports (coincurve, fastecdsa).",
  "sinks": "os.urandom() generates high-entropy random data; no data sinks are present that transmit or store untrusted data externally.",
  "flows": "MESSAGE generated at the start; used in cryptographic operations for signing and verification; data flow is internal and used for benchmarking purposes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.urandom() for MESSAGE suggests intent to generate secure random message data. No suspicious or malicious code execution detected; the code primarily benchmarks cryptographic functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports cryptography libraries and performs cryptographic operations (key generation, signing, verification, key export/import). MESSAGE is initialized with os.urandom() for randomness, which is standard for cryptographic testing. Benchmarking is done via timeit.Timer, and results are displayed in a dynamic table. No external data transmission, hidden code, or malicious behavior is observed. The script is a straightforward benchmarking tool with no evident malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign benchmarking utility for cryptographic libraries, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses secure random data for testing purposes and performs standard cryptographic operations without external data exfiltration or malicious payloads.",
