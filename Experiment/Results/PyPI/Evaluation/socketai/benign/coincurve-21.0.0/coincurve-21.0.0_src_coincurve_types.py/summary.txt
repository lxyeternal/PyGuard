  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign setup for cryptographic type annotations with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: approximately 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature."
