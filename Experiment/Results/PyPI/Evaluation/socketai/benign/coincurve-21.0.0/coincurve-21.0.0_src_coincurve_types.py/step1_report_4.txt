  "purpose": "Define type aliases for cryptographic hashing and nonce data structures used in secp256k1 elliptic curve cryptography.",
  "sources": "No data input or data reading operations are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is observable in this isolated code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports a C library (_libsecp256k1) and defines type aliases without any suspicious or unusual operations. The use of 'ffi.CData' suggests interaction with C-level data structures, which is typical in cryptographic libraries but warrants caution if used improperly. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type aliases for a cryptographic hash function and a nonce, involving the 'coincurve' library's FFI interface with a secp256k1 C library. The imports and definitions are standard for cryptographic implementations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions. The code appears to be part of a cryptographic module for secure operations. No dangerous patterns or anomalies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup for cryptographic data types and imports a cryptographic library. There is no malicious intent detected, and the code does not pose security risks on its own. It appears benign, assuming it is used as intended within cryptographic operations.",
