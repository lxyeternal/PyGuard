{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define type aliases for cryptographic functions and data types related to secp256k1 operations, likely used in a cryptographic context such as blockchain or digital signatures.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, untrusted data handling, or security-sensitive operations are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable, as the code only contains type alias definitions and import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports a low-level cryptography library 'coincurve._libsecp256k1' but does not perform any operations, which alone is not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for type hinting, imports a standard collection module, and imports a specific cryptographic library's internal ffi object. It defines 'Hasher' as a nullable callable that takes bytes and returns bytes, and 'Nonce' as a tuple of ffi.CData types. These definitions are typical for cryptographic utility modules and do not suggest malicious intent. No code execution, data handling, or network communication is present that could indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment only contains type alias definitions and safe import statements related to cryptographic operations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
