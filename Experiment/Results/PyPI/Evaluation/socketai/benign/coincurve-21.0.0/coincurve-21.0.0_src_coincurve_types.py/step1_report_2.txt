  "purpose": "Define type aliases for cryptographic hashing functions and nonce tuples related to secp256k1 curve operations.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs or untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as there are no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'from __future__' import, which is standard; imports from 'coincurve' library, which is a well-known cryptography library. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations, collections for Callable, and a specific module from coincurve's internal libsecp256k1 binding. It then defines type aliases 'Hasher' as an optional callable taking bytes and returning bytes, and 'Nonce' as a tuple of CData objects from ffi. The code appears to be establishing type annotations for cryptographic operations, with no active logic, data handling, or potential malicious activity present.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a straightforward setup for cryptographic function typing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, preparatory piece of code for further cryptographic implementation.",
