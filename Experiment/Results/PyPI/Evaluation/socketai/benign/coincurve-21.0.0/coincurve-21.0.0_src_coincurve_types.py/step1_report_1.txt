{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define type aliases for cryptographic functions and data structures related to secp256k1 elliptic curve cryptography.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'ffi' from 'coincurve._libsecp256k1' indicates direct interfacing with low-level C library functions; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for type hinting, imports 'Callable' for type aliasing, and references 'ffi' from a specific cryptographic library. It defines 'Hasher' as an optional callable that takes bytes and returns bytes, and 'Nonce' as a tuple of C data objects. No external input, no processing, and no malicious code are evident. This is a typical setup for cryptographic operations, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type alias setup for cryptographic functions, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is a safe and typical part of a larger cryptographic library.",
