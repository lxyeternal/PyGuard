  "purpose": "Define type aliases for cryptographic functions and data structures interacting with low-level C data via ffi.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially 'ffi' from 'coincurve._libsecp256k1', and the type alias definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or handle untrusted data or perform any I/O.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only type aliasing and imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard cryptographic setup with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and type alias definitions for cryptographic functions, referencing low-level C data structures via ffi. There are no functions, data processing, or logic that could be malicious. The use of 'ffi.CData' is typical in cryptographic bindings but does not imply malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is benign and serves as a setup or interface layer for cryptographic operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign setup for cryptographic type annotations with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: approximately 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
