  "purpose": "Define type aliases for cryptographic hash functions and nonces used in secp256k1 operations",
  "sources": "Import statements: __future__.annotations, collections.abc.Callable, coincurve._libsecp256k1.ffi",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in the provided code",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as the code only defines types and imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward type alias definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for forward references, defines a type alias 'Hasher' for a callable that takes bytes and returns bytes or None, and 'Nonce' as a tuple of ffi.CData objects from the secp256k1 library. These are standard definitions related to cryptographic operations, with no signs of malicious behavior or hidden functionality. No input reading, data handling, or executable logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple, safe type alias and import setup for cryptographic operations involving secp256k1. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks in this code segment.",
