  "purpose": "Cryptographic utility functions for key handling, signature verification, encoding/decoding, and secret generation in secp256k1.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, urandom for secret generation, input parameters for signature verification, encoding functions.",
  "sinks": "Signature verification functions, encoding/decoding routines, validation functions that process input data.",
  "flows": "Input data (public keys, signatures, messages) flows into parsing and verification functions; secrets are generated and validated; encoding/decoding functions process data for storage or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; environment variable toggles for documentation/testing, which are benign; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cryptographic functions using well-established libraries. It validates inputs, handles secrets securely, and performs signature verification correctly. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. Environment variables influence non-critical code paths, typical for testing or documentation modes. The overall structure is clear and aligns with best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cryptographic utility library with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The low security risk score (~0.2) is justified by its cryptographic nature and environment-dependent configurations. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero.",
