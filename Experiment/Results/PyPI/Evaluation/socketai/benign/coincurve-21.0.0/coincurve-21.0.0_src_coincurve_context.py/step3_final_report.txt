  "purpose": "Manage secp256k1 cryptographic contexts with secure reseeding and thread safety.",
  "sources": "os.urandom for seed generation in reseed method",
  "sinks": "lib.secp256k1_context_randomize function, which uses the seed for context randomization",
  "flows": "urandom generates seed -> reseed() calls lib.secp256k1_context_randomize with seed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard cryptographic context management, no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Context class that validates context flags, creates a cryptographic context, and reseeds it using secure system entropy via os.urandom. Thread safety is maintained with a Lock. The reseed method ensures proper entropy use, and the singleton GLOBAL_CONTEXT is a common pattern. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure practices are evident. The code aligns with best practices for cryptographic context management, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation of cryptographic context management for secp256k1, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal and consistent with standard cryptographic practices. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.15, reflecting low inherent risk but acknowledging the importance of secure entropy sources.",
