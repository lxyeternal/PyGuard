  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation of cryptographic context management for secp256k1, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal and consistent with standard cryptographic practices. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.15, reflecting low inherent risk but acknowledging the importance of secure entropy sources."
