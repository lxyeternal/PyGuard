{
  "purpose": "The code defines a build hook for a Python package that copies the `_cffi_backend` extension module into the wheel and manages licensing files related to the `cffi` package during build time.",
  "sources": "Imports `_cffi_backend` module, reads distribution metadata for 'cffi' package, accesses license files, copies license file to a local directory.",
  "sinks": "Copies license file from package distribution to local build directory, deletes temporary license file after build.",
  "flows": "Import `_cffi_backend` -> Retrieve its file location -> Copy license file from distribution -> Save license locally -> Remove local license after build.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `_cffi_backend` module, which is an extension module; copying license files is standard build behavior; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no network activity or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard build hook for packaging. It accesses `_cffi_backend` to include its shared library in the package and manages license files by copying them from the distribution metadata. No suspicious data flows, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code are present. The operations are typical for ensuring licensing compliance and correct packaging. All file operations are local and related to package build metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to perform legitimate build-time packaging tasks related to including the `_cffi_backend` extension and its license. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
