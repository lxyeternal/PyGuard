  "purpose": "A build hook for copying the _cffi_backend extension module into the wheel and managing its license file to avoid requiring cffi as a runtime dependency.",
  "sources": "Import statements, _cffi_backend.__file__, distribution('cffi')",
  "sinks": "shutil.copy2(), os.remove()",
  "flows": "License file path retrieved from distribution, copied to local license path, then removed during finalize",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, standard use of imported modules and functions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom build hook that copies the _cffi_backend extension module into the package and manages its license file. It uses standard libraries and functions, with no evidence of malicious data handling or malicious code actions. It ensures the license file is present and correctly linked, then cleans up afterward. There are no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious activities. The logic appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate build process function without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It simply manages the inclusion of a specific extension module and its license file during package build.",
