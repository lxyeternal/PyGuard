{
  "purpose": "A custom build hook for copying the '_cffi_backend' extension module into the wheel to avoid runtime dependency on 'cffi'.",
  "sources": "Import of '_cffi_backend' module, reading distribution metadata, accessing files within the package distribution.",
  "sinks": "Copying license file to a local path, appending license info to build metadata, removing the local license file during finalization.",
  "flows": "The code reads the '_cffi_backend' module file and distribution metadata, then copies the LICENSE file from the package distribution to a local location, and later deletes it.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Usage of internal modules and copying license files are normal practices. No obfuscated or misleading code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a system and package modules, then defines a build hook class that copies a license file from the 'cffi' package distribution into the build directory, and cleans it up afterward. It includes a safety check ensuring only one LICENSE file is found. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious data exfiltration. All operations appear related to proper build process management without external communication or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a legitimate build process for packaging. It handles license copying to ensure license inclusion and cleans up afterward. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
