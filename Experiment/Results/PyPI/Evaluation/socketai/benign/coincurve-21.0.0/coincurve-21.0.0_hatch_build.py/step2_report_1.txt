  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Imports `_cffi_backend` module and retrieves its file path.\n- During build initialization, copies the license file from the `cffi` distribution into a local directory.\n- Appends the license filename to build metadata.\n- During finalization, deletes the temporary license file.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- The code's purpose is to include the `_cffi_backend` extension and its license in the package.\n- Uses standard library modules (`os`, `shutil`, `importlib.metadata`) and a build hook interface.\n- No network activity, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets.\n- No suspicious data flows or malicious behavior.\n- License handling is routine for packaging.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Clear, straightforward.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Well described.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Correct, no malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Accurate.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.1 (low, due to potential build process considerations).\n\n**Assessment:** The scoring aligns with the analysis. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Same.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Correct, routine build process.\n- Conclusion: Valid.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same.\n- Raw response: The JSON is well-formed, no suspicious content.\n- Analysis: Accurate.\n- Conclusion: Correct.\n- Confidence: 1.0.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Consistent.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Correct.\n- Conclusion: Valid.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate, no red flags.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same.\n- Analysis: Correct.\n- Confidence: 1.0.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n- All reports agree that the code is standard build process code, with no malicious activity.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is justified.\n- The security risk scores are very low, reflecting routine build operations.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, related to build process considerations.\n\n**In summary:**\nThe code is a legitimate build hook for including the `_cffi_backend` extension and its license file. The reports are consistent, and their scores are reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain malware score at 0.\n- Keep obfuscated at 0.\n- Set risk score at approximately 0.1, reflecting routine build operations.\n\nThis analysis confirms that the package poses no supply chain security threat based on the provided code and reports.",
