{
  "purpose": "This code defines a build hook for packaging Python projects, specifically copying the `_cffi_backend` extension module into the wheel and managing its license file.",
  "sources": "Imports `_cffi_backend` module, reads distribution metadata for 'cffi', accesses `__file__` attribute of `_cffi_backend`.",
  "sinks": "Copies license file from distribution to local build directory, removes temporary license file after build.",
  "flows": "Imports `_cffi_backend` -> Retrieves its file path -> Copies license file from distribution to build directory -> Deletes temporary license file after build.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code. The code handles license files and extension modules straightforwardly.",
  "analysis": "The script is a build hook for packaging, copying a C extension module into the distribution and managing license files. It uses standard library modules and a third-party build hook interface. The license handling involves copying and deleting files, which is normal for packaging processes. No data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The code’s purpose is to facilitate packaging, not execute any suspicious or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build hook intended for packaging Python extensions and license files. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The operations are routine and do not pose supply chain threats.",
