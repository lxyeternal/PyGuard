{
  "purpose": "A build hook that copies the `_cffi_backend` extension module into the wheel so that the `cffi` package is not required at runtime, and manages the associated license file.",
  "sources": "Imports `_cffi_backend`, accesses its `__file__`, retrieves the `cffi` distribution to locate the license file.",
  "sinks": "Copies license file to local directory, appends license filename to build metadata, then deletes the license file during finalization.",
  "flows": "Import `_cffi_backend` -> get its file path -> locate license in `cffi` distribution -> copy license to build directory -> cleanup license file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity. Routine license and extension handling during build.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build operations: importing a backend module, copying its license file from the distribution, and cleaning up. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The license handling is typical for packaging. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, low security risk, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign, routine nature of the code. No flaws or logical errors are identified. The routine file operations pose minimal risk, and the code does not perform any suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build hook for including the `_cffi_backend` extension and its license file. It poses no supply chain security threat or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate.",
