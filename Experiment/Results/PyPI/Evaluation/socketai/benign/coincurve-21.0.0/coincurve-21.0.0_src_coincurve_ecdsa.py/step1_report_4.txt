{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for handling ECDSA signatures, including serialization, deserialization, recovery, normalization, and conversion using the secp256k1 cryptographic library.",
  "sources": "Functions accept inputs such as signature bytes, message bytes, and optional hash functions; they also access the secp256k1 C library via ffi calls.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to secp256k1 structures and buffers, invokes library functions for signature processing, and outputs serialized or recovered key data.",
  "flows": "Input data (signatures, messages) flows through parsing, normalization, and serialization functions, ultimately interacting with the secp256k1 library functions for cryptographic operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The functions operate solely on cryptographic data and utilize well-defined external library calls.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard cryptographic utility module that interfaces with the secp256k1 C library for elliptic curve signature operations. It includes functions for converting signatures between different formats, recovering public keys from signatures, normalizing signatures, and converting recoverable signatures. The functions perform appropriate input validation, such as length checks and recovery ID validation, and handle errors by raising exceptions. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden behaviors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The functions are typical for cryptographic handling and do not invoke any network or system operations outside of the secp256k1 library, which is a well-known cryptographic library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a cryptographic utility module for elliptic curve signature processing. It performs standard operations using a reputable library without any suspicious behavior or malicious intent. It does not contain backdoors, data leaks, or harmful actions. All functions are consistent with normal cryptographic workflows.",
