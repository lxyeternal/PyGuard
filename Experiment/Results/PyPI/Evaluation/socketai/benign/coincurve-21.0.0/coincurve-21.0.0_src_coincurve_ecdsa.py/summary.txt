  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cryptographic utility module with no signs of malicious activity or backdoors. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), primarily due to untested functions but no malicious intent. The code appears secure, standard, and appropriate for cryptographic operations."
