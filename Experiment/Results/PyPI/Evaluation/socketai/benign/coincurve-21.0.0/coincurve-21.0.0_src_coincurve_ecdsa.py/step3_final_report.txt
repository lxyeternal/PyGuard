  "purpose": "Cryptographic utility functions for secp256k1 signatures, including serialization, deserialization, recovery, normalization, and conversion between recoverable and standard signatures.",
  "sources": "Input data includes DER-encoded signatures, serialized recoverable signatures, raw signatures, message hashes, and recovery IDs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the parsing and serialization functions that process external signature data, but they include validation to prevent misuse.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input signatures or messages through parsing or validation functions, then to cryptographic operations like recovery or normalization, with error handling at each step.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The only noted anomaly is the warning about some functions being untested or subject to change, which is standard in cryptographic libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code interfaces with the secp256k1 C library via ffi to perform signature serialization/deserialization, recovery, and normalization. It validates input lengths, recovery IDs, and message hashes, raising errors on invalid data. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The functions are typical for cryptographic utility modules, with proper error handling and validation. The warnings about untested functions suggest potential stability issues but not malicious intent. All evidence points to a standard, well-implemented cryptographic utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cryptographic utility module with no signs of malicious activity or backdoors. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), primarily due to untested functions but no malicious intent. The code appears secure, standard, and appropriate for cryptographic operations.",
