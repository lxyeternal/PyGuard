{
  "purpose": "Provides a utility class for managing multiple cleanup functions, supporting context management and exception handling during cleanup.",
  "sources": "Imports 'sys' module; optionally imports 'MultipleExceptions' from 'testtools' or defines it locally.",
  "sinks": "Executes cleanup functions via 'cleanup(*args, **kwargs)'. No untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No external untrusted data sources are used. The 'push' method adds cleanup functions which are later invoked in '__call__'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; no unsafe dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility for managing multiple cleanup functions, allowing them to be executed in reverse order, optionally handling multiple exceptions. It safely imports 'MultipleExceptions' or defines a fallback class. The cleanup functions are stored as callables with arguments and invoked in sequence during '__call__'. Exception handling is robust, with re-raising exceptions or collecting them based on 'raise_errors'. No external data input, network activity, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing cleanup functions with proper exception handling. It contains no malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues. The design is straightforward and safe.",
