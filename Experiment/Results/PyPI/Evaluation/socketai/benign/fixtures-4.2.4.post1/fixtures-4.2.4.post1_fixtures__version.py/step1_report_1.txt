  "purpose": "The code is generated by setuptools_scm to define version information for a package.",
  "sources": "Variables assignment statements (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version strings and tuples directly to variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded version strings are standard for package versioning; no suspicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version information using hardcoded strings and tuples, typical for package metadata. It includes a conditional import for type checking, which does not affect runtime behavior. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious operations. The code appears standard and benign, serving only to provide version metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious version metadata definition generated by setuptools_scm. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
