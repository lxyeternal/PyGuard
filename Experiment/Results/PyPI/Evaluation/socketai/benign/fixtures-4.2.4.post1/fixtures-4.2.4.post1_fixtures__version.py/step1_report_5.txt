  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables, no external data input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; simple variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual or obfuscated code, no suspicious behaviors. The code is a standard version declaration pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally defines version-related variables, assigns static version info, and avoids dynamic or external input. No signs of malicious behavior or hidden code. It is straightforward, used for package versioning, and aligns with typical practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration snippet generated by setuptools_scm, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
