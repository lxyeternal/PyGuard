  "purpose": "Define versioning information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and version tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no data leak or external effect.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version data to module variables; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version variables for a package, with conditional import logic based on TYPE_CHECKING. It includes standard version string and tuple assignments. No external input handling, no suspicious code behaviors, and no dynamic code execution or network activity. The code appears to be boilerplate generated by setuptools_scm, serving purely to store version metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated version metadata module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
