{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, primarily used for version tracking and management.",
  "sources": "Reading the string literal assigned to __version__ and version, and the tuple assigned to __version_tuple__ and version_tuple.",
  "sinks": "Assigning version strings and tuples; no untrusted data or external input processing observed.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of version string to __version__ and version, and version tuple to __version_tuple__ and version_tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains only straightforward version assignment with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version-related variables with hardcoded version information generated by setuptools_scm. It includes conditional typing imports that do not execute at runtime, only for type checking. There are no dynamic code executions, input reading, or external data handling. The code is minimal and appears standard for version management, with no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version definition code generated by setuptools_scm. No malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
