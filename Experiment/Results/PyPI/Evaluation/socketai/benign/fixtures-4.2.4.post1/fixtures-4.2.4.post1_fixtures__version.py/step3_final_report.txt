  "purpose": "This code provides static version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, with no dynamic or external data involved.",
  "sources": "The version string and tuple assignments are hardcoded; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs. The conditional TYPE_CHECKING block is standard for type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated version module with static assignments and no runtime data processing. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these scores. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version metadata snippet generated by setuptools_scm. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
