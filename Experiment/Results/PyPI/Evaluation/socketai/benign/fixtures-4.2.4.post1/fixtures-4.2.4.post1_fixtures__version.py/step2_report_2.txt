  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a straightforward, static assignment of version information, generated by setuptools_scm.\n   - It assigns hardcoded version strings and tuples to variables, with a conditional import for type checking.\n   - There are no dynamic operations, external inputs, or network activity.\n   - The code is typical for package version metadata and contains no obfuscation or malicious constructs.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is standard, benign, and generated automatically.\n   - No report points out any errors, flaws, or suspicious logic; all agree on its benign nature.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and aligns with standard practices for version management in Python packages.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all analyses correctly identify the code as standard.\n   - No evidence of malicious activity, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration, is present.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n5. **Consistency and Justification:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n   - The high confidence and zero scores for malware and obfuscation are justified.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a typical, auto-generated version metadata module.\n   - No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration snippet generated by setuptools_scm. All reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary. The scores reflect the benign nature, and there is no evidence to suggest any malicious intent or security concern.",
