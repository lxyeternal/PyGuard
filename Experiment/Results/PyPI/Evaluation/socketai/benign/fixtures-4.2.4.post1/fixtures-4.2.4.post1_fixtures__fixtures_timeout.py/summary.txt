  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a timeout fixture for testing purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a minimal security risk score (0.1) justified by the use of system signals, which could be misused in malicious contexts but are standard here."
