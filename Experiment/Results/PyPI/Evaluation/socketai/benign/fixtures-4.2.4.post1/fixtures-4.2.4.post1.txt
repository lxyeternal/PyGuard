The execution of user-supplied functions is expected and does not imply malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the execution of arbitrary functions, which is acceptable in trusted testing contexts. The scores should reflect this benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1)."
