  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a set of utility classes for mocking in unit tests, with no malicious behavior or security risks.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are reasonable given the code's nature.  \n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report notes that the code involves standard mocking patterns, with no suspicious data flows or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This aligns with the code's purpose.  \n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent, and the scores seem justified.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, it recognizes the code as standard mocking utilities with no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate for this context.  \n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is valid, and the scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is identified as a straightforward mocking utility with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, correctly states that the code is for mocking purposes without malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** The evaluation is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Justification & Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's purpose as testing utilities.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of mocking utilities for unit testing.  \n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- I agree with the existing scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.  \n- No changes needed.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain dependency appears safe, with no malicious or obfuscated code detected. It is a typical testing utility module with no security concerns.",
