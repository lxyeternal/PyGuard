  "purpose": "Utility classes for mocking objects and functions during unit testing using 'unittest.mock'.",
  "sources": "Parameters for patching objects, attributes, or multiple attributes; imports of 'mock' and 'fixtures'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code creates mock objects and patches solely within the testing context.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of mock patches via lambda functions that invoke 'mock.patch' or 'mock.patch.object'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard for testing utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper classes for mocking in unit tests, wrapping around 'unittest.mock'. It employs lazy evaluation with lambdas, manages cleanup, and uses a metaclass for default values. No external data, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing utility for mocking in Python. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk features. The scores are consistent with its purpose and content.",
