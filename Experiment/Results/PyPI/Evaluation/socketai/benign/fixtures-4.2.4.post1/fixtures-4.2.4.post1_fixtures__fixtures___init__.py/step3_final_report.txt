{
  "purpose": "Organizes and exports test fixture classes and functions for use in testing environments.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal fixture modules, defining the __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static code with no data flow.",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ declaration, with no runtime data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is static, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments, licensing info, an __all__ list, and import statements from internal modules. It does not perform any dynamic operations, network activity, or data processing. The imported modules are fixtures used for testing purposes, and there are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The static nature and organization suggest a benign purpose. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module for organizing test fixtures with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
