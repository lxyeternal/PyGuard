  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to assess the security implications, code integrity, and consistency of the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a static, module-level setup for test fixtures.\n- No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data processing is present.\n- The code only defines an `__all__` list and imports classes/functions from internal modules.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The reports uniformly assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores as zero, which aligns with the code's static and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Clear that the code is for defining and importing fixtures, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as safe.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Same as above; consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — justified.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Similar reasoning; no malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Same assessment; no issues detected.\n- **Scores:** Zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Same conclusion; purely structural, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Zero across all.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Code presence:** The code is static, only defining exports and importing classes.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** No signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Security risk:** No external inputs, no data flow, no system calls, no network activity.\n- **Score justification:** The zero scores for malware, obfuscated, and risk are appropriate and justified based on the code content.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and accurate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The code appears entirely benign, serving as a module for test fixtures.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the static, well-structured, and safe nature of the code. No security concerns are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action needed.",
