  "purpose": "This code defines and imports a set of fixtures for testing purposes, organizing them into __all__ and importing various classes and functions from submodules.",
  "sources": "Static code defining __all__ list, import statements importing classes and functions from multiple modules within the 'fixtures' package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present; the code mainly defines exports and imports.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; the code is static and used for testing infrastructure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs detected. The code is straightforward module organization and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up documentation, licensing info, and an __all__ list for module exports. It imports various fixture classes from internal modules, which are used in testing frameworks. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or data processing is present. The code is well-structured and adheres to common Python practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for organizing test fixtures with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe and does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities.",
