  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's nature, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code is purely static, consisting of comments, licensing info, an `__all__` list, and multiple import statements.\n- All imported modules are internal fixtures meant for testing, with no dynamic code execution, input handling, or external interactions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: organizing and exporting test fixtures.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — **correct**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — **correct**.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — **appropriate**, as there's no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The evaluation is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; static fixture definitions and imports.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — **correct**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — **correct**.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous; purely structural, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — **correct**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — **correct**.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — **correct**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — **correct**.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a benign, static module setup.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — **correct**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — **correct**.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Conclusion:** No problems detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The code is a standard, well-structured module for organizing test fixtures, with no suspicious or malicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Personal Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities or risks present.\n\n**In conclusion, all reports are accurate, and the code is safe.**",
