  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is purely static, consisting of comments, licensing, an `__all__` list, and import statements from internal modules.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, input handling, or data processing is present.\n- The imported modules are internal fixtures used for testing, mocking, environment management, etc.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n- The code is well-structured and follows standard practices for a test fixtures module.\n\n**Malware and obfuscation scores:**\n\n- Given the static, benign nature of the code, the malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should also be **0**, as there's no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk score justification:**\n\n- Since the code does not perform any operations beyond imports and declarations, the overall security risk is negligible.\n- All reports assign a risk score of **0**, which is appropriate.\n- No evidence suggests any hidden malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and risk scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:**\n\n- No changes are necessary; the reports correctly assess the code as safe and free of malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign module organizing and exporting test fixtures. It presents no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
