{
  "purpose": "This code provides a utility class for patching or mocking attributes of objects or modules during testing, allowing temporary modification and restoration of code behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads module and class attributes via getattr, __import__, and __dict__ access. No direct user input or external data sources detected.",
  "sinks": "Sets or deletes attributes on modules/classes/objects using setattr and delattr, potentially altering runtime behavior during tests.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> access nested attributes -> patch attributes with new values -> cleanup restores original state.",
  "anomalies": "The code only performs attribute manipulation and does not include any suspicious network, file, or system interactions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic present. Uses standard testing/mocking pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a MonkeyPatch class that modifies attributes of imported modules or classes for testing purposes. It includes logic to handle staticmethods, classmethods, and regular functions, ensuring proper wrapping. The _coerce_values function manages the replacement, considering descriptor types. The _setUp method handles module importation, attribute patching, and cleanup registration. No external data sources, network operations, or malicious code are evident. The code’s functionality is typical for test mocking and does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing utility for patching attributes in modules/classes. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and intended solely for testing purposes.",
