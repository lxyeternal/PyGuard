{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility class 'MonkeyPatch' for temporarily replacing or deleting attributes on objects, primarily for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads attribute values from objects via getattr, __dict__, and import mechanisms based on a string 'name' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The code sets or deletes attributes using setattr and delattr; it does not process untrusted input beyond attribute names and values specified by the user.",
  "flows": "Input: the 'name' parameter specifies a dotted path to an attribute; the flow involves importing modules, accessing objects, and then patching or deleting attributes as specified. No external untrusted data sources are directly read; the 'name' and 'new_value' are parameters provided during test setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code's primary function is to manipulate object attributes temporarily, which is typical for testing utilities. No obfuscated code, hidden network connections, or system manipulations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules dynamically based on a string 'name', accesses attributes, and modifies them temporarily for testing purposes. The _coerce_values function ensures correct handling of staticmethod, classmethod, and function attributes, preserving their semantics during patching. The MonkeyPatch class manages setup and cleanup of patches, including safe deletion. There are no indications of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or harmful system modifications. The code appears to be a standard testing utility with safe attribute manipulation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility designed for patching attributes during tests. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is to facilitate testing by temporarily modifying object state in a controlled manner.",
