{
  "purpose": "Provides fixture classes and utility functions for testing, without any apparent malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'fixtures._version', 'fixtures.fixture', 'fixtures._fixtures', and 'fixtures.testcase'. No external data input sources or user input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or sensitive data handling observed. No outputs or untrusted data processing identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows. The code mainly defines imports and exports for testing fixtures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports various fixture classes and defines a __all__ list for module exports. It also includes functions to load test suites. The structure is standard for a test utility module. There are no signs of malicious code, code injection, or suspicious behaviors. All components appear to be for testing purposes only, with no external data manipulation or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test fixtures module with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It primarily handles imports and module exports, with no evident malicious or harmful behavior.",
