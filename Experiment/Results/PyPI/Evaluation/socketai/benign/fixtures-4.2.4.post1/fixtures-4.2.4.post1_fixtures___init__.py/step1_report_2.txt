  "purpose": "The code provides a module for reusable test fixtures and related classes in Python testing frameworks.",
  "sources": "Import statements, the __all__ list, and function definitions such as test_suite and load_tests.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is being written to external systems, network, or insecurely handled.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are present; the code only defines and imports modules, variables, and functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The license comments are standard. No obfuscated or malicious code features present.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly consists of comments, license headers, imports, variable definitions, and two test-related functions. It imports various classes and functions from the fixtures package and defines test suite loading functions. No code reads sensitive data, performs network operations, or executes dynamic code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test fixtures setup and utility module with no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks.",
