{
  "purpose": "This module provides a set of fixtures and utility functions for testing purposes, mainly defining classes, importing modules, and setting up test suites.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (fixtures._version, fixtures.fixture, fixtures._fixtures, fixtures.testcase), and the list of fixture class names.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present. No network, file, or system calls, or data leakage points are visible.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks are identifiable, as the code mainly consists of class imports, variable definitions, and test setup functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. The code appears to be a standard test fixture setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various fixture classes and functions, defines an export list, and sets up test suite loading functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The code is standard for a testing utility module and contains no network activity, no handling of untrusted inputs, and no dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test fixture setup module with no malicious or security risk behavior. It does not contain any suspicious code or malicious intent, merely importing and exposing testing utilities.",
