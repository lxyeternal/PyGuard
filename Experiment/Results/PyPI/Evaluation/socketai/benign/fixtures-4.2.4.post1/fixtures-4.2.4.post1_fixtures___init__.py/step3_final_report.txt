{
  "purpose": "This code provides a collection of test fixture classes and functions for use in unit testing Python projects, facilitating reusable setup and teardown routines.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules and the __version__ variable; no external or untrusted data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs to external systems; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes and functions, defines __all__, and provides test suite functions, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard for test utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module organizing test fixtures with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks. It only imports classes, defines exports, and provides test suite functions. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The code's purpose is solely for testing infrastructure, and it does not handle external inputs or sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test fixtures module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
