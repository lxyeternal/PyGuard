{
  "purpose": "This code provides fixture management for testing, handling setup, cleanup, and resource details without performing any external actions or malicious operations.",
  "sources": "Methods like addCleanup, setUp, and getDetails access internal state and user-provided functions; no external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "Cleanup functions and setup routines could potentially be misused if malicious functions are passed, but in this code, they are controlled and internal.",
  "flows": "Source: addCleanup, setUp; Sink: cleanup functions called during cleanUp; flow is straightforward, managing resource lifecycle within tests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Conditional import of gather_details is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured fixture management library for testing environments. It manages resources, errors, and details without external system interactions, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The cleanup routines accept arbitrary functions, but in controlled test code, this is safe. The overall design is transparent and typical for testing utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score (0.1) is justified by the potential for misuse of cleanup functions, but in practice, it poses no threat. All signals indicate a safe, standard testing utility.",
