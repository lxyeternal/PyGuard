  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of a JSON query utility with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain sabotage. The main potential risk lies in the 'visit' method's implementation, which is not provided; if 'visit' executes untrusted code, it could introduce vulnerabilities. However, based on the provided code, no malicious activity is detected, and the security posture is strong. The scores are consistent with the code's structure and purpose."
