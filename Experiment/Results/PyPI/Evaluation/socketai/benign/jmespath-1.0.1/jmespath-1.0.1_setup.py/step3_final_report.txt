  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and including an executable script.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' for long description; includes 'bin/jp.py' as a script to be installed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file operations; no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A – static setup configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward setup script with no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The only external component is 'bin/jp.py', which is not examined here. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, assigning malware score 0 and obfuscation score 0. The risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting potential concern about the included script but no evidence of malicious activity in the setup code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The primary security concern depends on the content of 'bin/jp.py', which should be reviewed separately. The scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
