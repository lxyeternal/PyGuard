{
  "purpose": "Define various functions to create AST nodes representing different expressions and operations, likely for a parsing or query language.",
  "sources": "None; all functions are definitions that return data structures. No input reading or external data access present.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output actions are observed within these functions.",
  "flows": "None; as this is purely a set of data structure constructor functions without executable data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code strictly defines functions for constructing AST nodes.",
  "analysis": "The code provides helper functions to construct Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) nodes with specific types, children, and values. All functions are simple wrappers that return dictionaries representing nodes. There is no code execution, input handling, or network interaction. The structure appears to be a standard setup for building or manipulating ASTs, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for AST node creation. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured set of functions for a parser or query builder.",
