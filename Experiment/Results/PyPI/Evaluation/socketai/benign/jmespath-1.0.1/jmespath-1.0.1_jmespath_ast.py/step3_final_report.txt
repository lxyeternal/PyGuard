{
  "purpose": "These functions serve as utility constructors for creating Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) nodes, facilitating the building and manipulation of AST structures in a parser or compiler frontend.",
  "sources": "The functions accept parameters such as node names, child nodes, and values; these are typically provided by other parts of the parser or input data but are not directly read within these functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external outputs; the functions only generate and return data structures (dictionaries) based on input parameters without processing untrusted data or performing I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the functions and are used to construct AST node dictionaries; no external data flows into or out of the functions beyond these parameters, and there are no source-to-sink data flows that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of functions that generate static AST node dictionaries based on provided parameters. There are no external data inputs, network activities, or code execution mechanisms. The functions are pure data structure constructors, with no side effects or security-sensitive operations. The absence of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling indicates a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's static and structural nature. The code does not process untrusted data in a manner that could lead to vulnerabilities, nor does it contain any malicious payloads or obfuscation techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of utility functions for constructing AST nodes, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and assessments in all reports are accurate and justified, reflecting the code's straightforward and safe nature.",
