{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of functions to create AST node dictionaries for various node types in a custom expression language.",
  "sources": "Function calls with input parameters (e.g., 'name', 'expression', 'children', 'literal_value', 'index', 'key_name') that are used to generate AST nodes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct data output, network communication, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters to AST node structures; no untrusted data flows to dangerous sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. The functions are straightforward constructors for AST nodes.",
  "analysis": "The code provides helper functions for constructing AST nodes with specified types and child nodes. No evaluation of input data occurs within these functions; they are purely structural builders. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious payloads. The structure appears to be part of a parsing or query language framework, with no network, system, or data exfiltration activity evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for building AST node representations. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks within this fragment. It is purely structural and does not perform any dangerous actions.",
