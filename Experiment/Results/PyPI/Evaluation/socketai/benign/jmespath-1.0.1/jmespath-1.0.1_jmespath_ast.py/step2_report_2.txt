  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is purely utility functions for AST node creation, with no data flow from untrusted sources, no malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Accuracy:** The code indeed only constructs static data structures; no external data handling or code execution is present.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both are correctly scored as 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, justified by the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the functions are straightforward data structure constructors with no malicious intent.\n- **Accuracy:** Correct; no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both are 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that the functions are simple AST node constructors with no external data handling or malicious behavior.\n- **Accuracy:** Correct.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—benign utility functions for AST nodes with no malicious activity.\n- **Accuracy:** Correct.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with others, emphasizing the structural and benign nature of the code.\n- **Accuracy:** Correct.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that there are no security issues, malicious code, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward, purely defining functions for AST node creation.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  All malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and risk scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports do not assume malicious intent where none exists.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (benign utility functions with no security implications)\n\n**Overall, the code appears to be a safe, standard set of AST node constructors with no security risks.**",
