  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code is a set of utility functions for constructing AST nodes.\n- No external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is observed.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The functions are straightforward, returning static data structures based on input parameters.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0. These seem appropriate.\n- **Logic:** No issues; the reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly states that the code is a benign set of AST node constructors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0. Reasonable.\n- **Logic:** Sound.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; no malicious intent or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Logic:** Consistent.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Again, the functions are structural, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0. Suitable.\n- **Logic:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0. Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusions:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis. Given the code's nature, this is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n\n### Final thoughts:\n- The code is a utility module for AST node creation, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Summary:** The report evaluations are accurate and justified. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that appropriately.",
