  "purpose": "Define functions to create AST nodes for various expressions and data structures.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; all functions generate static AST node structures.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; functions only produce AST nodes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of factory functions for constructing AST nodes used in parsing or interpreting expressions. All functions are straightforward, returning predefined data structures representing nodes. There are no external data reads, no network or file operations, and no dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious intent, malicious payloads, or security risks are evident. The structure suggests safe code for AST node creation, possibly for a parser or compiler frontend.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for AST node creation with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to security issues.",
