  "purpose": "Define functions to create AST nodes representing various code structures for processing or evaluation.",
  "sources": "Function parameters and internal literals used to construct AST nodes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; functions return data structures without executing or evaluating inputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through function calls, constructing nested AST node dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of functions that generate AST node dictionaries representing different expressions or data structures, such as comparators, functions, fields, and logical operators. All functions are straightforward and purely create data objects based on inputs without executing or evaluating external data or performing side effects. There are no signs of malicious behavior like network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscated logic. The code appears to be a standard set of utilities for building an AST.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines data structure constructors for AST nodes, with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign utility module for representing expression trees.",
