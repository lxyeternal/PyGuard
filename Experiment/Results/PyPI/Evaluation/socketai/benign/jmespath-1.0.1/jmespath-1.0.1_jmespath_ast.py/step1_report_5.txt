{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of functions to create AST node structures for parsing or processing expressions in a structured format.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input or data; it only defines functions to generate data structures.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or external effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; functions only create and return data structures.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not include any suspicious or unusual behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of function definitions for creating AST node dictionaries with specified structure and properties. There are no external data reads, network operations, or system effects. The functions are straightforward, designed for building AST nodes with clear 'type', 'children', and 'value' fields. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be part of a larger parser or expression evaluator framework, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign; it provides utility functions for AST node creation without any malicious intent or security risks. No suspicious activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
