  "purpose": "Lexer/tokenizer for parsing expression language, likely JSONPath or similar.",
  "sources": "Input string expression processed character by character during tokenization.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; the code only yields tokens. Downstream processing of literals could be exploited if untrusted input is handled insecurely outside this code.",
  "flows": "Input expression -> internal character list -> token generation via yield.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of json.loads() on literals is standard, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a standard lexer for an expression language, tokenizing identifiers, numbers, strings, and operators. It uses json.loads() to parse string literals and identifiers, which is typical. No evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, network activity, or backdoors. The code does not perform any system modifications or external communications. The only potential concern is downstream processing of parsed literals, but within this code, no malicious activity is present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured expression lexer with no malicious intent or sabotage. The use of json.loads() is appropriate for parsing literals. The low security risk score is justified, and malware and obfuscation scores should remain at zero.",
