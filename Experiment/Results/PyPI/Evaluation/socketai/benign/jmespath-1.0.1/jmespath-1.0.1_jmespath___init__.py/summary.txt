  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for JSON querying. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score of 0.2 appropriately reflects the potential risk if untrusted expressions are used. No significant issues are identified, and the scores are consistent with the code's behavior."
