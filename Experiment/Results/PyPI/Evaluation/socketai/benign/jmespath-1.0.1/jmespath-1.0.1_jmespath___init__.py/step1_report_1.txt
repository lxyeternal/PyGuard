{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to compile and search JSON data using the jmespath library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'expression' parameter in both compile() and search() functions.",
  "sinks": "The search() function executes the parsed expression on provided data, which could potentially process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input 'expression' is parsed in compile() and search(), and in search() also processes 'data'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code simply wraps jmespath parser and search functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports jmespath components, defines a version, and provides two functions: compile() to parse an expression, and search() to parse and execute the expression on data. It uses the library's parser and search mechanisms without any additional logic or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious data handling, or suspicious behaviors such as network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward wrapper around the jmespath library for parsing and searching JSON data. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a benign utility code.",
