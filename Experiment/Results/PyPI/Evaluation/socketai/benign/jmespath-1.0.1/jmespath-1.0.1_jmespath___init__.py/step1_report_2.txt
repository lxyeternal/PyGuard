{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to compile and search JSON expressions using the jmespath library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'expression' parameter from function calls, and data input during search.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if search results include sensitive data; however, there are no direct data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input expression is parsed in compile() and in search(), then search() executes the parsed expression on provided data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. No dynamic execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports jmespath components and defines simple wrapper functions for parsing and searching JSON data. It does not perform any dangerous operations, handle environment variables, or invoke system commands. The functions rely on the jmespath library, which is standard for JSON querying. There are no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility wrapper for jmespath without malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code, and its security risk level is minimal.",
