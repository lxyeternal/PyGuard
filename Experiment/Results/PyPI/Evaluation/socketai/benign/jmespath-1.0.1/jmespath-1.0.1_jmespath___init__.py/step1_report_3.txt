{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to parse and search data using the jmespath library, a JSON query language.",
  "sources": "Input data to the 'search' function; the 'expression' parameter in both functions.",
  "sinks": "The 'search' method of the parser, which processes data; potential if 'data' is untrusted and manipulated maliciously.",
  "flows": "The 'search' function parses an expression, then searches data using that expression, with options possibly influencing behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. Usage of standard library features only.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'parser' and 'Options' from 'jmespath' and defines simple wrapper functions for parsing and searching JSON data. It does not include any dynamic execution, external network communication, or secret handling. The functions rely on the 'jmespath' library, which is a trusted open-source package, and do not appear to introduce malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around the 'jmespath' library for JSON querying. No malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. It appears to be a benign utility module.",
