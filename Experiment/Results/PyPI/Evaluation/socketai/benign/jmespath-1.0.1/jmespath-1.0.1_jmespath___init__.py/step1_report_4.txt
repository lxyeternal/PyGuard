{
  "purpose": "Provide parsing and searching functionalities using the jmespath library.",
  "sources": "Input data in the search function; expression parameter in compile and search functions.",
  "sinks": "The search function's output and parsed expressions could potentially be used to process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The compile function parses an expression into a syntax tree; the search function parses an expression and then searches the data with it, passing options if provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. Usage of external library is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for parsing and searching JSON-like data using jmespath. It imports only the parser and visitor components from the library. Functions are straightforward, with no apparent data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious data flows. No external inputs are directly handled beyond the function parameters, and the functions do not contain any obfuscated or unusual code. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are visible. The code appears to be a simple wrapper around jmespath library functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module for JSON querying using jmespath. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks present in this snippet.",
