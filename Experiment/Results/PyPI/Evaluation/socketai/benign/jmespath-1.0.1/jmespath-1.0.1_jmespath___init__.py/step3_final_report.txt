{
  "purpose": "A simple wrapper around the jmespath library providing compile() and search() functions for parsing and executing JSON queries.",
  "sources": "The functions parse expressions using parser.Parser().parse(expression) and pass data to search().",
  "sinks": "The search() function executes the parsed expression on provided data, potentially processing untrusted expressions.",
  "flows": "Expression input is parsed in compile() or search(), then used to search data; untrusted expressions flow from input to parser and execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of Options from jmespath.visitor; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around the jmespath library, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity. It processes expressions and data in a controlled manner. The main security consideration is that parsing untrusted expressions could lead to resource exhaustion or unexpected behavior, but no active malicious behavior is present. The code does not handle secrets or perform unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for JSON querying. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score of 0.2 appropriately reflects the potential risk if untrusted expressions are used. No significant issues are identified, and the scores are consistent with the code's behavior.",
