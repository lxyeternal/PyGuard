{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define utility functions for class method handling, focusing on string representations and inspecting class methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'sys' and 'inspect' modules, as well as from the parameters passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks where untrusted data could cause a data leak or security effect, as the code does not handle external input or output.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules to defining functions that manipulate class objects, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The functions are straightforward utility functions without obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines simple functions to return class methods or to wrap classes with string and representation methods. There is no evidence of data being read from untrusted sources, no data being sent externally, and no dynamic execution or obfuscation. The code is benign and appears to be part of a larger utility library. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly utility functions for class inspection and method wrapping. It does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities based on the provided snippet.",
