  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as utility functions for class method inspection and string representation handling.\n- The code imports standard modules (`sys`, `inspect`, `itertools`) and defines functions that are benign, such as `with_str_method`, `with_repr_method`, and `get_methods`.\n- No external input, network activity, file operations, or environment modifications are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are detected.\n- The code appears straightforward and typical for utility purposes in larger codebases.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or suspicious logic?**  \n  No. The code is purely utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Is there any evidence of code injection, backdoors, or obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned appropriate?**  \n  All reports assign malware and securityRisk scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, appropriate since there's no security concern.\n\n### Any discrepancies or suggestions:\n\n- The **confidence scores** are 1 across all reports, which seems reasonable given the clarity and benign nature.\n- The **analysis and conclusions** are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nBased on the code and reports, I agree with the provided scores. The code is benign utility code with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary. The code is safe and serves a benign purpose.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
