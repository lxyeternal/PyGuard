  "purpose": "Utility functions for class method inspection and string type handling.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, inspect, itertools.zip_longest; functions that operate on class objects.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause vulnerabilities; no input/output or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; functions mainly perform introspection and type handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code performs standard introspection and type handling without any obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines simple utility functions for class method retrieval and string type handling. The with_str_method and with_repr_method functions simply return the class unaltered, serving as placeholders or decorators. get_methods yields class method names and functions via inspect. No external input handling, no data exfiltration, no network activity, or security-critical operations are present. The code is straightforward and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as utility functions for class introspection and type handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
