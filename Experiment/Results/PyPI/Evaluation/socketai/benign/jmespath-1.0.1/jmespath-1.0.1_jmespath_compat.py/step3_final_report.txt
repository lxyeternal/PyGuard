  "purpose": "Utility functions for class introspection and string representation handling in Python.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`sys`, `inspect`, `itertools`), function definitions (`with_str_method`, `with_repr_method`, `get_methods`).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "The functions operate on class objects to yield method names and return classes unaltered; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and lacks suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines utility functions that inspect class methods or return classes unchanged. It does not handle external input, perform network or file operations, or execute dynamic code. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The functions are benign and typical in larger codebases. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and intent. Confidence scores are high (1), justified by the code's clarity. No modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The reports are accurate and the scores appropriate.",
