{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define utility functions for class method handling and string representation methods, likely intended for use in larger programs.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, inspect, and itertools modules; reads function definitions and class attributes via inspect.getmembers.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations; code primarily defines functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no obfuscated patterns or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines simple decorator functions to modify or return classes, and includes a generator to retrieve class methods. No network, file, or environment variable interactions are present. The functions do not perform any dangerous operations or data leaks. The use of inspect to list class methods is benign. There are no signs of code injection, data theft, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward utility code with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves as a helper for class and method manipulation, which is typical in larger codebases.",
