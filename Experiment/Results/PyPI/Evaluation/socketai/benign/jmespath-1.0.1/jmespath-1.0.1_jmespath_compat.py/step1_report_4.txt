{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for class modifications and method retrieval, likely part of a larger module or library.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'sys' and 'inspect' modules; no external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sink points that process untrusted data or perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily defines functions and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules 'sys' and 'inspect', defines simple wrapper functions for class methods, and provides a generator to retrieve class methods. There are no apparent malicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The functions are straightforward and benign, with no network or system modifications observed.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be benign utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply provides mechanisms to modify or inspect class methods.",
