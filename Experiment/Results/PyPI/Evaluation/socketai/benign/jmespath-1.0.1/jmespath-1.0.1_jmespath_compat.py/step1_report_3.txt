{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define utility functions for handling string types and class methods, likely for use in a larger project or framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads modules 'sys', 'inspect', and 'itertools', and inspects class methods via 'inspect.getmembers'. No external untrusted input is read.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system modifications. No untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "The code only retrieves class methods and does not process or transfer untrusted data. No data flow from source to sink is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to modify or retrieve class behaviors related to string representations, which are straightforward utility functions. It imports standard libraries but does not perform any data processing, input/output, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions for class manipulation. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
