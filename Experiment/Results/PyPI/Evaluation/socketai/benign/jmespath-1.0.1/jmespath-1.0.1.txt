The purpose is solely to facilitate error reporting, which is safe and necessary. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of a JSON query utility with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain sabotage. The main potential risk lies in the 'visit' method's implementation, which is not provided; if 'visit' executes untrusted code, it could introduce vulnerabilities. However, based on the provided code, no malicious activity is detected, and the security posture is strong. The scores are consistent with the code's structure and purpose."

The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score of 0.2 appropriately reflects the potential risk if untrusted expressions are used. No significant issues are identified, and the scores are consistent with the code's behavior."
