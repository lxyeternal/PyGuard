  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports confirm that the code defines custom exception classes for handling various parsing and syntax errors in JMESPath expressions.\n- They highlight that the code is straightforward, with no external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The purpose is solely error reporting within a parsing library.\n\n**Step-by-step evaluation:**\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**\n   - The code only contains class definitions for exceptions, string formatting for error messages, and a decorator for string representation.\n   - No external data handling, no code injection, no network/file system access, no obfuscated code.\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code appears correct and standard for defining exception classes.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n   - The use of `super()` calls and string formatting seems appropriate.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the analysis. No malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0, since no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Justification:**\n   - The absence of any external data processing, code execution, or network activity justifies a zero score.\n   - The purpose is purely internal error handling, which does not pose security risks.\n\n5. **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:**\n   - No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; the code is purely definitional.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is safe and standard.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores assigned in reports (all zeros for malware and obfuscated, zero for risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0** — No vulnerabilities or security risks identified.\n\n**Overall Justification:**\nThe code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes used for error handling in a parsing library. It does not perform any external operations, does not process untrusted input in a way that could lead to code injection, and contains no suspicious patterns. The purpose is solely to facilitate error reporting, which is a benign and necessary part of the library.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, non-malicious, and poses no security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
