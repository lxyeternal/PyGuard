{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various parsing and syntax errors in JMESPath expressions.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and methods that initialize exception objects and set error details.",
  "sinks": "String formatting in __str__ methods which generate error messages for display or logging.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated with error details and their __str__ methods are called to produce error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no code injection, no network or file system access, and no obfuscated or dynamic code present. The code mainly defines data structures for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, inheriting from built-in Error classes, with methods for detailed error descriptions. All code is straightforward and focused on error message formatting. No external data input handling, network activity, or suspicious behavior observed. No malicious patterns or backdoors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for a parser. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected. The purpose is solely to handle error reporting within the JMESPath parsing context.",
