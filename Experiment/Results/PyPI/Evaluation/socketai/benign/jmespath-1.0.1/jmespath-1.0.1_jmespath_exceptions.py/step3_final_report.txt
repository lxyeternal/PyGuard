{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various parsing and syntax errors in JMESPath expressions, primarily for error reporting and debugging.",
  "sources": "Error message parameters such as lex_position, token_value, token_type, lexer_position, lexer_value, message, expected and actual arity, current_value, actual_type, expected_types, and expression strings.",
  "sinks": "Error message strings generated in __str__ methods; no external data or untrusted input processed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into exception class constructors; error details are stored as instance variables; __str__ methods format these details into descriptive error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors; code is straightforward class definitions for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple exception classes for parsing errors, each with custom __str__ methods for detailed error messages. No external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The classes serve solely for internal error reporting within a larger library. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is standard, well-structured, and purpose-specific, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for a parsing library. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The purpose is solely to facilitate error reporting, which is safe and necessary. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
