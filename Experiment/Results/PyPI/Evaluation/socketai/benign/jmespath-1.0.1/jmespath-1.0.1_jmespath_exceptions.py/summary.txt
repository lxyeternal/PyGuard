  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for a parsing library. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The purpose is solely to facilitate error reporting, which is safe and necessary. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature."
