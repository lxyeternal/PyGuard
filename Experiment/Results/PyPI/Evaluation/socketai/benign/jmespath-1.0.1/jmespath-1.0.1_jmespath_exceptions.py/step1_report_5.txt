  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to parsing and evaluating JMESPath expressions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all input comes from exception instantiation parameters within the code.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs; code mainly raises exceptions with messages.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; exception messages are constructed from internal parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; the code only defines exception classes with string representations for error reporting.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively defines custom exception classes for handling various errors related to JMESPath parsing and evaluation. It includes classes for parse errors, incomplete expressions, lexer errors, arity mismatches, type errors, empty expressions, and unknown functions. The classes use string formatting to generate error messages, but do not process or handle external input in a way that could lead to code injection or data leakage. There are no network operations, file I/O, or dynamic code execution mechanisms present. All functionality is standard for error handling within a Python module, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a set of error class definitions for JMESPath expression handling. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It is purely for error reporting and does not perform any harmful operations.",
