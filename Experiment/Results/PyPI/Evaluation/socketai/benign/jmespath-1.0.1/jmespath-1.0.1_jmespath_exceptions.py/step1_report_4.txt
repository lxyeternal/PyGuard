{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling errors related to JMESPath expression parsing, lexing, and type validation.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; mainly class instantiation and error handling mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "Error message strings used in exception messages, potentially exposed if caught and displayed.",
  "flows": "Exception creation and string conversion flow, primarily used for error reporting.",
  "anomalies": "Use of potentially verbose error messages with string interpolation; no hardcoded secrets or sensitive data present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, many decorated with 'with_str_method' to generate string representations. Error messages are constructed from class attributes, mostly related to parsing and type validation. No user input or external data sources are processed directly. No code injection, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The classes are structured solely for error handling, and there is no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. No suspicious patterns, malicious behavior, or supply chain attacks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining exception classes used in the context of JMESPath expression parsing. It does not perform any malicious activities or contain malicious code. It is safe from security threats related to supply chain malware or data leaks.",
