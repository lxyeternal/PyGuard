{
  "purpose": "This code defines various exception classes used for parsing and validating JMESPath expressions, including errors related to syntax, function arity, type mismatches, and other parsing issues.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines classes and methods for internal error handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no untrusted data outputs or external communication points.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code solely consists of class definitions with no data processing or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors, are present. The code uses straightforward class inheritance and string formatting for error messages.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes to handle various errors in parsing JMESPath expressions. The classes use standard inheritance, string formatting, and include no external data processing or network operations. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscated code, are observed. The code appears to serve its purpose as a part of a larger parsing framework without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of error handling classes for a JMESPath parser. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security risks. It appears to be purely for internal error reporting within a parsing library.",
