{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling errors in JMESPath expression parsing and evaluation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user inputs are read; the code only defines classes and methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations such as network communication, file I/O, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The code primarily involves error handling and message formatting within exception classes; no data flows from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code is structured for error handling and does not execute external commands or access sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for various custom exceptions, mainly for parsing and expression errors. All classes inherit from standard exceptions and include message formatting methods. The use of decorators (@with_str_method) appears to be for string representation purposes. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or code execution mechanisms present. The code appears to be standard for a library's error handling module. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of exception class definitions intended for error handling in a JMESPath parsing library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a standard, safe implementation for managing errors and exceptions.",
