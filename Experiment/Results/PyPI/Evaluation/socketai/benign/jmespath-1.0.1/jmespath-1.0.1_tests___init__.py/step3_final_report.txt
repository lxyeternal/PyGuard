  "purpose": "Utility functions to convert jmespath AST nodes into s-expressions for testing and debugging.",
  "sources": "AST nodes passed as arguments to as_s_expression and _as_s_expression functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; functions process in-memory data structures only.",
  "flows": "AST node -> recursive traversal -> string parts -> concatenated s-expression string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward recursive string building, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and jmespath.ast, then defines functions to recursively convert AST nodes into string representations. It handles specific node types and processes children nodes. No external input, network activity, or code execution occurs. The functions are simple and clear, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior. The code's purpose is solely for testing or debugging AST structures. No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for converting AST nodes into s-expressions, with no security risks or malicious behavior. All signals and scores are appropriate and justified.",
