{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define helper functions for creating s-expressions from an abstract syntax tree (AST) for unit testing purposes, specifically for the jmespath library.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources are present; the code imports modules and defines functions only.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the functions operate solely on in-memory objects and produce string representations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and mainly for test utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and the 'ast' module from 'jmespath'. It defines functions to generate s-expressions from AST nodes for easier testing. The functions are purely for data transformation and do not involve any network, file, or environment interactions. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe utility for unit testing AST structures with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only manipulates in-memory data for formatting purposes.",
