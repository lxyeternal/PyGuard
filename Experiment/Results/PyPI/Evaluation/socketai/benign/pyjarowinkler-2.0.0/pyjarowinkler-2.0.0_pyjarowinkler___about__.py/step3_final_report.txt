  "purpose": "Assigns the version string for the package, serving as metadata.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; simple assignment statement.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line assigning a version string to __version__, with no inputs, outputs, functions, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify its benign, standard nature. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are justified and accurate.",
