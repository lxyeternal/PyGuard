  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only assigns a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or complex logic.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward version declaration, typical in Python packages, with no issues.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign `securityRisk` and `malware` scores of 0.\n   - This aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - Malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All assessments are based on the code's actual content.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Judgment:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I agree with the reports' assessments. No malicious activity or security concerns are present.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a standard, harmless version declaration typical in Python packages.",
