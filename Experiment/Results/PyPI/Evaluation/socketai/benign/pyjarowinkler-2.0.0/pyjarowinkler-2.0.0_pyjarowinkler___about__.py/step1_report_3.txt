  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a single string assignment to __version__, with no signs of obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the __version__ attribute, which is a common practice in Python packages. There are no additional code elements, functions, or logic present that could indicate malicious behavior or security risks. The simplicity of this snippet indicates it's a standard version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward version assignment with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is a typical part of package metadata.",
