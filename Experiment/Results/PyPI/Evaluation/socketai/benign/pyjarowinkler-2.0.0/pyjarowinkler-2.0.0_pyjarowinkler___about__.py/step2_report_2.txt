  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the code in question:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, or complex logic involved.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their description. They correctly identify that the code is minimal, standard, and contains no suspicious activity.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the code's simplicity.  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the minimal, benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports suggest any behavior that would justify a higher risk score. The code is straightforward and typical for package versioning.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   Since the code only assigns a version string, there's no indication of malicious behavior. The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports are cautious and based on observable code, not assumptions. They correctly conclude the code is benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- No changes needed; the scores reflect the code's benign nature.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent.",
