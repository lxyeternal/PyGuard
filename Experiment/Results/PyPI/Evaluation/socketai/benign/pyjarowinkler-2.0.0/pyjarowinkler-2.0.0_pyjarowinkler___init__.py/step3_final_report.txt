  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for the Jaro Distance algorithm, with metadata and documentation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code is a class definition with a docstring.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no input/output or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process data or perform data flow operations.",
  "anomalies": "Incorrect use of super() in the exception class: 'super(Exception, self).__init__(message)' instead of 'super().__init__(message)'. This is a bug, not malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class definition with a descriptive docstring. It contains a bug in the super() call which would cause a runtime error if the exception is raised, but it does not introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external interactions are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate. The bug is a minor implementation issue and does not elevate security risk. Overall, the code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal utility component with a minor bug in exception handling. There is no evidence of malicious activity, malware, or security issues. The existing scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
