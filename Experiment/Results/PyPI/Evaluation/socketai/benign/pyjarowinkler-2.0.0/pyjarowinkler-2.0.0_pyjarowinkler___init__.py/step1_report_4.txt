{
  "purpose": "To provide a function for calculating the Jaro Winkler distance between two strings, indicating their similarity or distance.",
  "sources": "The code contains no input reading or data fetching mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or send data to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from source to sink are present, as the code is only a class definition with no data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only defining a custom exception class. No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "This code defines metadata, an author, and a custom exception class intended for use in a larger module calculating string similarity. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or contain suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a small, benign part of a string similarity library. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or security issues within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless, standard class definition for exception handling in a string similarity library. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
