  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is minimal, defining a class and a docstring, with no external data handling, network activity, or input/output operations.  \n   - The only technical issue noted is the incorrect use of `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)` instead of `super().__init__(message)`. This is a bug, not malicious code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic or Reasoning**  \n   - The main flaw is the super() call in the custom exception class. All reports agree on this.  \n   - No other logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which seems appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), reflecting that the reviewers are certain about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   - No report assigns a risk score above 0.5, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.  \n   - The only \"issue\" is a minor bug in exception handling, which does not elevate the risk score.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent; they only note the super() bug.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, no security risk, and no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — The only flaw is a minor bug in exception handling, which does not pose a security risk.\n\n### Final Remarks:\nThe code is a simple, benign utility class with a small implementation bug. There are no security risks, malware, or malicious intent present.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe and standard.\n- The bug in the super() call should be fixed but does not impact security.\n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI agree with the existing assessments: malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
