  "purpose": "Provides functionality to calculate the Jaro Winkler distance between two strings, which is used for string similarity comparison.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data sources present in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leakage points are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is only defining metadata and an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module-level docstring explaining the purpose and licensing, sets an author attribute, and declares a custom exception class. There are no external data inputs, network connections, or suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a simple, safe utility class definition with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for string similarity and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not perform any harmful operations, data leaks, or security risks.",
