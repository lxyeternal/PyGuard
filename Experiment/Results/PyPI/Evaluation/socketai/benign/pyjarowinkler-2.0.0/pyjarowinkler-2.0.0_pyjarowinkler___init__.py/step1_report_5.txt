  "purpose": "Calculate Jaro-Winkler distance for string similarity measurement.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; class definition and exception declaration.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no processing of external input.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs; class is standard for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines metadata and a custom exception class related to string similarity calculations. It includes no external data access, network operations, or suspicious behaviors. The exception class is standard and does not contain any obfuscated or malicious code. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward utility component with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility class for error handling within a string similarity module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious activities, or security risks.",
