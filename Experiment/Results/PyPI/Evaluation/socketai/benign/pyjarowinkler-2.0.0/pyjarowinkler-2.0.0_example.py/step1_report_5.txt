  "purpose": "Demonstrates usage of the get_jaro_distance function from the pyjarowinkler.distance module to compare two strings.",
  "sources": "Input strings in the get_jaro_distance function call: 'faremviel' and 'farmville'.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs the calculated similarity score, but does not write to external files or network.",
  "flows": "Input strings (sources) are processed by get_jaro_distance, which returns a float (similarity score), then output to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known library, performs a simple similarity calculation, and outputs the result. No external network connections, data leaks, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and intended for similarity measurement.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign example demonstrating a string similarity function from a legitimate library. No malicious intent or security risks identified.",
