{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates usage of the get_jaro_distance function from the pyjarowinkler.distance module to compute string similarity.",
  "sources": "Input strings 'faremviel' and 'farmville' in the get_jaro_distance function call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed by get_jaro_distance, with no further data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward implementation with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pyjarowinkler.distance module, calls get_jaro_distance with hardcoded strings, and prints the result. No external data sources, network activity, or credential handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a simple demonstration or test of a string similarity function.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign example code that utilizes a standard library for string comparison. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
