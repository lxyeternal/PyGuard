{
  "purpose": "Demonstration of using the get_jaro_distance function from the pyjarowinkler module to compare two strings.",
  "sources": "Input strings 'faremviel' and 'farmville' provided directly in the code.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only performs a distance calculation and prints the result.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed to get_jaro_distance; output is printed to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, no data leaks, or obfuscated code. Usage of a known open-source library is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function from a well-known open-source library (pyjarowinkler). It compares two hardcoded strings using get_jaro_distance and prints the similarity score. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The code is straightforward, with no external data inputs, no network activity, and no sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for string similarity measurement using an open-source library. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
