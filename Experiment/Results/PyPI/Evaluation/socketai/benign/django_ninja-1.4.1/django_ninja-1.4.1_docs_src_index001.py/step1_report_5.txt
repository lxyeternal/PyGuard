{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a simple Django web application with an API endpoint that adds two integers.",
  "sources": "The API endpoint receives query parameters 'a' and 'b' from the request URL.",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs the sum of 'a' and 'b'. No data is written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow from the request URL to the add function, which computes their sum and returns it.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious logic. The API performs a simple addition without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Django modules and the 'ninja' API framework. It defines a GET endpoint '/add' that accepts two integers and returns their sum. The URL patterns include an admin interface and the API routes. No external data sources, no sensitive data handling, and no malicious patterns are present. The functionality appears straightforward and intended for basic arithmetic operations. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign implementation of a Django API with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe for use as a simple addition service.",
