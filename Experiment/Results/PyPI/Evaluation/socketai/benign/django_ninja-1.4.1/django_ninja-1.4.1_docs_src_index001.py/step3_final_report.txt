  "purpose": "Defines a simple Django API endpoint '/add' that accepts two integers via URL query parameters 'a' and 'b' and returns their sum in JSON format.",
  "sources": "URL query parameters 'a' and 'b' received in the 'add' function.",
  "sinks": "Return of JSON response containing the sum; no external network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow from URL query into the 'add' function, then the result is returned as JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, transparent implementation of an addition API using Django and NinjaAPI. It accepts two integers via URL parameters, processes them in a simple function, and returns the sum as JSON. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, malicious network activity, or vulnerabilities are present. The data flow is direct, with no side effects or data leaks. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk scores (~0.1). Given the simplicity and lack of security issues, the overall security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate; however, the minimal security risk could be set to 0 to reflect the absence of concerns. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
