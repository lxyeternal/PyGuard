  "purpose": "Define a simple Django web application with an API endpoint for addition.",
  "sources": "User input from URL query parameters 'a' and 'b' in the '/add' API endpoint.",
  "sinks": "Return of the sum result in JSON format; potential exposure of input data if misused.",
  "flows": "Input from URL query parameters -> processed in 'add' function -> output as JSON response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code appears straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Django admin interface and an API using NinjaAPI. The '/add' endpoint accepts integer query parameters 'a' and 'b' and returns their sum in JSON. The data flow is simple, with no dynamic code execution, data leakage, or external network interactions. No obfuscated or malicious code features detected. It appears to be a minimal, standard implementation for a mathematical API.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of a Django API endpoint for addition. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
