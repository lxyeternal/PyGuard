  "purpose": "To define URL routes and an API endpoint for adding two integers in a Django web application using the NinjaAPI framework.",
  "sources": "The API endpoint '/add' which receives 'a' and 'b' as query parameters.",
  "sinks": "The addition operation 'a + b' which processes input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow from HTTP GET request to the add function, which returns their sum.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code patterns present. No use of unsafe functions or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a simple Django application with an API endpoint '/add' that takes two integer query parameters and returns their sum. It uses the NinjaAPI framework, which is standard for such APIs. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The function performs a straightforward addition operation without any external system interaction or unsafe data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, benign implementation of an API endpoint for adding two numbers. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use.",
