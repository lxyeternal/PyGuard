No user input is used in dangerous contexts, no file I/O, network connections, or system modifications are present. The code structure is typical for a basic Django project with REST API endpoints. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code, and the logic is transparent. The API simply performs a safe addition operation without side effects or data leaks.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code appears to be a benign, straightforward API implementation with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.\",\n  \"confidence\": 1,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0\n}",
