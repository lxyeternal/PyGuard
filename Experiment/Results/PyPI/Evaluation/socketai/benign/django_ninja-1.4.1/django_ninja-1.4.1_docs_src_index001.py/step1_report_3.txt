{
  "purpose": "Provides a simple Django web application with an API endpoint for adding two integers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' from the API GET request URL.",
  "sinks": "The addition operation itself is safe; no direct data leakage points or insecure sinks are present.",
  "flows": "User sends 'a' and 'b' via GET request, which are processed by the 'add' function, returning their sum.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. No use of insecure functions or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal Django application with an API endpoint using NinjaAPI. It accepts two integer query parameters and returns their sum. No external data sources or sensitive data handling are involved. The implementation is straightforward and uses standard libraries and practices. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard implementation of a simple add API endpoint in Django with no malicious intent or security risks.",
