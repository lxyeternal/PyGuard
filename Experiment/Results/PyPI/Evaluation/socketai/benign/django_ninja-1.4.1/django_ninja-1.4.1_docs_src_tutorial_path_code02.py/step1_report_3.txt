  "purpose": "Define an API endpoint to retrieve an item by its ID.",
  "sources": "The 'item_id' parameter from the URL path.",
  "sinks": "Return statement using 'item_id' directly in a dictionary response.",
  "flows": "Input 'item_id' flows from URL parameter to response dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. No use of eval, exec, or unsafe data handling. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a GET endpoint '/items/{item_id}' which accepts an integer 'item_id' from the URL. It then returns a JSON object containing 'item_id'. There are no data leaks, no external network calls, and no processing of untrusted data beyond returning it. The function does not perform any insecure operations or contain obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, safe endpoint implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
