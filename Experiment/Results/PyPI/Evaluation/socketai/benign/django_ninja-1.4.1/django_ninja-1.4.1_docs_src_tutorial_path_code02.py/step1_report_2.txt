  "purpose": "Define an API endpoint that returns an item ID based on the request.",
  "sources": "The path parameter 'item_id' which is received as an integer from the URL.",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs the 'item_id' directly as part of a JSON response.",
  "flows": "Input from URL path parameter 'item_id' flows directly into the response without modification or validation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with minimal complexity. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a GET endpoint '/items/{item_id}' that extracts 'item_id' from the URL. The function simply returns a JSON object containing 'item_id'. The code does not perform any data validation beyond the type hint, nor does it involve external data sources, environment variables, or insecure operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple API endpoint with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs a basic function of returning the provided 'item_id'.",
