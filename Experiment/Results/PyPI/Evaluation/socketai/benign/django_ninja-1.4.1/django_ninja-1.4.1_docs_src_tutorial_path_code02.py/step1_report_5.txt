  "flows": "Request path input -> function parameter 'item_id' -> return JSON with 'item_id'",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs observed; the code is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code defines a GET API endpoint using a decorator. It captures 'item_id' from the URL path and returns it in a JSON response. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or insecure practices. The code is minimal and standard for a web API route, with no external data handling or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple API route handler with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its intended purpose.",
