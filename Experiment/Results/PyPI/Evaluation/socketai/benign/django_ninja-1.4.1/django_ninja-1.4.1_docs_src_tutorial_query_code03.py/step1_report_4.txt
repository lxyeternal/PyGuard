  "purpose": "A simple API endpoint that returns provided query parameters",
  "sources": "Input parameters s, b, d, i from HTTP request query string",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the input parameters, potential data leak if sensitive data is included",
  "flows": "Data flows from request query parameters to the return list",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious functions, or unusual code patterns detected; code appears straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code defines an API GET endpoint /example with optional query parameters of various types. It directly returns these parameters without processing, validation, or side effects. No use of environment variables, external connections, or dynamic code execution is present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign API endpoint that returns input parameters. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security issues based on the provided code.",
