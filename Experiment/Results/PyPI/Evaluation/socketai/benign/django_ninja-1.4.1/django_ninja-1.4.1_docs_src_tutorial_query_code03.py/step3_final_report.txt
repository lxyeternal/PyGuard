  "purpose": "A simple GET API endpoint that accepts four optional parameters and returns them directly in a list.",
  "sources": "The function parameters s, b, d, i received via HTTP GET request query string.",
  "sinks": "Returning the parameters directly in the response; potential exposure if sensitive data is passed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are received from the request query, then returned without validation or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with no obfuscation, external calls, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a GET endpoint that accepts four optional parameters and returns them as a list. It does not perform validation, sanitization, or any processing, which makes it vulnerable to data leakage if sensitive data is passed. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external malicious calls. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is present. The security risk score is minimal (around 0.1), reflecting potential data exposure but not an actual vulnerability. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple echo endpoint with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security consideration is potential data leakage if sensitive data is passed as parameters, but this is inherent to such echo endpoints and not a vulnerability. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
