  "purpose": "Define an API endpoint that returns input parameters as a list.",
  "sources": "Request parameters s (string), b (boolean), d (date), i (integer).",
  "sinks": "Return statement output; no direct sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Request inputs are received via parameters, returned directly without processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No use of environment variables or insecure operations. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple API GET endpoint that accepts four optional parameters of various data types and returns them as a list. There are no external data sources, no input validation or sanitization, and no dangerous operations or code flows. The code appears straightforward and typical for an API endpoint. There are no signs of malicious intent, unusual code, or security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic API endpoint with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply echoes input parameters. No anomalies or malicious activity are detected.",
