{
  "purpose": "Define an API endpoint that returns provided query parameters",
  "sources": "Input parameters: s (string), b (boolean), d (date), i (integer) from request query",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the received parameters; no data sink that leaks or affects system security",
  "flows": "Request query parameters -> API endpoint -> return response with parameters",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple GET endpoint '/example' with optional query parameters of various types. It directly returns these parameters in the response without processing or storing them. No input validation or sanitization occurs, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No external data access, no system modification, and no suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward API endpoint designed for testing or demonstration purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign piece of code.",
