  "purpose": "Define an API endpoint that returns provided query parameters s, b, d, and i.",
  "sources": "Input parameters s, b, d, i from the request query string.",
  "sinks": "Return statement sends these parameters back to the client.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are received from the request; then they are returned directly without modification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple API GET endpoint that accepts four optional query parameters: a string, a boolean, a date, and an integer. These parameters are directly returned in a list. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The use of date parsing via the date type is standard and does not introduce security issues. No external or untrusted data manipulation, code injection, or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward API endpoint with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only echoes input parameters provided via the query string, which is typical for simple API functions.",
