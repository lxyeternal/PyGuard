  "purpose": "Define a schema for date input and an API endpoint to return events for a given date.",
  "sources": "The API endpoint extracts date parameters from the URL path; the PathDate schema receives year, month, day as integers.",
  "sinks": "The date.value() method constructs a datetime.date object from input parameters, which is used in the response.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (year, month, day) → PathDate schema → value() method → datetime.date object → API response.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No suspicious network activity or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data schema for date input and an API endpoint that returns the date in a JSON response. The schema enforces integer types for year, month, and day, and constructs a date object without external input beyond URL parameters. There are no external data sources, no data being sent elsewhere, and no suspicious or malicious logic. The code appears to be a straightforward API implementation without security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple API endpoint for returning a date; it does not contain malware or malicious behavior. No security issues or anomalies are detected.",
