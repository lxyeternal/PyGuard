{
  "purpose": "Provide a search endpoint for filtering a predefined list of weapons based on a query string.",
  "sources": "User input via the 'q' parameter in the request URL.",
  "sinks": "Filtering operation using 'q' to match weapon names, and returning the filtered list.",
  "flows": "User input ('q') is used in a list comprehension to filter weapons; no data is sent to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no malicious obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution. The code performs straightforward filtering.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static list of weapons and exposes a GET API endpoint '/weapons/search'. When a request is received with a 'q' parameter, it filters the list for items containing 'q' (case-insensitive). Pagination is handled via 'offset'. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden backdoors. The filtering logic is simple and does not involve unsafe operations. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign search feature with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is a straightforward implementation of a filtered list response based on user input.",
