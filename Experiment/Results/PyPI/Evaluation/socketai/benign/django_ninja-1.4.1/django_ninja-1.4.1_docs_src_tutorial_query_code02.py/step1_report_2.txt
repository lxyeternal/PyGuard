{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple API endpoint to search for weapons by name within a predefined list.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'q' received from the request query string.",
  "sinks": "The 'results' list being returned, which is based on the user input 'q' with no sanitization or validation.",
  "flows": "Input 'q' flows from the request into the list comprehension filtering 'weapons' list, then results are sliced and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual or suspicious code structures, no dynamic execution or obfuscation. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of weapons and an API GET endpoint that searches for weapon names containing the input 'q'. The search is case-insensitive. The data flow is simple: user input is used directly to filter a list, then a subset of results is returned. There are no external data sources, no insecure data handling, and no evident malicious behavior. The code appears to be a benign search implementation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic search API with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is straightforward and safe.",
