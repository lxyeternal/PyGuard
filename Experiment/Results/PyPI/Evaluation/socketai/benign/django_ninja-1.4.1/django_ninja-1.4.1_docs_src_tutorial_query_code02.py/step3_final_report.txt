  "purpose": "Provides a simple search API over a static list of weapons with pagination support.",
  "sources": "The 'q' query parameter used in the filter expression 'q in w.lower()'.",
  "sinks": "The filtering operation uses unvalidated user input directly in string containment check; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'q' flows directly into the substring check against each weapon name in the list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, external calls, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static list and a GET endpoint that filters this list based on a case-insensitive substring match with user input 'q'. No external network calls, credentials, or obfuscation are present. The filtering is simple and safe, with no evident malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The input 'q' is used directly in filtering, but given the static data and simple operation, this does not pose a security risk. The code is well-structured, and the logic is correct. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward search API over a static list, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
