  "purpose": "A simple API endpoint returning a static list of weapons with pagination support.",
  "sources": "The 'limit' and 'offset' parameters used directly in list slicing.",
  "sinks": "List slicing operation; no external or dangerous sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('limit', 'offset') flow into list slicing to determine returned subset.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static list and an API GET endpoint that slices this list based on 'limit' and 'offset'. It does not perform dynamic code execution, external data handling, or contain obfuscation. The use of parameters in slicing is safe in Python assuming proper parsing by the framework. No malicious payloads or vulnerabilities are present. Minor robustness concern about lack of explicit validation for parameters, but this does not constitute a security issue.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and secure. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate given the simplicity and safety of the code.",
