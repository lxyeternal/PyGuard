{
  "purpose": "Provide an API endpoint that returns a list of weapons with optional pagination.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'limit' and 'offset' received from the request (query parameters).",
  "sinks": "Data returned from the list_weapons function; no direct data leak or unsafe operation observed.",
  "flows": "Request query parameters -> list_weapons function -> sliced weapons list -> API response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. Use of list slicing with user-controlled parameters is safe in Python.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static list of weapons and an API GET endpoint that returns a paginated slice of this list. The 'limit' and 'offset' parameters are used to control data returned, but they are standard query parameters. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, injection, or obfuscation. No external calls, no environment variable usage, and no suspicious behavior observed. The code appears straightforward and secure for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, clean, and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It provides a basic paginated list API endpoint with no apparent vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
