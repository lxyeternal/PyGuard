  "purpose": "Define a secure API endpoint for retrieving pet information with authentication.",
  "sources": "The code reads incoming HTTP requests and authentication tokens via the request object.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive information could be exposed if the request.auth is maliciously modified or mishandled, but in this context it just returns the auth info.",
  "flows": "Request is received -> Authentication is verified -> Response includes authenticated user info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward authentication.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a NinjaAPI for creating an API endpoint and uses django_auth for authentication. It defines a GET endpoint '/pets' that returns a string with the authenticated user's info. There are no suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors. The code relies on established libraries and standard practices for authentication. No external data sources or sinks pose security threats in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a simple, standard API endpoint with authentication. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and aligned with typical usage patterns.",
