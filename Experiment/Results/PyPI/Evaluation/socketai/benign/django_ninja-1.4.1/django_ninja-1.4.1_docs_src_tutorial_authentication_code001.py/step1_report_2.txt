  "purpose": "Define a simple authenticated API endpoint for retrieving pet information.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the HTTP request via the 'request' parameter in the 'pets' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'request.auth' data is returned in the response, potentially exposing authenticated user information.",
  "flows": "HTTP request -> 'pets' function (reads 'request' and 'request.auth') -> response containing 'request.auth'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code uses standard libraries and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'NinjaAPI' for creating API routes and 'django_auth' for authentication. It sets up an API with CSRF protection. The '/pets' endpoint requires authentication and returns a message including the 'request.auth' object. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leaks beyond the intended authentication info. The response leaks the 'request.auth' object, but that is consistent with authenticated API behavior, not necessarily malicious. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an authenticated API endpoint using Django and NinjaAPI. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain threats. The only potential concern is exposing 'request.auth', which may leak authenticated user info, but this is typical for debugging or informational endpoints. Overall, the code appears safe.",
