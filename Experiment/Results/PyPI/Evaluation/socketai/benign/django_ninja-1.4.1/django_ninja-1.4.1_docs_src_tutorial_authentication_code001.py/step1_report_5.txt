  "purpose": "Implementing a secure API endpoint for retrieving pet information with authentication.",
  "sources": "Imports from ninja package and usage of request.auth for authenticated user info.",
  "sinks": "Returning request.auth information, which could potentially expose authentication details if mishandled.",
  "flows": "Authenticated request passes through the /pets endpoint, returning user info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed. Use of csrf=True is standard for security.",
  "analysis": "The code imports NinjaAPI and django_auth, sets up an API with CSRF protection enabled, and defines a single GET endpoint /pets that requires authentication. The function returns the authenticated user's info, which is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behavior, or suspicious logic is present. The structure follows typical secure API patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to implement a straightforward, secure API endpoint with authentication. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
