  "purpose": "Define a schema for filtering events and provide an API endpoint to retrieve filtered events.",
  "sources": "Request parameters for 'limit', 'offset', 'query', and 'categories' through API query parameters.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code only processes and returns filter parameters without executing unsafe operations or handling untrusted data beyond parameter parsing.",
  "flows": "Input data from API query parameters flows into the 'Filters' schema, which is then converted to a dictionary and returned as part of the response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, and no obfuscated code detected. Usage of common libraries and straightforward data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data schema 'Filters' with parameters for filtering events. The endpoint '/filter' accepts query parameters matching the schema, converts the schema instance to a dictionary, and returns it. There are no apparent data leaks, unsafe code execution, or malicious behavior. The code uses standard library imports and well-known packages (pydantic, ninja). No input validation beyond schema enforcement, but that is typical for such API endpoints. No suspicious side-effects or backdoors observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a simple, standard API endpoint with parameter validation. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks within this snippet.",
