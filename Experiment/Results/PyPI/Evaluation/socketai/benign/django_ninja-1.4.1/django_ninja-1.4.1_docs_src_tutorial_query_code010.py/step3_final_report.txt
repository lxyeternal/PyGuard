  "purpose": "Defines a Pydantic schema for filtering parameters and an API GET endpoint that accepts these filters and returns them as a JSON object.",
  "sources": "Query parameters received via the API endpoint, validated by the Filters schema.",
  "sinks": "Returning filters.dict() as JSON; no dangerous sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Query parameters -> Validation via Filters schema -> filters.dict() -> JSON response.",
  "anomalies": "Default 'offset' set to None, which is unconventional but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API endpoint that accepts query parameters, validates them with Pydantic, and returns the parameters. No database, network, or file operations are present. The use of 'alias' for 'categories' is standard. The default 'offset=None' is unusual but not malicious. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are detected. The input validation is safe, and the data flow is simple and secure. Minor concern about 'offset=None' could cause runtime issues if downstream code expects an integer, but it does not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe API endpoint with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The scores of malware=0 and securityRisk=0 are appropriate. The minor securityRisk=0.1 in some reports reflects a potential handling concern with default values, not an actual vulnerability. Overall, the code is secure and well-structured.",
