  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code features detected; simple path parameter handling",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward FastAPI route handler that takes an 'item_id' from the URL path and returns it in a dictionary. There are no input sanitization, no database queries, and no external data transmission. No obfuscated code or malicious logic is present. The code appears standard and harmless.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple data echo endpoint with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
