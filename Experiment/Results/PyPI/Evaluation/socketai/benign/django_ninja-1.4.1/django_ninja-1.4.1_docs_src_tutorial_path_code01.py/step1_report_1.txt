  "purpose": "Define an API endpoint to retrieve item information based on item_id",
  "sources": "The 'item_id' parameter from the URL path",
  "sinks": "Returning 'item_id' directly in the JSON response",
  "flows": "Input 'item_id' -> output in response dictionary",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward parameter handling",
  "analysis": "The code defines a GET API endpoint using a decorator, capturing 'item_id' from the URL. It directly returns this 'item_id' in the response without any processing, validation, or sanitization. There are no external data sources, no use of environment variables, no code injection, and no malicious behavior. The code appears minimal and standard for a REST API route. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. No obfuscation or unusual language features are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple API route handler that returns a provided item_id without any malicious intent or security risks. It performs no harmful actions and has no suspicious behaviors.",
