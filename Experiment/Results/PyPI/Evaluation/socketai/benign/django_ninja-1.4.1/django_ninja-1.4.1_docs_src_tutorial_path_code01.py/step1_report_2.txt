  "purpose": "Define an API endpoint to retrieve an item by its ID",
  "sources": "The 'item_id' parameter from the URL path",
  "sinks": "Returning 'item_id' directly in the response",
  "flows": "Input 'item_id' from the request to the response without validation or modification",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious imports or logic",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple API GET endpoint that extracts 'item_id' from the URL and returns it in a JSON object. There is no input validation, sanitization, or processing that could lead to code injection or data leakage. No external or untrusted data sources are involved, nor are there any suspicious behaviors or anomalies such as hidden backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns. The code structure is straightforward and minimal, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic API endpoint with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply returns the provided 'item_id' parameter, which by itself does not indicate any security concern.",
