  "purpose": "Define an API endpoint to retrieve an item by its ID",
  "sources": "Path parameter 'item_id' from the URL",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs 'item_id' directly in the response",
  "flows": "Input 'item_id' flows from URL parameter to response data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. No obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple GET endpoint '/items/{item_id}' using an API decorator. It takes 'item_id' from the URL path and returns it in a JSON response. There is no processing of the input that could lead to injection or data leaks. No external network activity, no use of environment variables, and no other suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and standard for defining a REST API endpoint.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic API route handler with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply echoes the provided 'item_id'. There are no anomalies or signs of malicious behavior.",
