  "purpose": "A minimal API GET endpoint that retrieves an item_id from the URL and returns it in a JSON response.",
  "sources": "The URL path parameter 'item_id' as input data.",
  "sinks": "Returning 'item_id' directly in the JSON response, which could expose identifiers.",
  "flows": "Input 'item_id' from URL -> function returns {'item_id': item_id} -> response sent to client.",
  "anomalies": "No validation or sanitization of 'item_id'; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. It simply echoes back a URL parameter. The potential concern is data exposure, but this is a design consideration, not a security vulnerability. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores (0 to 0.2). The scores are consistent with the code's behavior. No anomalies or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal API endpoint with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The slight security risk relates to data exposure, which is typical in such endpoints but not a security flaw. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low risk score (~0.1) are appropriate.",
