  "purpose": "Django factory utilities for model creation, file/image handling, and signal management in testing environments.",
  "sources": "Model definitions, file paths, file objects, functions for content, environment variables for passwords, signals for muting.",
  "sinks": "Model instances saved to database, files saved or generated, signals muted/restored, password hashes generated.",
  "flows": "Input parameters or files -> content/file creation -> model save or get_or_create -> signal muting/restoring during tests.",
  "anomalies": "Manipulation of internal Django signal internals, use of PIL for image generation, no hardcoded secrets or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of testing utilities for Django, including model retrieval, file/image content generation, password hashing, and signal muting. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. Signal muting manipulates internal Django internals but is a documented testing pattern. File handling is based on reading files or generating images with PIL, which is standard. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are detected. The code operates within expected patterns for testing utilities, with low security risk due to internal signal manipulation but no active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility for Django testing purposes. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low risk score reflects internal signal handling but is acceptable in testing contexts. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's intent.",
