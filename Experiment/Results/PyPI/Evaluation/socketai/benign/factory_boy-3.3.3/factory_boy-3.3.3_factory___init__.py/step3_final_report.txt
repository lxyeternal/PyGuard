{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package's initialization module, importing core components and optional dependencies, and retrieving the package version.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, importlib.metadata.version() for version info, optional framework modules within try-except blocks.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network activity, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or external data processing; static imports and version retrieval only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Optional dependencies are handled gracefully.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static module for package setup, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks. Optional dependencies are imported within try-except blocks, which is common practice. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present. The author metadata and version retrieval are standard. The overall structure and content are benign and typical for a Python package's __init__.py or core module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured package initialization script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores across the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0. The risk score should be very low, around 0 to 0.1, considering the optional dependencies but no actual risk present.",
