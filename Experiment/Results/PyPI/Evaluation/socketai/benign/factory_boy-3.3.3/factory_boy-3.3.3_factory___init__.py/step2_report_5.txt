  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, cross-check the code and reasoning, and determine appropriate scores and insights.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a package init script, primarily handling imports and version retrieval, with no malicious activity detected.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that the code is static, standard, and lacks suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The high risk score (0.9) seems somewhat overestimated given the code's nature. It is a straightforward initialization script with no active logic, no data flow, and no external effects. The confidence is high, but the risk should be lower.\n\n**Recommendation:** Reduce the risk score to around 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static imports, version retrieval, and no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Correct, straightforward, and standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is an import and metadata setup with optional dependencies.\n- **Analysis:** Well-reasoned, noting no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) for a simple import script is probably unwarranted. It does include optional dependencies for frameworks, but these are standard and pose no risk.\n\n**Recommendation:** Adjust risk score to 0, as the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—standard package init code, optional dependencies, no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Correct, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar, with detailed description of the imports and optional dependencies.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, so 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** For such a static, import-only module, the risk should be minimal. High scores like 0.9 are unjustified; a more accurate assessment would be around 0.1 or lower.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects that the code is standard, safe, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only minor concern might be the inclusion of optional dependencies, but these are common and do not introduce security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent in their assessment that the code is benign. The only point to adjust is the risk score in the first report, which should be lowered from 0.9 to approximately 0.1. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set at 0 across all reports.",
