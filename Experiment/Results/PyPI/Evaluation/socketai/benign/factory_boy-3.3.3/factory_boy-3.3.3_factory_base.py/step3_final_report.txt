  "purpose": "A factory framework for creating, stubbing, and managing object instances with support for strategies and dynamic class handling.",
  "sources": "Class attributes, method parameters, imports, and declarations within factory classes.",
  "sinks": "Object instantiation via class calls, attribute access, and dynamic method invocation.",
  "flows": "Sources flow into object creation methods (_build, _create, stub), with dynamic class calls like model_class(*args, **kwargs).",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic class instantiation which could be exploited if inputs are malicious; no external network, file, or system operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard factory pattern with meta-programming, dynamic class creation, and flexible options. No network, file, or environment manipulation is present. The dynamic invocation (model_class(*args, **kwargs)) is typical but could be risky if external inputs are untrusted. No obfuscation or hidden malicious code is evident. The overall structure is clear, and the code appears intended for testing, data generation, or object management. The potential security concern is the misuse of dynamic object creation with untrusted data, but within the code, no malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured factory implementation with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The slight risk associated with dynamic class calls is inherent to such frameworks but does not constitute malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.",
