  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured factory implementation with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The slight risk associated with dynamic class calls is inherent to such frameworks but does not constitute malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2."
