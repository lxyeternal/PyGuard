The scores across the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0. The risk score should be very low, around 0 to 0.1, considering the optional dependencies but no actual risk present."

The potential misuse of add_provider is a known extension point but does not constitute an inherent security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.1, reflecting a minimal, acceptable concern."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign factory utility module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The dynamic class creation is typical for such utilities and does not indicate malicious behavior. The scores from the reports are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the security risk is low (~0.1-0.2) due to the potential for misuse if combined with malicious inputs, which is not the case here."

The primary concern is the security of the 'random' module used, which should be verified if used in security-critical contexts. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
