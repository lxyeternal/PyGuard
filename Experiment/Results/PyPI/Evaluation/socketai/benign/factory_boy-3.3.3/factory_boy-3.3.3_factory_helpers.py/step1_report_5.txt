{
  "purpose": "The code provides wrapper functions for creating, building, and generating instances of classes using factory patterns, along with some attribute declarations.",
  "sources": "Import statements, function parameters (klass, kwargs, strategy, size), and internal method calls.",
  "sinks": "Calls to make_factory, which dynamically creates factory classes; use of build, create, generate methods that instantiate or generate objects.",
  "flows": "Input class and parameters -> make_factory creates factory class -> build/create/generate methods instantiate objects or batches.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors observed. The code relies on external modules and dynamic class creation but does not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for factory pattern implementation, dynamically creating classes and instantiating objects. It uses standard Python features such as type creation, context managers, and attribute declarations. There are no indications of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious payloads. The dynamic class creation is normal for factory libraries but does not pose a malicious threat by itself. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies such as obfuscation, code injection, or hidden code were detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward factory pattern implementation with utility functions for object creation and attribute declarations. No malicious intent or suspicious activities are evident. It is a standard, well-structured utility module with no security concerns.",
