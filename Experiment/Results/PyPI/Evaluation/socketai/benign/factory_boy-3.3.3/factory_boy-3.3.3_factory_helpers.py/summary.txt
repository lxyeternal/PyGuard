  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign factory utility module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The dynamic class creation is typical for such utilities and does not indicate malicious behavior. The scores from the reports are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the security risk is low (~0.1-0.2) due to the potential for misuse if combined with malicious inputs, which is not the case here."
