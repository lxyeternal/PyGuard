  "purpose": "Utility classes for generating fuzzy/random test data such as strings, numbers, and dates for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are internal parameters; no external data or user input is read.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data exfiltration points; no network or file output observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class parameters through internal methods to generated random values; no external data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom 'random' module (.random) which is not shown; seed warnings indicate non-determinism but are standard for test data generators.",
  "analysis": "The code provides classes for generating various types of random data, relying on an imported 'random' object. It performs no network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation. The seed warnings are standard and do not suggest malicious intent. The reliance on an external 'random' module could be a concern if insecure, but no evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities is present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and intended solely for testing data generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for creating fuzzy test data with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The primary concern is the security of the 'random' module used, which should be verified if used in security-critical contexts. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
