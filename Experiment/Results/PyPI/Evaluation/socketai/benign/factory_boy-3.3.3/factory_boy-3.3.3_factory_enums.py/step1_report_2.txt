  "purpose": "Define constants and classes related to build strategies and phases in a factory or builder pattern.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leak points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard, defining constants and a class with class attributes; no unusual or suspicious code behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines string constants for build strategies, a splitter string, and a class representing build phases with class attributes. The get_builder_phase function retrieves a specific attribute from an object, defaulting to None. The overall structure and content are straightforward and typical for configuration or state representation in a factory pattern. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears safe and standard for its apparent purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign configuration/setup component for a factory or builder pattern. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
