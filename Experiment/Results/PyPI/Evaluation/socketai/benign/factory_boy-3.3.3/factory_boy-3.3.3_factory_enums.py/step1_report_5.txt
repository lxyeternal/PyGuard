  "purpose": "Define constants and classes related to build strategies and phases for a factory or builder pattern.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data output or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; the code does not process or transfer untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and declarative, defining constants and a class.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for build strategies and a splitter string, along with a class 'BuilderPhase' that encapsulates different phases of a build process. The function 'get_builder_phase' retrieves an attribute from an object, which could be used in larger code to determine current build phase. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. Overall, this appears to be boilerplate code for a builder pattern, with no malicious or suspicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, declarative, and appears to serve as part of a larger framework for object creation or factory pattern management. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
