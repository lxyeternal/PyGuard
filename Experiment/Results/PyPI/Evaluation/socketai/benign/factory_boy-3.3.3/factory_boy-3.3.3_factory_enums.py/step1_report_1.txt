  "purpose": "Define constants and a class related to build strategies and phases in a factory or builder pattern.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions, class attribute access via get_builder_phase function",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the function simply retrieves an attribute value",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed",
  "analysis": "The code sets up constants for build strategies and phases, and defines a class with phase identifiers. The get_builder_phase function retrieves an attribute value from an object. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward utility module for a factory pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily defining constants and a simple attribute retrieval function with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
