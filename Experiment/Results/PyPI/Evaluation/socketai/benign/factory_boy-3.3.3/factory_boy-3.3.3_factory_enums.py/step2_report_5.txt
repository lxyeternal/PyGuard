  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and security risks, and verify the consistency of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of constant definitions, a class with class attributes, and a simple attribute retrieval function.\n- No external input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data flow from untrusted sources.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The code appears to be boilerplate or configuration for a factory or builder pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**Report 1-5 common points:**\n\n- **Purpose:** All describe defining constants and a class related to build phases/strategies.\n- **Sources & sinks:** No external data or untrusted data sinks.\n- **Flows:** No data flow from untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** All agree the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- **confidence:** 1 (high confidence the code is benign)\n- **obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **malware:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **securityRisk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThese scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or discrepancies:\n\n- The reports are consistent; no suspicious claims or assumptions are made.\n- The function `get_builder_phase` simply retrieves an attribute; no risk there.\n- The constants and class are standard and do not pose security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I agree with the provided scores. The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the true nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is safe, straightforward, and serves as configuration/setup.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- No evidence of supply chain risk or malware.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security issues or malicious intent.",
