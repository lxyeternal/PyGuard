{
  "purpose": "Define build strategies, a string splitter, and a class for managing build phases in a factory or builder pattern.",
  "sources": "Constants and class definitions; no input reading or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static configuration variables and a class with class attributes for managing build phases. The function get_builder_phase retrieves an attribute from an object, defaulting to None. No external data handling, user input, or system modification code is present. The code appears straightforward and benign, serving as part of a larger factory or builder pattern implementation. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard configuration and utility class without any malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be safe and unrelated to supply chain attacks or malware.",
