  "purpose": "Defines constants and a class for build strategies and phases, along with a utility function to retrieve build phase attribute from objects.",
  "sources": "Retrieving the 'FACTORY_BUILDER_PHASE' attribute from objects via get_builder_phase()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the function only reads an attribute",
  "flows": "Source: get_builder_phase() reading attribute; sink: none, as no data is written or transmitted",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static constants and straightforward attribute access, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility module with constants, a class, and a function to retrieve an attribute. No dynamic code, external inputs, network activity, or secrets are present. The code is static and declarative, serving configuration purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The function safely retrieves an attribute without executing or processing untrusted data. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard utility code for managing build phases within a factory pattern. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores and assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
