{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and a class related to build strategies and phases, likely part of a factory or builder pattern implementation.",
  "sources": "Constants and class definitions; no input or data reading functions present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; code is purely defining constants and a class.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple constant definitions, a class with class attributes, and a function that retrieves an attribute from an object. There is no dynamic code execution, external data input, or network communication. It appears to be a straightforward part of a larger codebase related to object building or factory patterns. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a configuration or structural component for a factory or builder system. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected.",
