  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only imports and calls setup()",
  "sinks": "The setup() function does not process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; it is used for package installation",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the script simply invokes setup() with no parameters",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the script is minimal and standard for package setup",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical minimal setup script for Python packaging using setuptools. It imports the setup function and calls it without any arguments, which is a common practice when default parameters are sufficient. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard setup script for packaging Python modules, with no anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
