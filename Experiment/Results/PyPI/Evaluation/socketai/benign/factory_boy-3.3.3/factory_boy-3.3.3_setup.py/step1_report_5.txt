  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for packaging the Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; only imports and function calls within the script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the script does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The script imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls setup() with no parameters, which is straightforward and standard.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.",
