{
  "purpose": "To serve a specified file over HTTP with download count tracking.",
  "sources": "Reading the file specified by 'path_to_file' from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Serving the file content in HTTP responses; exposing download count via an endpoint.",
  "flows": "File is read from disk -> HTTP response serves the file content -> download count is incremented and can be retrieved via an endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious external connections, no unusual behavior. The code reads a local file and serves it over HTTP; this is typical server functionality.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a web server that serves a specified file from disk. It tracks how many times the file is downloaded and exposes this count through a dedicated endpoint. The file path is supplied via command-line arguments or environment variables. No user input is directly incorporated into responses in a malicious way. The server listens indefinitely, offering file download and download count endpoints. The code does not include any network connections other than serving local HTTP requests, and it does not perform any suspicious actions such as data exfiltration, executing arbitrary code, or interacting with external malicious domains.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward file server with download counting. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a simple, legitimate file-serving script with no hidden behaviors.",
