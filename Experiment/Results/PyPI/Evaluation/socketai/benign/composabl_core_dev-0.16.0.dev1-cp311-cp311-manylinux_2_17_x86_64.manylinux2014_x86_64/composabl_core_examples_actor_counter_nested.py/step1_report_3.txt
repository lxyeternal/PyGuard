{
  "purpose": "The code defines two classes, DemoCounterNested and DemoCounterActorNested, which manage simple integer counters with getter and setter methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only initializes and manipulates internal class variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or outputs that could leak data or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the classes simply hold and update internal state without external data interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present. The copyright comments indicate proprietary status but do not influence code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The classes are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, network communication, or external data handling. The getter and setter methods operate on internal state only. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators in the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, non-malicious implementation of counter classes with no security risks or malware indications.",
