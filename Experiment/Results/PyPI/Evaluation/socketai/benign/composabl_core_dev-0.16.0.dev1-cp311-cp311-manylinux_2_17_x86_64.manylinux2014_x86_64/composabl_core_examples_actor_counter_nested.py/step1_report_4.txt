{
  "purpose": "The code defines two classes, DemoCounterNested and DemoCounterActorNested, each managing a counter value with getter and setter methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from constructor parameters and setter methods, which set the counter value.",
  "sinks": "The getter methods return the counter value; setter methods update the counter. No external untrusted sources or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Counter value is set via set_counter and retrieved via get_counter; no external data flow or external sinks are identified.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated parts, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns. The comments suggest proprietary restrictions, but nothing suspicious is embedded in logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions with basic getter and setter methods. There are no external inputs, no network or file I/O, and no complex logic. The comments indicate proprietary rights, but do not imply malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, innocuous class definitions for managing a counter. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
