{
  "purpose": "The code defines two classes for managing counters, likely for application state or simple tracking.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions are present that could lead to data leaks or untrusted data effects.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only manages internal state via setter and getter methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright and confidentiality notice, but no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining two classes with basic attribute management for a counter. There are no external data inputs, no network communication, and no security-sensitive operations. The classes seem to serve simple internal purposes without any malicious intent or dangerous functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign, simple, and with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a larger, harmless application.",
