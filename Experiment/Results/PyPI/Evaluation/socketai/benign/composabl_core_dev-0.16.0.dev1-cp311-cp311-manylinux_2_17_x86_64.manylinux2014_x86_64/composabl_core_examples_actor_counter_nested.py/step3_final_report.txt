{
  "purpose": "Simple classes managing an internal counter with getter and setter methods, no external input or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, class attributes accessed via methods",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input processed",
  "flows": "Constructor assigns to self.counter; get_counter returns self.counter; set_counter updates self.counter",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two classes with basic counter management. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The logic is simple and transparent. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code's purpose appears to be internal state management, with no external interactions or complex logic. The uniform assessment across reports aligns with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of counter classes with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and minimal security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
