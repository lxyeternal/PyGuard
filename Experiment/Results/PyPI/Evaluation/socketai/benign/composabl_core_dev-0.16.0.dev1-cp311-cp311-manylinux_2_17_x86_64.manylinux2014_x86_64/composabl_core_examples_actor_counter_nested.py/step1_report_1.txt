{
  "purpose": "Defines two simple classes for managing counters with getter and setter methods.",
  "sources": "No input sources; no data reading beyond class instantiation and method calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "Object creation and method calls to get or set counter values; no external data flow or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscation, and no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two straightforward classes with simple counter management. Both classes only assign and retrieve an integer value. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, and no suspicious behaviors like network activity, file operations, or environment manipulation. The code appears to be purely for internal state management with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It serves as a basic counter management implementation without external dependencies or unsafe operations.",
