  "purpose": "Initialize and run an asynchronous server with configurable parameters, including environment setup.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments and environment variables, specifically 'args.env_init' which is processed via eval().",
  "sinks": "eval() on 'args.env_init' which executes arbitrary code if input is malicious.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line or environment variables flows into 'args.env_init', then into eval(), executing code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on user-controlled input without validation, allowing potential arbitrary code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a server with parameters from environment and CLI. The critical flaw is the use of eval() on 'args.env_init', which can execute malicious code if input is crafted. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious network activity is evident. The server runs indefinitely after startup. The eval() usage is the main security concern, representing a high risk of remote code execution. The code itself is straightforward and lacks obfuscation. The malware score should be high due to eval() vulnerability, but current assessments assign low malware scores. The security risk is significant because eval() on untrusted input can lead to remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious but contains a critical security vulnerability through unsafe eval() usage. This flaw could allow remote code execution if exploited. No malware or obfuscation is present. The overall security risk is high, warranting a malware score around 0.8, an obfuscated score of 0, and a risk score close to 0.8–0.9. Immediate mitigation involves replacing eval() with safer parsing methods to prevent exploitation.",
