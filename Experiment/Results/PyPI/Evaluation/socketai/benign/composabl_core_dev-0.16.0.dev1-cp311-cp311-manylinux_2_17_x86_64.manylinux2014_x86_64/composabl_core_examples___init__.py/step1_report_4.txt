{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports several submodules related to demos and simulations, likely for a larger application or framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules (.demo, .demo_coordinated_set, .demo_coordinated_population, .rocket_landing, .multi_walker).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no functions or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules but does not perform data flow or processing within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains import statements with no additional logic; no suspicious or unusual behavior observed. The comment mentions proprietary rights, but this is common in proprietary code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a series of import statements from local modules, indicating modular design. The comments declare proprietary rights but do not influence execution security. There are no suspicious patterns, code injections, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. Since the code does not include executable logic beyond imports, it poses minimal security risk. The presence of proprietary comments and relative imports does not inherently suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It seems to be part of a proprietary, modular system. No malware or security risks detected.",
