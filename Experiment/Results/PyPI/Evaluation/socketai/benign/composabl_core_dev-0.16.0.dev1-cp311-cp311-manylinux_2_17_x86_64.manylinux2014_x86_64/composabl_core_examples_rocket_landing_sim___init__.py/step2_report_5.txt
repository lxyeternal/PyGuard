  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the provided code snippets are purely comments containing copyright and proprietary notices.\n   - There are no executable statements, data flows, or input/output operations present in any of the snippets.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious code, or signs of obfuscation are detected.\n\n2. **Scores Consistency and Justification:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the fact that these are just comments with no executable code or malicious indicators.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the content being non-executable and purely legal notices.\n\n3. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly interpret the code as non-malicious and non-obfuscated.\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code snippet.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent that are unfounded.\n\n4. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The reports are accurate and consistent with the code content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary for scores or conclusions.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Given the nature of the code, the scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk should remain at 0.\n- The confidence should stay at 1, as the analysis is straightforward and conclusive.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe provided code snippets are purely legal notices with no executable or malicious content. The reports are accurate, and no further action is needed.",
