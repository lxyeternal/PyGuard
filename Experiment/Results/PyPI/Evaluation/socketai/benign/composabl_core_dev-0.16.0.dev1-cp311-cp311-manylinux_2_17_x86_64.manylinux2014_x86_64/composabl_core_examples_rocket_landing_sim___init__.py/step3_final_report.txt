  "anomalies": "No anomalies; only comments with copyright and proprietary notices",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments with legal notices, containing no executable statements, data input/output, or suspicious patterns. The absence of code logic, data handling, or obfuscation indicates no security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only legal notices with no executable or malicious content. It poses no security threat, and the scores accurately reflect this.",
