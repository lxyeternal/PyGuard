  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\nFirst, all reports identify the code as solely consisting of comments—specifically copyright and proprietary notices—with no executable code, data flows, or suspicious patterns. The analysis in each case confirms that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code snippets are purely comments with no executable content.\n- No data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The confidence scores are all at 1, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the snippets.\n- The malware scores are all 0, aligning with the absence of any malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which is consistent with the above.\n\n**Scores Review:**\n- The \"obfuscated\" scores are 0, which makes sense because comments cannot be obfuscated code.\n- The \"malware\" scores are 0, correctly reflecting no malicious behavior.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are 0, as expected.\n\n**Logical Consistency & Reasoning:**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No claims are based on assumptions; all conclusions are appropriate given the code.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The provided scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware score: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- Obfuscated score: 0 (comments are not obfuscated code)\n- Risk score: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:**\nGiven the data, this is a benign code snippet consisting solely of legal notices. No further action or concern is warranted.",
