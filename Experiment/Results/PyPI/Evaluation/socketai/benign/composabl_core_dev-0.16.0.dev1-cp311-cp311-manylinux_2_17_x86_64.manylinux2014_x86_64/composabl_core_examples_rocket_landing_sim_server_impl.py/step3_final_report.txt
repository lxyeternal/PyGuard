{
  "purpose": "Server interface for a Lunar Lander environment, managing environment creation, reset, step, rendering, and info queries.",
  "sources": "Environment initialization, reset, step, and rendering functions; print statement during environment creation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data transmission; environment interactions are local.",
  "flows": "Input actions to environment step; environment outputs to sensors, info, reward, termination flags.",
  "anomalies": "Benign print statement for environment creation; comment about gymnasium version hack, which is non-exploitative.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around a gymnasium environment with no malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation. The print statement is benign, and no secrets or external data handling are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe environment interface with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
