{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a server-side interface for controlling a Lunar Lander environment, including environment creation, sensor/action space queries, reset, step, and rendering functions.",
  "sources": "Environment parameters, environment actions, and internal environment state (e.g., env_id, env_init, env).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data flow to external systems or network activities in the code.",
  "flows": "Input actions flow into env.step(); env_init flows into environment creation; environment state flows into sensor_space_info, action_space_info, and get_render.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statement for logging; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious variable manipulation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing a Lunar Lander environment, with functions for setup, reset, step, rendering, and environment info queries. It imports standard and third-party libraries (gymnasium, numpy), and interacts with a custom environment (LunarLander). There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution. The use of print for debugging is typical. The code appears to be a standard environment wrapper with no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a server environment interface for a Lunar Lander simulation. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The security risk is minimal, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malware. The overall confidence in this assessment is high.",
