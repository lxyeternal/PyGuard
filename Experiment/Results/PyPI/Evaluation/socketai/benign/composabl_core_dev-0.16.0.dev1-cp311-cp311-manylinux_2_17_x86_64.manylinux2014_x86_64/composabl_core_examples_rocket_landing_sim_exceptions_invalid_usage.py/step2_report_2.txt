  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a straightforward custom exception class `InvalidUsage`.\n- No external data sources, no untrusted data handling, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The code appears standard for web applications, with no obfuscation, malware, or security risks noted.\n- The reports' conclusions are consistent and justified based on the code provided.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is correctly implementing a custom exception class with optional payload and message.\n- No issues are present in the code logic, structure, or security posture.\n- The code does not read external input, process untrusted data, or perform any network or file operations.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- None identified. The code is simple, clean, and standard.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 is appropriate. No vulnerabilities or risky patterns are present.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- All scores are zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- No reason to increase any scores based on the provided code.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- The reports correctly identify that this is a standard exception class with no malicious intent.\n- No external context suggests malicious use.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the report descriptions and the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe, and well-structured exception class with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, and the reports are accurate. No modifications to scores are necessary.",
