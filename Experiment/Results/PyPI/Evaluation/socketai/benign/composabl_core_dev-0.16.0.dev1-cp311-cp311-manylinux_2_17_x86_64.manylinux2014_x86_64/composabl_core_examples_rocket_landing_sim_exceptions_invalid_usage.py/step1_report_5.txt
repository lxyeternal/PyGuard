  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling invalid usage errors with optional payload and status code.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; the code defines a class for exception handling within a larger application.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external output mechanisms are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no source-to-sink data flows in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright notice claiming proprietary rights and restrictions, but no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. The exception class is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class named 'InvalidUsage' with an attribute for status code and payload. The constructor allows setting a message, status code, and optional payload. The 'to_dict' method converts the payload to a dictionary and adds the message. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or malicious data handling. The only notable aspect is the proprietary copyright notice, which does not affect code security.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard custom exception class used for application error handling. There are no malicious behaviors, supply chain threats, or security risks present.",
