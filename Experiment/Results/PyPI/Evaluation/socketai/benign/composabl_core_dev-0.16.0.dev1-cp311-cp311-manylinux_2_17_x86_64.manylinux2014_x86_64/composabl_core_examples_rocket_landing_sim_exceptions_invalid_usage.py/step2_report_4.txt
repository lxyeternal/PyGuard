  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward custom exception class intended for error handling.\n- No external data sources, malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The code is standard, with no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- The code does not process or output untrusted data, nor does it contain any dynamic or external code execution.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code's purpose is clear: define an exception class with optional payload and message, suitable for API error responses.\n- The 'to_dict' method serializes payload and message into a dictionary, which is typical for error responses.\n- The proprietary comment does not impact security.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence is 1, which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- No changes are necessary to the scoring.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- Since the code is a standard exception class with no external input handling, the risk of supply chain attack or malicious behavior is negligible.\n- The only aspect to note is the proprietary copyright notice, which does not influence security.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is safe, non-malicious, and free from obfuscation.\n- The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are accurate and should remain unchanged.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code snippet poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concern. It is a standard, well-structured exception class suitable for use in web applications.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments are needed.",
