  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling invalid usage errors in a web application.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code reads no input or data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; the code does not lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "The class initializes with message, payload, and optional status_code; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; straightforward class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard custom exception class with no external dependencies, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. The proprietary comments do not impact security. The class provides error handling functionality typical in web applications, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security risks. It is a standard exception class with no malicious or obfuscated features. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk should all be 0, consistent with the analysis.",
