  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines a class `InvalidUsage` inheriting from `Exception`.\n- Has a `status_code` default of 400.\n- Constructor allows setting `message`, optional `status_code`, and optional `payload`.\n- Method `to_dict()` serializes `payload` and `message` into a dictionary.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward, standard for web error handling.\n- No external data sources, no data flows from untrusted sources, no obfuscation.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  No. The code is a standard exception class with no suspicious or malicious constructs.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No apparent errors. The implementation is correct and typical.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0  \n  These are reasonable given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific observations:\n- The **confidence** in all reports is 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The **anomalies** noted are mostly proprietary comments, which do not impact security.\n- The **analysis** across reports is consistent: the code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- **Supply chain concern?**  \n  Since the code is a simple class definition with no external dependencies or dynamic code execution, supply chain risk is minimal.\n- **Malware or obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is clear and does not contain obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Security risk?**  \n  Zero. The code is a typical error handling class.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**These scores are consistent with the code and reports.**\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The proprietary comments do not indicate malicious intent.\n- The code could be part of a larger application, but in isolation, it is benign.\n- No evidence of supply chain attack vectors or malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assigned scores. The code is standard, secure, and free from obfuscation or malware. The scores should remain at:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**No changes necessary.**",
