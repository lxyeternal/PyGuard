  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling invalid usage errors within an application.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from source to sink is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not contain any suspicious or unusual constructs; no hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class 'InvalidUsage' with a default HTTP status code of 400. It allows setting a message, an optional status code, and optional payload data. The 'to_dict' method serializes the payload and message into a dictionary for response purposes. The code structure is standard, with no evidence of obfuscated, malicious, or maliciously designed constructs. No external data sources or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class definition with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be intended for error handling within a web application.",
