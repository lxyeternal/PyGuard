  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines a class `InvalidUsage` inheriting from `Exception`.\n- Has attributes: `status_code` (default 400), `message`, and `payload`.\n- Constructor initializes these attributes.\n- Method `to_dict()` serializes `payload` and `message` into a dictionary.\n\n**Security and Malware Assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward custom exception class, commonly used in web applications.\n- No external data input, no data processing, no output handling, no code injection, or dynamic execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.\n- Proprietary comments do not impact security.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior or malicious payloads.\n\n**Review of the Reports:**\n- All reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- Confidence scores are 1 across all reports, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are 0, consistent with the absence of malicious patterns.\n- Security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.\n\n**Potential Issues or Inconsistencies:**\n- The reports do not identify any vulnerabilities or security risks.\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent.\n- No claims are made about obfuscation or malware that are unsupported by the code.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- Since the code is a simple exception class with no external dependencies, data flows, or suspicious features, the malware score should remain 0.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, as there's no evident risk.\n\n**My Overall Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard exception class with no malicious or obfuscated features.\n- The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are justified.\n- No further action required.",
