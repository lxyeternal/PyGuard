{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class 'InvalidUsage' for handling HTTP 400 errors with additional message, payload, and status code information.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code segment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output points involving untrusted data; the code only manages exception data.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external input to sensitive sinks; exception handling is self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of proprietary/confidential comments, but no suspicious or malicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The class 'InvalidUsage' extends Exception to include a message, optional status code, and payload. The constructor initializes these attributes, and 'to_dict' method converts payload and message into a dictionary for response formatting. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive operations. The code appears to be a standard custom exception implementation for web error handling. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class intended for error reporting in a web application. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and is standard in design. No security issues are present.",
