  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class 'InvalidUsage' for handling specific error cases, likely in a web application or API.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "targets": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as no input or output operations are performed.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only class and method definitions without any suspicious or unusual constructs. The comments are proprietary and do not suggest malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with attributes for status code, message, and payload. It includes an initializer to set these attributes and a method to convert the exception data to a dictionary. There are no input handling, external communications, or malicious code patterns present. The class appears to be part of a larger application for error handling and does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of a custom exception class for application error handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present in this snippet.",
