  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a straightforward custom exception class, intended for error handling in a web application.\n- It does not read external data, process untrusted input, or perform any network or file operations.\n- The class is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs.\n- The proprietary comments do not influence security considerations.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### Presence of issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct and performs as intended.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious intent, malware, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation.\n- **Supply chain risk:** The code is a simple class definition with no external dependencies or dynamic code execution.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard, and secure.\n\n---\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Justification:**\n- All reports correctly assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores as 0.\n- No evidence suggests any threat or malicious intent.\n- The code's purpose is solely to define an exception class for error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be 0, as the code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, as there are no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The high confidence (1) assigned in all reports is appropriate.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n- The reasoning in each report aligns with the code's actual content.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe exception class with no security concerns.",
