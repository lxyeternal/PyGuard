  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting strings into various case formats such as uppercase, lowercase, capital case, camel case, snake case, spinal case, and pascal case.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided as arguments to functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs to external systems observed.",
  "flows": "Input string -> case conversion functions (uplowcase, capitalcase, camelcase, etc.) -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No dynamic code execution or external network activity. Use of regex for string transformations is straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code implements string case conversion functions using regular expressions and string manipulations. All functions operate solely on provided input arguments, returning transformed strings without involving external data, system calls, or sensitive operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration. The code is simple and appears to serve purely formatting purposes. There are no apparent security risks or malicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code consists of basic string formatting utility functions with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It is safe and does not contain malware or suspicious activity.",
