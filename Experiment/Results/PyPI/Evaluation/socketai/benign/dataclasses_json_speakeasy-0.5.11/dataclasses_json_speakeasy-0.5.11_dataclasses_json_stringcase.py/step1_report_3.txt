{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for converting strings between various case formats such as uppercase, lowercase, capital case, camel case, snake case, spinal case, and pascal case.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'string' in each function, which is user-provided or external data.",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting the transformed string; no data is sent to external systems or network, and no files are read or written.",
  "flows": "Input 'string' is processed through regex substitutions and string manipulations within functions, with no external data flow or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string manipulation functions with clear, standard regex-based transformations. No external data sources, sinks, or malicious activities are present. The functions do not perform any network operations, file I/O, or environment variable access. The code appears to be a straightforward utility library for string case conversions, with proper documentation and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility library for string case transformations. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code snippet.",
