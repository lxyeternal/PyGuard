  "purpose": "Provides string case conversion functions (upper, lower, capital, camel, snake, spinal, pascal).",
  "sources": "Input strings to various conversion functions; user-provided data for string transformation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data in a harmful manner; functions simply manipulate strings and return results.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow through conversion functions and are transformed via regex substitutions and string operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network access, and no unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple string manipulation functions utilizing regex substitutions and string methods to convert strings into different cases. No external data sources, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present. The regex operations are straightforward, used solely for formatting. The functions do not contain any obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious logic. Overall, the code appears to be a harmless utility library for string case conversions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign utility for string case conversions with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
