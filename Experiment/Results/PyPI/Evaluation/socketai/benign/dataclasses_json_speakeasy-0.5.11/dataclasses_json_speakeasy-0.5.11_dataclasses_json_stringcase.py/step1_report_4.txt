{
  "purpose": "Provides string transformation functions such as case conversions (upper, lower, capital, camel, snake, spinal, pascal).",
  "sources": "User-provided input strings to be transformed by various functions.",
  "sinks": "None; the functions only manipulate strings and do not interact with external systems, files, or network.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through regex substitutions and string operations, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. All functions are straightforward string transformations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string manipulation functions using standard Python string methods and regex operations. There are no data leaks, external communications, or insecure operations. The functions are well-defined and perform common text transformations without side effects. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present. The code does not handle external input beyond the string arguments, and there is no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely functional with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a set of string formatting utilities with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
