  "purpose": "String case conversion utility functions for transforming input strings into various casing styles.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to each function as arguments.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network, or file I/O; functions operate solely on input data.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex/string methods -> transformed string (no external influence).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; functions perform standard string manipulations with regex.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple string transformation functions using regex and string methods, operating solely on input data. No external data sources, sinks, network activity, or system calls are present. The functions do not perform any malicious operations, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The regex patterns are standard for string formatting. The code is well-documented and straightforward, indicating a benign utility library. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward utility library for string case conversions with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
