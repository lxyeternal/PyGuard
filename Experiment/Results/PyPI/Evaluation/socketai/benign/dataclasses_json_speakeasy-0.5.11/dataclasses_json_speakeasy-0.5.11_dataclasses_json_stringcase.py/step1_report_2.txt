{
  "purpose": "The code provides various string transformation functions such as case conversions, camel case, snake case, spinal case, and pascal case formatting.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (strings). No external data sources or input mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed in a way that could cause security vulnerabilities such as code injection or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs (strings) through transformations to function outputs without any external influence or untrusted data affecting system behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. The regex patterns and string manipulations are standard for string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code implements string case conversion functions, each utilizing standard Python string methods and regex substitutions. No external input, network communication, or system commands are invoked. No code injection, data leakage, or other security issues are evident. The functions are purely computational and for formatting purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for string case conversions, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manipulates strings based on provided input parameters.",
