  "purpose": "Utility functions for type inspection, compatibility handling across Python versions, and safe attribute access, primarily supporting serialization and type validation frameworks.",
  "sources": "Class attributes (__args__, __origin__, __extra__, dataclass_json_config), system info (sys.version_info), external method calls (handle_from_dict, handle_to_dict, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No external data output, network, or file operations; internal attribute and type checks only.",
  "flows": "Type and attribute reads leading to conditional logic and method invocations based on class configs.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or hardcoded secrets; complex version-dependent logic is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of compatibility and type safety utility functions, handling Python version differences and safe attribute access. It performs type checks, extracts type arguments, converts timestamps, and manages undefined parameters via class configs. No network, file, or system commands are executed. The logic is thorough and exception-safe, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The functions are typical for serialization, validation, or type introspection frameworks, and their complexity is justified for cross-version support. No vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for internal type handling and compatibility, with no malware or malicious behavior detected. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk scores (0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
