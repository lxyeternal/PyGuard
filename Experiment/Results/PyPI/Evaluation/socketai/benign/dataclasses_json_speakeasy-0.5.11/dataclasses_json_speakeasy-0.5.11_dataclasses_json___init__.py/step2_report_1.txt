  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. The report correctly identifies that the code only performs benign import/export operations.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is also 0. No change needed.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate; the code is benign.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. The analysis confirms straightforward import statements with no malicious activity.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores?** Appropriate as 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is simple imports and exports, with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores?** Correctly set at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid and accurate.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. Same pattern of benign import/export code.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores?** Appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is standard module setup with no malicious activity.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores?** Correctly assigned.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores at 0.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.  \n- **Risk score:** All are at 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.  \n\n### Final expert evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, harmless module import/export pattern from a well-known library. No malicious, obfuscated, or security risks are evident. The reports are consistent and accurate.",
