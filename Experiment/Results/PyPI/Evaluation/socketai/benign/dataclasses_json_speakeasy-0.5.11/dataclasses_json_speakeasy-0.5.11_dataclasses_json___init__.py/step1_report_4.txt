  "purpose": "This code imports components from the 'dataclasses_json' library to facilitate JSON serialization/deserialization with dataclasses in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dataclasses_json' modules: api, cfg, undefined, and __version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this is purely import statements defining module interfaces",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs detected; straightforward imports and exports",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a well-known library 'dataclasses_json' and setting __all__ for module exports. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module interface definition with standard library imports. No malicious intent or security risks detected.",
