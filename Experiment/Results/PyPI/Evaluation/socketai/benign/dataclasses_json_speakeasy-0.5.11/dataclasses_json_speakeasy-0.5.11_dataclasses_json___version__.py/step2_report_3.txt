  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Confirms the code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious behavior.  \n- No input, data flow, or suspicious code.  \n- Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid, accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the standard practice of replacing version during deployment.  \n- No issues found.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Same core logic: static version string, no malicious code.  \n- Mentions the comment about `from dataclasses_json import __version__` as unrelated, which is accurate.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Same as above, with the note that the comment about `from dataclasses_json` is unrelated, which is correct.  \n- No suspicious activity.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Slightly notes that the comment about `from dataclasses_json` is unrelated, and that the version string is static.  \n- The confidence score is slightly lower (0.9), which is acceptable given the minor inconsistency in the comment.  \n- No malicious activity detected.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is a simple version placeholder, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The comments referencing `from dataclasses_json` are either unrelated or benign, and do not indicate any malicious intent.  \n- The code is static, with no data flows or external inputs.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a standard, harmless version declaration pattern used in many Python projects.",
