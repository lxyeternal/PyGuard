  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is just defining `__version__` with a placeholder value.\n- No data flows, no external inputs, no sinks.\n- The comment about replacing the version with a git tag is standard.\n- No suspicious behavior or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes that the code is static and standard.\n- No external data, no dynamic behavior.\n- The comment about replacing the version during deployment is typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion: straightforward version assignment.\n- The mention of `from dataclasses_json import __version__` in the comment seems unrelated but benign.\n- No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly more detailed but still only a static assignment.\n- The comment references `from dataclasses_json import __version__`, which is unrelated to the code but not malicious.\n- No dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, with a note about the comment referencing `dataclasses_json`, which is unrelated.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but the analysis remains consistent.\n- No malicious activity or security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple, static version placeholder.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- Comments referencing `dataclasses_json` are unrelated and benign.\n- The version is intended to be replaced during deployment, which is standard practice.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0, no security risk.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The scores given are consistent with the analysis.\n- The code is straightforward, with no suspicious activity.\n- The comments, while slightly confusing, do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code snippet poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concern.",
