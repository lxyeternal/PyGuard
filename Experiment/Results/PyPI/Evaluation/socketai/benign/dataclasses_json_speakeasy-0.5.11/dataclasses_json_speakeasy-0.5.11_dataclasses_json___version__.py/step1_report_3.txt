  "purpose": "Define and expose the version of the module/package.",
  "sources": "The __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external inputs; version string is static.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; version string is hardcoded, which is common, but no dynamic or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a __version__ variable to '0.0.0' with a comment indicating it will be replaced by a git tag during deployment. The purpose appears to be to define the package version. No user input, external data, or suspicious code is present. The comment referencing 'from dataclasses_json import __version__' seems unrelated to the code snippet but is a typical docstring indicating version handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. The code is straightforward and standard for version management.",
