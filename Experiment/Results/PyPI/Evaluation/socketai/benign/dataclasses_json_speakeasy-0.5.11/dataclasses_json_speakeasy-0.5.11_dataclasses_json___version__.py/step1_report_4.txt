{
  "purpose": "Defines and exposes the version of the package, with a comment indicating version management via git tags.",
  "sources": "The line '__version__ = \"0.0.0\"' where the version string is assigned.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sources or sinks present in this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code simply assigns a static value to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "The comment mentions 'Allows common version lookup via from dataclasses_json import __version__', which is unrelated to the actual code, but this is a benign comment. The version is hardcoded as '0.0.0', intended to be replaced during deployment, which is typical and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a version string assignment and a comment. There are no dynamic or untrusted data inputs, no code execution, and no security-sensitive operations. The comment suggests standard version management practices. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version placeholder with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard practice to set version strings in this manner. No potential security issues are present.",
