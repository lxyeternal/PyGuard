  "purpose": "Define the version string for the module, allowing version lookup and management.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable, which is a static string in this case.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs are used in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the version is hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a comment indicating the version is replaced by a git tag upon deployment, but this is a common practice and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module-level variable __version__ with a static string. The comment suggests that during deployment, this value is replaced with the actual git tag, a typical version management approach. No user input, network activity, or other data sources are involved. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. The code is straightforward and typical for Python modules.",
