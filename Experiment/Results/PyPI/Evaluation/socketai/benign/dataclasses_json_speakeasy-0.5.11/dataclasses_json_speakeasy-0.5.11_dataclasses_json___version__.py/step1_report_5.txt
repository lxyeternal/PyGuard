{
  "purpose": "Defines the version of the module, with a placeholder value to be replaced during deployment.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable from a static string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Comment referencing import from dataclasses_json, which is unrelated to the version assignment. The version string is hardcoded, but that is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string for the module, with a comment indicating it is replaced by a git tag during deployment. The comment mentions an import from dataclasses_json, but this import is not present in the code, suggesting a possibly misplaced or outdated comment. There are no dynamic or user-input-based components, nor any suspicious or malicious code behavior. The version string is static, and there are no external dependencies or data flows indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version placeholder with an unrelated comment. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard version declaration with no suspicious activity.",
