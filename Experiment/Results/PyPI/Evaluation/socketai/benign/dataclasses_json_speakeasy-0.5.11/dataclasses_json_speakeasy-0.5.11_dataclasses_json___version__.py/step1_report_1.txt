{
  "purpose": "Defines the version of the module, allowing version lookup via imported __version__",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ variable, reading the string '0.0.0'",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment only",
  "anomalies": "Comment suggests the version is replaced by a git tag during deployment, which is a standard practice and not suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, defining a __version__ variable with a placeholder value. The comment indicates that this value is replaced during deployment, a common versioning approach. No input reading, no external data handling, and no suspicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward version declaration with a standard comment; no malicious behavior, malware, or security issues detected.",
