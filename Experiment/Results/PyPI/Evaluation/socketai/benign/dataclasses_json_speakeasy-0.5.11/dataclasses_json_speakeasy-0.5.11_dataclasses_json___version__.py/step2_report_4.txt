  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a minimal version declaration, with a comment indicating it will be replaced by a git tag during deployment. No input, no external data, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here. The report's reasoning is sound.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to report 1, emphasizing standard practice. No dynamic code or external inputs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a straightforward version string with a comment about git tags. No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern; no malicious behavior. The comment about 'from dataclasses_json import __version__' is unrelated but benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly different comment mentioning 'import from dataclasses_json,' which is not present in the code snippet. The version string is static, and no dynamic behavior is observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), but still reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is a simple version placeholder, with comments indicating it will be replaced during deployment.\n- There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The malware score should remain 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0; the code is straightforward.\n- The risk score is appropriately 0, as this is standard version management code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is benign, and the reports are accurate in their assessments.",
