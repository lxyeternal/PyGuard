  "purpose": "Define the package version, intended to be replaced during deployment.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of __version__; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external outputs.",
  "flows": "None; the code simply assigns a value to __version__ without any data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Comment referencing 'from dataclasses_json import __version__' is unrelated and potentially confusing but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static version declaration with a comment indicating it will be replaced during deployment. No input, no dynamic behavior, no external data sources, and no suspicious code or obfuscation are present. The comment referencing an import from 'dataclasses_json' is unrelated to the code snippet and appears to be a documentation artifact. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version placeholder with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Comments referencing unrelated modules are benign. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero.",
