  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is a straightforward assignment of `__version__ = \"0.0.0\"` with a comment indicating replacement during deployment.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No errors or malicious behavior. The comment is standard practice.  \n- **Scores:** All scores (obfuscated, malware, securityRisk) are zero, which aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Justification:** The report's conclusion is accurate; no issues are present.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; a static version string with a comment about replacing it with a git tag.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No errors or malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis.  \n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity detected.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Similar static assignment with a comment.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent.  \n- **Note:** The mention of the unrelated import in the comment is benign and likely a documentation artifact.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern—static version string with a comment.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The comment mentions an import from `dataclasses_json`, which is not present in the code snippet, indicating a possibly misplaced or outdated comment.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n- **Justification:** The comment inconsistency is minor and does not imply malicious intent.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same static assignment with a comment.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The comment references an import from `dataclasses_json`, which is not present in the code, suggesting a copy-paste or documentation inconsistency.  \n- **Scores:** The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), but the malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores are zero, which is appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity is indicated; the comment inconsistency is benign.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, as expected. No malicious behavior is present.  \n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero; the code is straightforward.  \n- **Security risk scores:** All zero; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors detected.  \n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The comments referencing `from dataclasses_json import __version__` in some reports seem to be misplaced or outdated, but they do not impact security.  \n- The static assignment of `__version__` with a comment about deployment-time replacement is standard practice and not suspicious.  \n\n### My estimated scores after review:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Risk:** 0 across all reports.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a minimal, standard version placeholder with no malicious, obfuscated, or security issues. The comments are typical, with minor inconsistencies that do not affect security. The reports are accurate in their assessments.",
