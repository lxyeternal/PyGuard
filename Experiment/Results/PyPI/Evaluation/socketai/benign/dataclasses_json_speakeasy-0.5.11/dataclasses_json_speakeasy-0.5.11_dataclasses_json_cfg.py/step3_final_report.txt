  "purpose": "Configure serialization metadata, including validation, encoding, decoding, and case formatting.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'metadata', 'encoder', 'decoder', 'mm_field', 'letter_case', 'undefined', 'field_name', 'exclude'.",
  "sinks": "Stored in 'metadata' dictionary for later use; no direct data sinks or external flows within this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to 'lib_metadata' entries; no execution or data flow to external systems occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Potentially storing user-supplied callables ('letter_case', 'exclude') for later invocation, which could be misused if invoked improperly outside this context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration utility for a serialization library, validating 'undefined' parameters against an enum, and storing optional user-provided functions and settings. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external system interactions are present. The only minor concern is the storage of user functions for later use, which could be misused if invoked unsafely elsewhere, but within this snippet, no such invocation occurs. The validation of 'undefined' is standard and safe. Overall, the code is benign and safe for typical use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard configuration setup with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minimal potential misuse of stored callables is typical in configuration contexts and does not constitute a security threat here.",
