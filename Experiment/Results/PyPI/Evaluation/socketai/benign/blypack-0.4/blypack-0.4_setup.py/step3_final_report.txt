{
  "purpose": "Defines a Python package setup and executes 'whoami' during installation as a post-install action.",
  "sources": "The function post_install() calls os.system('whoami') immediately after definition.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'whoami' is printed to the console; no data is leaked externally.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining post_install() to executing os.system('whoami') during setup, then proceeds with package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of a system command ('whoami') during setup is unconventional and potentially a privacy concern; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a benign action that outputs the current user during setup, which is unusual but not malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0. The security risk scores vary from 0.1 to 0.5, reflecting the pattern of executing system commands during installation. Given the benign command but unconventional practice, a moderate security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a harmless command ('whoami') during setup, which is unconventional but not malicious. The malware score remains 0, and obfuscation is absent. The security risk score should be around 0.2, acknowledging the unusual pattern but low actual threat.",
