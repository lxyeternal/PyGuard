{
  "purpose": "Defines a Python package setup configuration and executes a post-installation command.",
  "sources": "The post_install() function calls os.system('whoami') which executes the system command 'whoami'.",
  "sinks": "The os.system('whoami') command executes a system command that can reveal the current user, which is a benign informational sink in this context.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the call to post_install() at the end of the script, which executes os.system('whoami') and outputs the current user.",
  "anomalies": "The direct call to os.system('whoami') at the script's end is unusual in setup scripts; typically, post-install actions are handled via custom commands or hooks, not immediate execution upon import.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a standard setup() call for a Python package with minimal configuration. The post_install() function, which runs os.system('whoami'), is invoked immediately after the setup() call. The use of os.system to execute 'whoami' simply outputs the current system username, which is harmless and does not perform malicious actions like data exfiltration or system modification. The approach of calling post_install() directly at the end is unconventional but not malicious. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads present. The code's main anomaly is the immediate execution of a system command outside of proper install hooks, which could be considered suspicious if malicious intent was present, but in this case, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with an unusual but harmless command execution that outputs the current user. There is no malicious behavior, no backdoors, or harmful data leaks identified. The code does not exhibit obfuscation or malware characteristics. Overall, the script poses no significant security risk.",
