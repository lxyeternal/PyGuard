{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration and executes a post-installation function that runs a system command.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines package metadata and calls os.system('whoami') in post_install().",
  "sinks": "The os.system('whoami') executes a system command that reveals the current user, which could be considered sensitive information leakage.",
  "flows": "The code calls post_install() after defining it, which then executes os.system('whoami'), potentially exposing the system username.",
  "anomalies": "Calling os.system('whoami') during setup is unusual; setup scripts typically do not execute system commands that could leak information or perform actions beyond setup.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package named 'blypack' with version 0.4. It defines a post_install() function that executes 'whoami' using os.system. This function is called immediately after defining it, causing the command to run during the script execution. The use of os.system('whoami') is a potential information leak and is an unusual practice in package setup scripts. There are no other malicious behaviors or suspicious code constructs. No external input is read, and no malicious sinks or flows beyond the info leak are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or malware, but the execution of 'whoami' during installation could be considered unnecessary and a minor information leak. This behavior is unusual for setup scripts and could be exploited to gather system info, though it is not malicious in intent. Overall, the risk is low, but the practice is questionable.",
