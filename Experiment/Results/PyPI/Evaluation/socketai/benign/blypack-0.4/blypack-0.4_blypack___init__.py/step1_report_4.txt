  "purpose": "Initializes the package namespace for 'mi_paquete'.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reads present.",
  "sinks": "No output, network communication, or data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists.",
  "anomalies": "Empty __init__.py file; no code or logic present, which is unusual but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The file is a standard empty __init__.py used to mark a directory as a package. It contains no code, data handling, or external interactions. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious patterns are observable. Since it is only an empty initialization file, it does not introduce any security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an empty package initializer with no behavior, malicious intent, or security concerns. It is typical in Python packages to have an empty __init__.py, and there are no indicators of malicious activity.",
