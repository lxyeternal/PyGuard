  "conclusion": "The code is a standard administrative PowerShell template for Active Directory user management. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is potential command injection if input variables are not sanitized before execution. The malware score is 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. The security risk score should be increased to approximately 0.6 if considering untrusted input scenarios, but currently remains around 0.2–0.4. Ensuring input validation is essential to prevent misuse."
