{
  "purpose": "Perform address lookup by combining street name and postal code, then querying an external DARClient service to retrieve a UUID.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'street_name' and 'postal_code'; instantiation of DARClient; call to 'cleanse_single' method.",
  "sinks": "The external 'DARClient' service acts as the sink where data is sent; the response's 'id' is retrieved and returned.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are combined into a string, passed to 'DARClient.cleanse_single', which returns a response from which 'id' is extracted.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling with 'print' statements; instantiation of 'DARClient' on each function call; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an address string, calls an external API client within a context manager, and retrieves an address UUID. Error handling is minimal and could be improved, but no malicious or suspicious code is present. The external dependency 'DARClient' is assumed legitimate. The function is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's simplicity and external reliance. The main concern is the error printing, which could leak information, but this does not elevate the security risk significantly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard address lookup utility interfacing with an external API. It shows no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score correctly indicates no malicious intent. Minor improvements could be made in error handling practices, but overall, the code is safe.",
