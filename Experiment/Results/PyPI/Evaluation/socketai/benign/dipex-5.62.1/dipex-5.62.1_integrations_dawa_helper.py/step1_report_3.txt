{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility function to lookup an address UUID using an external DAR client based on address components.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'street_name' and 'postal_code', and the instantiation of DARClient() within the function.",
  "sinks": "The call to darclient.cleanse_single() which sends combined address string to an external service, and printing exceptions to standard output.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are combined into a string and sent to the external 'darclient.cleanse_single()' method; exceptions are caught and logged; the UUID is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a broad 'except Exception' block only logs to standard output, which could hide errors or issues; no hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible. No obfuscated code or malicious indicators are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it creates an instance of an external DARClient, uses it to cleanse an address string, and retrieves an ID. The function is cached to improve performance. Exception handling is generic, but it only logs errors rather than obscuring or executing malicious actions. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection are evident. Usage of external client appears to be standard, assuming DARClient is a legitimate library. The code does not include any malicious data handling or access to sensitive data beyond the address string.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility function for address lookup with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It uses external libraries properly and handles errors without exposing secrets or executing harmful actions.",
