{
  "purpose": "The code performs address lookup by querying an external DARClient service to retrieve a UUID for a given address string composed of street details and postal code.",
  "sources": "The function reads `street_name` and `postal_code` input parameters. It also creates and uses an instance of `DARClient` to fetch data.",
  "sinks": "The code calls `DARClient.cleanse_single()` with a constructed address string. The response is used to extract an address UUID. Error messages are printed to standard output upon exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters `street_name` and `postal_code` are combined into a string. This string is passed to `darclient.cleanse_single()`. The response is accessed to retrieve the 'id' field, which is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code prints exception details directly to standard output instead of logging securely or handling errors gracefully. No other suspicious or unusual code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a cached function to avoid repeated external requests for the same address. It instantiates `DARClient` within a context manager, implying proper resource management. The external call to `cleanse_single()` could be a point of concern if it involved untrusted input, but here, it is only data passed from parameters. The exception handling simply prints errors, which is minimal but not malicious. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated logic present. The function is designed for address lookup, and all data flows seem benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward address lookup utility that interfaces with an external client. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code segment. The only minor concern is non-structured error handling, but this does not constitute malicious intent.",
