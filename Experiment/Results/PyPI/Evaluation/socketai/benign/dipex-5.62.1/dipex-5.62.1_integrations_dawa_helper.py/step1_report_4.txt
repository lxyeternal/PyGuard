{
  "purpose": "The code provides a cached function to look up address UUIDs using the DARClient from an external module, based on street name and postal code.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters 'street_name' and 'postal_code', and initializes 'DARClient' within the function.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'DARClient().cleanse_single()' with combined address string, and accesses the 'id' key from the reply.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> combined_address_string -> DARClient().cleanse_single() -> response['id'] -> return value",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual dynamic code; use of exception handling that prints errors could be considered suboptimal but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The function caches address lookups to avoid repeated external calls. It constructs an address string from provided parameters, then uses an external 'DARClient' to retrieve an address UUID. The use of try-except prevents crashes but only prints exceptions without further handling, which is common but not inherently suspicious. The external library 'fastramqpi.os2mo_dar_client' appears to be legitimate, and there is no evidence of data exfiltration, malicious code, or backdoors. The code does not perform any network operations outside of the 'DARClient' call and does not handle sensitive information beyond address strings.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward address lookup function utilizing an external client, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain attacks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The overall security risk is low.",
