  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard address lookup utility interfacing with an external API. It shows no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score correctly indicates no malicious intent. Minor improvements could be made in error handling practices, but overall, the code is safe."
