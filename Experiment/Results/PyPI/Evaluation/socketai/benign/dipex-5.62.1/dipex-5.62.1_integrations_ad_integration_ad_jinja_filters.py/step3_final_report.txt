  "purpose": "Generate unique email addresses from a person's name by normalizing input, creating multiple variants, and avoiding duplicates based on existing email list.",
  "sources": "Input name string, existing email list via _get_all_ad_emails()",
  "sinks": "Generated email address returned; no external data sinks or network activity",
  "flows": "Name input -> normalization and splitting -> variant generation -> duplicate check against existing emails -> return unique email",
  "anomalies": "None; standard string processing, regex, and list filtering; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code normalizes names, creates multiple email variants, and checks for existing emails to ensure uniqueness. It uses standard libraries and patterns without obfuscation or malicious behavior. No external network activity, credentials, or backdoors are present. The scoring of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk=0.1 is consistent with its benign purpose. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and does not contain vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for generating unique email addresses from names, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
