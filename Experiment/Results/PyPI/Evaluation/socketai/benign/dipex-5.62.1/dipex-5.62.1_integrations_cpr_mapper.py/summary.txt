  "conclusion": "The code is safe, straightforward, and performs a simple CSV-to-dictionary mapping. The only notable issue is a potential logical bug if data is malformed, but this does not constitute a security threat. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero; security risk is minimal (~0.1) due to possible runtime errors, not malicious intent."
