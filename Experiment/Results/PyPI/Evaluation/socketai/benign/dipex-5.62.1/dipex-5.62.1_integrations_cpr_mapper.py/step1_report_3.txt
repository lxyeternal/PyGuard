{
  "purpose": "Parse a CSV file to map employee CPR numbers to their corresponding UUIDs.",
  "sources": "The filename argument in the employee_mapper function; the CSV file being opened and read.",
  "sinks": "The dictionary returned by the function; the data stored in memory.",
  "flows": "The filename input leads to file reading; the CSV data flows into a dictionary via the map and itemgetter functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The code reads from a filename parameter, but this is standard for file processing.",
  "analysis": "The function opens a user-provided filename and reads CSV data with a specified delimiter. It extracts specific fields ('cpr' and 'mo_uuid') from each row using csv.DictReader and constructs a dictionary. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The use of itemgetter and DictReader is safe and standard. The test docstring demonstrates correct usage and validates functionality without revealing any security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CSV parsing function with no malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. It safely reads and processes input data without evident security risks.",
