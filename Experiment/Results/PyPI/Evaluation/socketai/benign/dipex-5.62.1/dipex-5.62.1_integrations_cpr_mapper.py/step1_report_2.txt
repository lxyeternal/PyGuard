  "purpose": "Parse a CSV file containing employee identifiers and map 'cpr' to 'mo_uuid'.",
  "sources": "Reading data from a file specified by filename, using csv.DictReader to parse the CSV content.",
  "sinks": "Returning a dictionary constructed from the CSV data; no direct sink of untrusted data that leads to security effects.",
  "flows": "Read filename -> parse CSV -> create dictionary from 'cpr' and 'mo_uuid' columns -> return dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'map(itemgetter('cpr', 'mo_uuid'), reader)' which is unconventional; generally, map with itemgetter on a DictReader yields tuples, but here it's used with dict() to create a dict. No suspicious code behavior. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no malicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a CSV file with semicolon delimiters, extracts specific columns ('cpr' and 'mo_uuid'), and creates a dictionary mapping 'cpr' values to 'mo_uuid' values. The use of csv.DictReader is standard, and 'map(itemgetter())' is used to extract key-value pairs for dictionary creation, which is an accepted pattern. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscated sections, or anomalous behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CSV parser that maps employee IDs to UUIDs. It performs normal operations without malicious intent or security risks.",
