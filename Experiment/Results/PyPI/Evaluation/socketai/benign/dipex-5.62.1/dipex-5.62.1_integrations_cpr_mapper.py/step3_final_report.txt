  "purpose": "Reads a CSV file with employee data, mapping 'cpr' to 'mo_uuid'.",
  "sources": "File input specified by filename parameter.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Reads CSV -> parses rows -> extracts 'cpr' and 'mo_uuid' -> constructs dictionary mapping 'cpr' to 'mo_uuid'.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'itemgetter' to extract multiple fields, then passes resulting tuples directly to 'dict()', which is correct if data is well-formed; potential logical bug if data is malformed, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a CSV file with a semicolon delimiter, uses 'csv.DictReader' to parse rows, and employs 'map(itemgetter(\"cpr\", \"mo_uuid\"), reader)' to extract pairs. Since 'itemgetter' returns a tuple '(cpr, mo_uuid)', passing these tuples directly to 'dict()' creates a dictionary with 'cpr' as key and 'mo_uuid' as value, which is valid. The main concern is data integrity; no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is straightforward, with no network activity or secret handling. The logical bug identified in reports relates to data correctness, not security. Therefore, the code is safe but may encounter runtime errors if data is malformed, which is not a security issue.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, straightforward, and performs a simple CSV-to-dictionary mapping. The only notable issue is a potential logical bug if data is malformed, but this does not constitute a security threat. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero; security risk is minimal (~0.1) due to possible runtime errors, not malicious intent.",
