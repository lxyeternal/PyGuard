{
  "purpose": "Read a CSV file to map employee CPR numbers to their corresponding UUIDs.",
  "sources": "File input via open(filename), csv.DictReader reading from the file stream.",
  "sinks": "Data returned as a dictionary mapping CPR to UUID, no external outputs or network communication.",
  "flows": "File input (source) is read into a CSV DictReader, which supplies data to the map function, resulting in a dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code opens a CSV file specified by filename, uses csv.DictReader with a semicolon delimiter, and maps 'cpr' to 'mo_uuid' for each row into a dictionary. The function includes a docstring with a test case demonstrating correct behavior. No input/output data is sent over network, no environment variables are accessed insecurely, and no suspicious or malicious patterns are observed. The code’s simplicity and standard library usage suggest no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, legitimate CSV parsing and mapping task without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It appears safe and intended for data processing purposes only.",
