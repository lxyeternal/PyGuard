{
  "purpose": "The function reads a CSV file containing employee data and maps CPR numbers to their corresponding UUIDs.",
  "sources": "File input specified by filename, read via open() and csv.DictReader.",
  "targets": "Returns a dictionary mapping CPR to UUID, not writing or modifying external data.",
  "flows": "Reads from the file, processes data with csv.DictReader, and constructs a dictionary mapping CPR to UUID.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code opens a CSV file, uses csv.DictReader with a specified delimiter, and employs itemgetter to extract specific fields ('cpr' and 'mo_uuid') from each row to build a dictionary. The function includes a docstring with an example demonstrating its expected behavior. There are no indications of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of csv.DictReader and itemgetter is standard and safe. The code operates solely on local file input and returns a simple mapping, with no external or hidden effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, safe, and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply reads a CSV file and returns a mapping of identifiers. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
