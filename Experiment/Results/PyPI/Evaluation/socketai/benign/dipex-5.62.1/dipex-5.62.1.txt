      "conclusion": "The code is safe, straightforward, and performs a simple CSV-to-dictionary mapping. The only notable issue is a potential logical bug if data is malformed, but this does not constitute a security threat. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero; security risk is minimal (~0.1) due to possible runtime errors, not malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard address lookup utility interfacing with an external API. It shows no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score correctly indicates no malicious intent. Minor improvements could be made in error handling practices, but overall, the code is safe."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard administrative PowerShell template for Active Directory user management. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is potential command injection if input variables are not sanitized before execution. The malware score is 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. The security risk score should be increased to approximately 0.6 if considering untrusted input scenarios, but currently remains around 0.2–0.4. Ensuring input validation is essential to prevent misuse."

The overall security risk is moderate, around 0.55, reflecting the suspicion level. Other code snippets are benign, with scores appropriately low. Further review of actual code execution context is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
