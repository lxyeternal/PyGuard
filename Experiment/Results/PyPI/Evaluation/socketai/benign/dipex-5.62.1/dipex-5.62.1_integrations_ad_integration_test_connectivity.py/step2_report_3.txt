  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a testing utility for Active Directory connectivity, data retrieval, and write configuration validation.\n- It uses standard libraries (`requests`, `click`, custom modules) and performs network and directory interactions.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- Error handling is straightforward, primarily printing or logging errors.\n- The functions perform network requests, AD data reads, and configuration checks.\n- The code outputs potentially sensitive info (e.g., user properties, error messages), but this aligns with diagnostic intent.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose:** Testing AD connectivity, contact, and data.\n\n**Analysis:** No malicious activity or suspicious patterns. The code is standard for administrative testing.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Risk: 0 (correct, as no security risk identified)\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose:** Testing connectivity, read/write access, and validation.\n\n**Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, no signs of malicious activity. It performs standard network and directory checks.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Risk: 0.2 — Slightly elevated but justifiable due to the potential exposure of internal info in error messages.\n\n**Justification for risk score:** The code can leak internal system details via print/logs if errors occur, which could be a security concern if logs are exposed, but no active malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** **Reasonable scores.**\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose:** Connectivity and read/write validation, similar to above.\n\n**Analysis:** Same as previous, standard diagnostic code with no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2 — Same reasoning as above, mainly due to error message exposure.\n\n**Verdict:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose:** Connectivity and read/write tests, with focus on settings and responses.\n\n**Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity. The code reveals internal details in error messages, which could be a security concern but not malicious.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2 — Consistent with previous assessments.\n\n**Verdict:** **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose:** Connectivity and configuration testing.\n\n**Analysis:** Same as others, straightforward diagnostic code.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2 — Due to potential info leakage in logs/errors.\n\n**Verdict:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated at 0.2 in all reports, justified by the fact that error messages could leak sensitive internal info, which is a minor security concern but not an active threat.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious behavior observed.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, well-structured code.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.2** — Due to potential info leakage via error messages, which could be exploited if logs are publicly accessible.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports' scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's behavior. The code is a standard administrative utility with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent, but caution should be taken to secure logs and error outputs to prevent info leaks.",
