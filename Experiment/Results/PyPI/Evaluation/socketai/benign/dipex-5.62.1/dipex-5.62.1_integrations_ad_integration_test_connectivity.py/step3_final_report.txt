  "purpose": "Diagnostic utility for Active Directory connectivity testing, data retrieval, and configuration validation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, AD data, network responses, user input, configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Print statements, logs, network requests, exception messages.",
  "flows": "Sources (AD data, environment variables) lead to sinks (print/logs, network requests) primarily through function calls and exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; minor typos and logical inconsistencies in function calls.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard AD connectivity and data validation tasks. It uses typical exception handling, network requests, and data processing without obfuscation or malicious patterns. Minor issues include a typo in an error message ('Credentails') and a probable copy-paste error where 'perform_read_test()' is called twice instead of 'perform_write_test()' for the write flag. The error messages could leak internal info, but this is common in diagnostic scripts. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified given the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious AD diagnostic utility. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary; the low risk score reflects minor info leakage potential, which is acceptable for such scripts.",
