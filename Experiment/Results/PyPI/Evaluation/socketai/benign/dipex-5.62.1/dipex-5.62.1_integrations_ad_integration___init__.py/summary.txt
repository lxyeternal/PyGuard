  "conclusion": "The code shows potential security concerns primarily due to dynamic eval/exec on untrusted input, warranting a malware score of approximately 0.4. The overall security risk is moderate, around 0.55, reflecting the suspicion level. Other code snippets are benign, with scores appropriately low. Further review of actual code execution context is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
