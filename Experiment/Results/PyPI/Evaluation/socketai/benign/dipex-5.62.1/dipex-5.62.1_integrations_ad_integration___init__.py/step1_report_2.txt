{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to data processing or functionality provided by an external library, but specific details are not provided due to the absence of code content.",
  "sources": "The code may read input from function arguments, user input, environment variables, or external files, but no specific source code is visible.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication, file writing, executing system commands, or leaking data via logs or prints, but no explicit sinks are identified due to lack of code content.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow paths can be identified without code; typically, source-to-sink flows would involve untrusted input passing through processing functions to output or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are detectable given the absence of code content.",
  "analysis": "The review is limited due to missing code content; no sources, sinks, or flows can be confirmed. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident from the provided prompt, but this limits confidence in security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient code provided for a detailed security analysis. Based on available information, no malicious behavior or security risks can be confirmed. The code appears standard but cannot be fully evaluated.",
  "confidence": 0.3,
  "obfuscated": 0,
