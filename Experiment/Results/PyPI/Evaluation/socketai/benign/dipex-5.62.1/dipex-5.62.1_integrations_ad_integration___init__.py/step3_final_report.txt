  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, and suspicious patterns, focusing on dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, imported modules, file/network I/O, dynamic eval/exec statements.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input or environment variables flow into eval/exec or network transmission points, potentially leading to data exfiltration or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec on untrusted data, hardcoded URLs or credentials, unnecessary dynamic execution, lack of code or only import statements, no suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical patterns of dynamic execution and data handling. In the absence of concrete malicious payloads, suspicion is moderate. The use of eval/exec on untrusted input is a significant concern but not confirmed malicious without further context. Other code snippets are benign, such as setup scripts or import lists. The flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks could be exploited if misused, but current evidence is insufficient for definitive malicious classification.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows potential security concerns primarily due to dynamic eval/exec on untrusted input, warranting a malware score of approximately 0.4. The overall security risk is moderate, around 0.55, reflecting the suspicion level. Other code snippets are benign, with scores appropriately low. Further review of actual code execution context is recommended to confirm malicious intent.",
