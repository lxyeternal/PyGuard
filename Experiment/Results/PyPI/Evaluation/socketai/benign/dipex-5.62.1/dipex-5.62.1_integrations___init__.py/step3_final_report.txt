  "purpose": "The code is intended for data processing or utility functions, with no malicious or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, data flow from untrusted sources to processing routines.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variables, or data outputs that could leak information or be exploited.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like network or file system, with no evidence of malicious manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures identified.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign with straightforward logic. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. Security risk scores are low, reflecting minimal inherent risk. Confidence in benign nature is high (0.8-0.9). No anomalies or vulnerabilities detected. The code's purpose aligns with utility functions, and no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe and free of malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating no immediate security concerns. Minor risk scores account for potential untrusted data handling but do not suggest malicious activity.",
