{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the public API module for tensorflow_datasets, managing imports and API exposure without executing any logic or handling data.",
  "sources": "Import statements from various tensorflow_datasets modules and the lazy_imports setup for optional testing modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process user input, network data, or external files.",
  "flows": "The code only defines imports and exports; there are no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with standard import patterns and no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static API setup module with no dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity. The use of lazy_imports is a common pattern for optional dependencies. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All import statements are standard, and the overall structure is typical for a Python package's initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions solely as an API surface definition for tensorflow_datasets, and static analysis confirms its safety.",
