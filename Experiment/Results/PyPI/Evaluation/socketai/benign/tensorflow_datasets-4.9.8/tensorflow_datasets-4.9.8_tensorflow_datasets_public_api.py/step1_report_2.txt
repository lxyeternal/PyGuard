{
  "purpose": "This code defines the public API and imports necessary modules for the tensorflow_datasets package, providing access to various functionalities related to dataset handling, visualization, and utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from __future__, etils, tensorflow_datasets, and its submodules. No direct user input or external data sources are explicitly read within this file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as system calls, network connections, or file writes are present. The code only performs module imports and assigns __all__.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code primarily manages imports and API exposure.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The use of lazy_imports and __future__ imports is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a module that imports various submodules and functions from tensorflow_datasets and related utilities, setting up the public API via __all__. It employs lazy importing for testing modules, which is a common technique to reduce initial load time. The file contains only import statements, a license header, and API definitions. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling occurs here. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup for tensorflow_datasets, exposing APIs without performing any data processing, network activity, or other potentially malicious actions. It presents no security risks or malware indicators based on its static content.",
