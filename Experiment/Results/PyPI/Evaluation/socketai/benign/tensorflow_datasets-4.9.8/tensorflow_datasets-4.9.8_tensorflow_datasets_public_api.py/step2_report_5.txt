  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's static content, import patterns, and overall structure.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily composed of import statements, API exposure via `__all__`, licensing comments, and a lazy import pattern for testing modules.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data handling, network activity, or any form of untrusted data processing.\n- The use of `epy.lazy_imports()` is a standard technique to optimize startup time, not malicious obfuscation.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present.\n- The code is typical for a Python package's `__init__.py` or API module, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Specific points per report:**\n- **Reports 1-5:** All conclude with a security risk score of 0, malware score of 0, and obfuscated code score of 0, which aligns with the static analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- No issues are evident in the code. It is a straightforward API setup.\n- The lazy import pattern is common and not suspicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or supply chain attack vectors.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, given the lack of any security concern or malicious activity.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThe code is a benign, standard API module for tensorflow_datasets. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present. The supply chain appears secure based on this static code review.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as safe.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores; the code poses no security risk.",
