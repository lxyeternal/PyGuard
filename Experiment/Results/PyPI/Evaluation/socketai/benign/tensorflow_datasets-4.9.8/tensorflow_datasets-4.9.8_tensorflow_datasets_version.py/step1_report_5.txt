  "purpose": "Define and provide the stable version information for the TensorFlow Datasets library.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version number components (_MAJOR_VERSION, _MINOR_VERSION, _PATCH_VERSION).",
  "sinks": "The __version__ variable which concatenates version parts into a string.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version components -> joining into a string -> setting __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; version info is straightforward and hardcoded. No obfuscated code, no external inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version components as string literals and concatenates them to form a version string. No external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated patterns. The purpose is purely to define version info for the package. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely provides version information for the package with no malicious intent, no external data handling, and no security risks.",
