  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines version components (`_MAJOR_VERSION`, `_MINOR_VERSION`, `_PATCH_VERSION`) as string literals.\n- Concatenates these components with periods to form `__version__`.\n- Contains standard licensing and comments.\n- No dynamic input, external data, code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code\n- The code appears straightforward, static, and standard for version definition.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- No external dependencies or dynamic behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues or malicious code are present.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The analysis correctly notes the static nature and lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n**No errors in the reports' reasoning.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Review scores assigned to each issue\n- All reports assign:\n  - `obfuscated`: 0 or 0.0\n  - `malware`: 0 or 0.0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0 or 0.0\n- These scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n- The confidence scores are high (1.0), which is appropriate.\n\n**No adjustments needed for scores.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is appropriate.\n- Given the code's static, transparent, and benign nature, a higher score would be unjustified.\n- No signs of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or security risks.\n\n**Therefore, the risk scores are justified as is.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate malware score\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, dynamic code execution, or external data handling.\n- The purpose is purely to define version info.\n\n**The malware score is correctly assigned as 0.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities\n- All reports correctly identify the code as non-vulnerable.\n- No assumptions are made that could lead to false positives.\n- The code is static and does not process untrusted input or perform network operations.\n\n**No problematic assumptions detected.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Consistency of scores with the report\n- All scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- No discrepancies or overestimations are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard version string definition with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code is a straightforward, static version info file with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and analysis are appropriate.",
