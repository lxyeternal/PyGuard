  "purpose": "Defines and outputs the stable version information for the TensorFlow Datasets package.",
  "sources": "Constants defining version parts (_MAJOR_VERSION, _MINOR_VERSION, _PATCH_VERSION).",
  "sinks": "Concatenation and assignment to __version__.",
  "flows": "Version parts are read from constants and combined into a string assigned to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns version number components to string variables, then joins them with periods to create a version string. It is standard version management code with no external input, no malicious functions, and no suspicious behavior. No data leaks, code injections, or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply constructs and exposes a version string for the package. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
