  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code defines three string constants: `_MAJOR_VERSION`, `_MINOR_VERSION`, `_PATCH_VERSION`.\n- It concatenates these with periods to produce `__version__`.\n- All variables are static strings, hardcoded, with no external input, dynamic code, or obfuscation.\n- The code is standard for defining version info in a package.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code is straightforward and standard.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no code execution, external data, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors or flaws; the code functions as intended for version management.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risks:** None.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the reports:\n\nAll five reports:\n- Correctly identify the purpose as defining and exposing version info.\n- Accurately describe the data flow as static assignment and concatenation.\n- Correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- Assign a confidence score of 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n\n**Scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is correct.\n- `obfuscated: 0` is correct.\n- `securityRisk: 0` is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent, accurate, and thorough.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not contain any hidden or malicious payloads, and the scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Additional note:** Since the code is purely static, with no external dependencies or dynamic behaviors, these scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is benign, standard version management code.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the existing reports and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final verdict:** The reports are accurate; the code poses no security risk, is not malicious, and is not obfuscated. The scoring is appropriate.",
