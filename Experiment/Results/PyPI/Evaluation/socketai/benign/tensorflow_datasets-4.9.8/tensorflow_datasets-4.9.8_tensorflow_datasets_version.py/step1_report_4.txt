  "sources": "Hardcoded version components (_MAJOR_VERSION, _MINOR_VERSION, _PATCH_VERSION).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static assignment of version numbers without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and contains only static version info.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version components as static strings and combines them into a version string. It includes license and copyright notices, but no dynamic or external data processing occurs. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, static version info file with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It adheres to standard practices for version management.",
