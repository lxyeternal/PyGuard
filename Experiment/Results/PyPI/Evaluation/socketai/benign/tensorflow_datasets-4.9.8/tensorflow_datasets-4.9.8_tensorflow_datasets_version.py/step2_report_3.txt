  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is straightforward: defining static version components as strings, then concatenating them into a version string assigned to `__version__`.\n   - No dynamic code execution, external input, or obfuscation.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, secrets, or vulnerabilities.\n   - The code is standard for version management.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious or security issues.\n   - They are consistent, thorough, and accurate in their assessments.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely static, with no external inputs or dynamic behavior, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - No reason to elevate the risk score based on the current code.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - The assessments are aligned with the code's simplicity and transparency.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a minimal, standard version info definition with no malicious or suspicious characteristics. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep all scores at 0.  \n- No further action needed.\n\n**Note:** If future versions include dynamic code or external inputs, re-evaluation would be necessary.",
