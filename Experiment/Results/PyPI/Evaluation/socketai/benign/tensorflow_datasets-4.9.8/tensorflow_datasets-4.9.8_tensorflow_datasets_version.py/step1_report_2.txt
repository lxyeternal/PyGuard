  "analysis": "The code simply defines version components as strings, then joins them into a __version__ string. No input handling, no external data sources, no code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. The code follows standard semantic versioning practices. No obfuscation or malicious patterns present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version info definition with no malicious or security concerns.",
