  "purpose": "Define and expose the stable version information for a software package, specifically related to TensorFlow Datasets.",
  "sources": "Constants defining version components (_MAJOR_VERSION, _MINOR_VERSION, _PATCH_VERSION), concatenation to create __version__.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to __version__, which is a public identifier; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Version component constants are combined to form __version__, which is then exposed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard versioning pattern with no hardcoded secrets, code execution, or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports no external data sources, performs straightforward string concatenation to form the version string, and exposes it via a variable. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling. The license and copyright comments do not influence execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version info file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It serves its intended purpose of defining software version numbers securely and transparently.",
