  "purpose": "Defines static version information for the package using hardcoded version components.",
  "sources": "Static string constants for major, minor, and patch versions.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input is processed.",
  "flows": "Concatenation of static strings into a version string; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and follows standard versioning practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version components as static strings and joins them to form a version string. It contains no dynamic behavior, external inputs, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. All signals indicate benign, standard version management code. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No anomalies or malicious activity are present. The code is transparent and adheres to best practices, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version info snippet with no security risks or malicious behavior. The existing reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
