  "purpose": "Provides setup and teardown fixtures for unit testing, specifically to disable GitHub API calls during tests.",
  "sources": "Reads imports from 'unittest.mock', 'tensorflow_datasets.core.load', and 'tensorflow_datasets.core.github_api.github_path'. Uses mock.patch.object to modify behavior of github_path.GithubApi.query.",
  "sinks": "Mock patching could potentially suppress real API calls, but here it is used for testing purposes only, not maliciously.",
  "flows": "The function assert_no_api_call() patches github_path.GithubApi.query to raise an AssertionError, preventing real API calls during tests.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies. The code uses standard testing practices to disable API calls, with no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and a GitHub API path, then defines a fixture function to prevent real API calls by patching github_path.GithubApi.query. This is used as a safety measure in testing environments. The patch is applied globally to all tests via the GLOBAL_FIXTURES list. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code's purpose is purely for testing safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing fixture designed to disable external API calls during testing. There is no malicious behavior or security risk present.",
