{
  "purpose": "Provides setup and teardown fixtures for unittest and pytest frameworks, specifically for disabling GitHub API calls during testing.",
  "sources": "Import of 'mock' and functions from 'tensorflow_datasets.core' and 'tensorflow_datasets.core.github_api'; use of 'mock.patch.object' to override 'github_path.GithubApi.query'.",
  "sinks": "The 'mock.patch.object' replaces 'github_path.GithubApi.query' to prevent API calls; this is a controlled testing fixture, not an untrusted data sink.",
  "flows": "The fixture 'assert_no_api_call' uses 'mock.patch.object' to intercept and raise an error if the GitHub API query method is called during tests.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code employs standard testing practices for disabling API calls with mock, no obfuscated code or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a fixture to prevent actual GitHub API calls during tests by patching the 'query' method to raise an AssertionError. It imports testing-related modules and uses 'mock.patch.object' in a context manager to enforce this. The fixture is added to a list for global application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, serving a testing utility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing fixture designed to prevent real API calls in tests. It employs common mocking techniques and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. The security risk is negligible.",
