{
  "purpose": "The code provides setup and teardown fixtures for unit testing, specifically to disable GitHub API calls during tests in the TensorFlow Datasets project.",
  "sources": "The code reads static imports from unittest, tensorflow_datasets.core.load, and tensorflow_datasets.core.github_api.github_path.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or user input. The code only mocks methods to prevent API calls.",
  "flows": "The flow involves mocking the 'query' method of GithubApi to prevent actual API calls during testing, ensuring the side_effect raises AssertionError if called.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code uses standard testing practices, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a fixture 'assert_no_api_call' that patches the 'query' method of 'GithubApi' to raise an AssertionError, effectively disabling API calls during tests. The fixture is used globally to prevent unintended network access. The code relies on standard mocking libraries and testing modules. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present. The purpose is to ensure test safety by avoiding external API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard testing fixture setup designed to prevent external GitHub API calls during tests. There is no malicious behavior or security risk; it follows best practices for test isolation and mocking.",
