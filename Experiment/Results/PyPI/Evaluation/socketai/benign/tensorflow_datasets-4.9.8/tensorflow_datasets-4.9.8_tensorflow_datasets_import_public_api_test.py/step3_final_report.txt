  "purpose": "A minimal test script for tensorflow_datasets to verify import functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements for tensorflow_datasets.public_api and tfds.testing, execution of tfds.testing.test_main().",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Import statements lead to test_main() execution, which runs the test suite without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard testing scaffold with no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. It imports necessary modules, defines a placeholder test class, and runs the test main function. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious activity are present, and the code aligns with typical testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a simple test scaffold with no security risks or malicious intent. The existing scores and assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
