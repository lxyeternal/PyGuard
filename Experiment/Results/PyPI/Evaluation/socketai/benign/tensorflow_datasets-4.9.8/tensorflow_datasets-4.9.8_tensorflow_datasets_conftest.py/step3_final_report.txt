  "purpose": "Setup for pytest plugins, fixtures, and test environment configuration for TensorFlow Datasets testing.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, platform checks, and configuration data; reads system platform info and test files.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network activity, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Fixture registration and platform-specific patching without external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; standard test setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes pytest fixtures, handles platform-specific test skipping, mocks filesystem interactions, and registers setup/teardown fixtures. It employs standard practices without external data leaks, malicious commands, or obfuscation. The code is purely for testing infrastructure, with no external system interaction or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard testing setup for TensorFlow Datasets, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is effectively 0. The slight risk score of 0.1 in some reports is a conservative default and not indicative of actual risk.",
