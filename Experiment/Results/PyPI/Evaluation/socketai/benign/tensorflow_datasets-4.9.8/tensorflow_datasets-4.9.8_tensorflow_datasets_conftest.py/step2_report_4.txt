  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code against the described issues, and assess the scoring and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a pytest plugin setup for TensorFlow Datasets testing, with fixtures, platform-specific skips, and mocking. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Findings:** The code matches the description. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, consistent, and justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on test setup, mocking, and environment configuration. No malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** The code performs standard test environment setup, with platform checks and mocking filesystem, no external data leaks or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. The small risk score might be slightly conservative but acceptable given the platform-specific patching.\n- **Conclusion:** Well justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns, scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code handles pytest fixtures, platform-specific test skipping, and mocking. No malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** The code is standard for test setup, with no external communication or data leakage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The risk score of 0 aligns with the absence of suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with focus on test infrastructure, mocking, and environment configuration.\n- **Findings:** No malicious or obfuscated code, no external data leaks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard test setup with no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external threats.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code content:** The code is a typical pytest setup for testing TensorFlow Datasets, with fixtures, platform checks, and mocking. No external system calls, no data exfiltration, no obfuscation, and no malicious code detected.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (e.g., 0.1), likely due to platform-specific patching, which is standard practice and not risky.\n\n### Final expert judgment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minor, acceptable, related to platform-specific patching, not a security risk.\n\nThe reports are consistent and justified. No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1            |\n\nThis code is a standard, safe testing infrastructure with no security concerns.",
