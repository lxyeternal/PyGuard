{
  "purpose": "This script sets up and configures the tensorflow_datasets Python package, including dependency management, dataset file listings, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (TFDS_NIGHTLY_TIMESTAMP), package version import (version.py), and static dataset file paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external system interactions within this code.",
  "flows": "Environment variable reading influences version string composition; static dataset files are listed for packaging; dependencies are specified and configured.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or anomalies detected. The sys.path modification to include 'version.py' is standard for version management; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python package with dependency and file management. The use of environment variables is controlled and intended for versioning. No obfuscated code, network calls, or malicious patterns are present. The dependencies and static files are typical for a dataset library. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is well-structured, with no anomalies or suspicious operations.",
