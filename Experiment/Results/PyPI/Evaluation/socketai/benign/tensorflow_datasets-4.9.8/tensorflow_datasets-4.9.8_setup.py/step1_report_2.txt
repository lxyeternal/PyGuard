{
  "purpose": "The code sets up and configures the tensorflow/datasets library, defining dependencies, dataset files, and package metadata for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Imports (os, sys, pkg_resources, setuptools), environment variable 'TFDS_NIGHTLY_TIMESTAMP', __version__ from version.py, and dataset file paths.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or malicious actions could occur if untrusted data or environment variables are used insecurely, but the code does not process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'TFDS_NIGHTLY_TIMESTAMP' influences version string; dataset files are specified and packaged; dependencies are declared and used during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code follows standard setup.py patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py for a Python package, configuring dependencies, metadata, package data, and installation instructions. It adds a directory to sys.path to import a version. It dynamically adjusts versioning based on an environment variable. No untrusted input is processed; all data and dependencies are standard and well-documented. No obfuscation, malicious behaviors, or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate setup script for the tensorflow/datasets library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. All actions are standard for package distribution setup, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
