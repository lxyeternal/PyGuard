{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up the 'tensorflow-datasets' Python package, including dependency management, dataset file listings, and package configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'TFDS_NIGHTLY_TIMESTAMP', file system path manipulations, and the imported 'version' module.",
  "sinks": "The version string formatting, package installation dependencies, and package data specifications.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'TFDS_NIGHTLY_TIMESTAMP' influences version string; file paths are manipulated for package setup; dependencies and package data are specified for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious network activity; all code aligns with standard package setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily configures a Python package with dependencies, metadata, and data files. It reads environment variables to modify versioning, manipulates sys.path to import version info, and defines package data and dependencies accordingly. No code segments perform network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The code follows typical setup procedures and does not include obfuscated or malicious code. The presence of environment variable influence on versioning is standard in nightly builds, not suspicious. No anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses normal dependency management and package configuration techniques consistent with open-source Python packaging practices.",
