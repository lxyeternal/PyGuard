{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for the tensorflow_datasets Python package, responsible for configuring package metadata, dependencies, and data files for distribution.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'TFDS_NIGHTLY_TIMESTAMP' for versioning, local 'version.py' imported via sys.path, standard package data files, dependencies declarations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data sinks; no network or data exfiltration points present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable influences version string; local 'version.py' imported for version info; no data flows leading to potential vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.path modification to import 'version.py' is typical but could be a minor concern if 'version.py' were malicious; otherwise, no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: importing modules, handling versioning via environment variables, importing version info, defining dependencies and package data, and calling setuptools.setup(). No suspicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The dynamic import of 'version.py' via sys.path is common in package version management. All operations are typical for a setup script, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard setup script for an open-source Python package with no malicious activity or security risks. The use of environment variables and local imports is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
