  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report concludes that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It notes that no untrusted data flows or malicious code are present.\n- **Assessment:** The code performs typical setup operations, imports version info, reads environment variables for versioning, and manages dependencies and package data.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Clearly scored 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Confidence:** High (1), as the reviewer found no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it finds no suspicious behavior, no malicious code, and that the script is a typical setup.py.\n- **Assessment:** The environment variable influences versioning but does not introduce security risks. The sys.path modification to import version.py is standard.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Zero, consistent with the report.\n- **Confidence:** High (1.0).\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the script is a standard setup configuration with no malicious intent. The dynamic import via sys.path is noted but considered typical.\n- **Assessment:** No untrusted input processing, no network activity, no obfuscated code.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly lower (0.9), but still very high.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard setup script, no suspicious behavior, no malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** Environment variables and sys.path modifications are standard for version management.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Confidence:** Full (1).\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous reports—standard package setup, no malicious activity, no obfuscated code.\n- **Assessment:** No network calls, no dynamic code execution, no secrets.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Confidence:** Full (1).\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No issues are present in the code. All reports agree that the script is a typical setup.py for a Python package.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected across all reports.\n- **Risk Scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured setup script for a Python package, with no signs of compromise or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the detailed reviews, I concur with the assessments. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
