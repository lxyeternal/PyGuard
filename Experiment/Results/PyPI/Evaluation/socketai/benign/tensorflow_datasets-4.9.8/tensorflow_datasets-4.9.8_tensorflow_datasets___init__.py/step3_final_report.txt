{
  "purpose": "The code sets up lazy imports for various TensorFlow datasets modules with error handling to prevent import failures from crashing the program.",
  "sources": "Import statements, _epy.lazy_imports error callback",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or malicious data flows",
  "flows": "Lazy import calls with error callback, no data processing or network communication",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling, dynamic import pattern, no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard lazy import management with error handling for optional dependencies. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The broad exception handling is typical for import management but could hide errors; however, it does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious patterns or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup for managing optional dataset modules with no malicious or security issues. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
