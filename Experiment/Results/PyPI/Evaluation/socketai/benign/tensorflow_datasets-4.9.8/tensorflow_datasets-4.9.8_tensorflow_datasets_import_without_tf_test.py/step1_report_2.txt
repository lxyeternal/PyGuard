{
  "purpose": "The code defines a unit test to verify the import and functionality of the tensorflow_datasets library without loading TensorFlow itself.",
  "sources": "Reading import statements, sys.modules checks, and the mock patch decorators; the test function also creates and interacts with a dataset builder.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows to cause security issues; no network, file, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Importing tensorflow_datasets -> creating a dummy dataset -> calling download_and_prepare -> accessing data source -> asserting data values and module states.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code uses standard testing and mocking techniques, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward unit test designed to validate the behavior of the tensorflow_datasets library, specifically checking that it can be imported and used without requiring TensorFlow. It uses mocking to intercept certain calls and ensures that no TensorFlow modules are loaded prematurely. It creates a dummy dataset class, tests data generation, and confirms the proper behavior and module import states. The code does not contain any malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. All operations are within the normal scope of a testing environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test script for verifying dataset loading behavior with tensorflow_datasets, with no malicious or security concerns identified. It strictly adheres to safe testing practices.",
