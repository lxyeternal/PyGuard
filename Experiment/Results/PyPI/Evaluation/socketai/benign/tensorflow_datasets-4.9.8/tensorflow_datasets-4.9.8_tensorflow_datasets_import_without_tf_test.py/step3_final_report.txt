{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a unit test to verify the import behavior, dataset creation, and data loading functionalities of the tensorflow_datasets library without requiring TensorFlow itself.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from module imports, mock patches, and internal dataset generator methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not send data externally or handle untrusted external data.",
  "flows": "The source is the dataset generator and module imports; the flow proceeds through dataset preparation and assertions, with no external or network data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, benign unit test that imports modules, defines a dummy dataset, performs dataset preparation, and verifies data integrity. It uses standard mocking and patching techniques without any obfuscation or malicious behavior. No external data, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. The code's operations are contained within a controlled test environment, with no signs of backdoors, code injection, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard testing script for tensorflow_datasets with no malicious intent or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), reflecting its benign, testing nature.",
