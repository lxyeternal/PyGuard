  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is primarily composed of import statements, license headers, and type alias definitions.\n- No dynamic code execution, input/output handling, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- The code does not handle untrusted data, perform cryptographic operations, or include any code that could be exploited.\n- The wildcard import from `type_utils` is common in type annotation modules and not inherently suspicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are evident.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- The purpose is consistent: setting up type annotations and importing modules for internal use within the TensorFlow Datasets library.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks are identified.\n- The code is standard, well-structured, and adheres to typical practices for such modules.\n\n**Scores and justification:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very low, which aligns with the analysis. Since there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent, a low risk score is justified.\n\n**Any discrepancies or suggestions:**\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are aligned with the code's nature.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a benign, standard setup module for type annotations in the TensorFlow Datasets project. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- No further action needed.",
