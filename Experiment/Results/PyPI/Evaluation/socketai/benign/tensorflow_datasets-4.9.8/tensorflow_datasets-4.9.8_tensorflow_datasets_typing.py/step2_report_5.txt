  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of import statements and type alias definitions for the TensorFlow Datasets library.\n- It includes license headers, standard imports, and a wildcard import from `type_utils`.\n- There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No untrusted input sources, output sinks, or external data handling are present.\n- The code is static, primarily setting up type annotations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of code:** The code is purely import statements and type alias definitions; no malicious or suspicious code behavior is evident.\n- **Malware:** Score of 0 in all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risks:** No evidence of security risks beyond standard coding practices.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n\n- **Wildcard import (`from tensorflow_datasets.core.utils.type_utils import *`)**: While common in some type annotation modules, wildcard imports can sometimes be risky as they pollute the namespace. However, in this context, it appears to be a controlled, internal pattern for exposing multiple symbols, not an attack vector.\n\n### Evaluation of scores:\n\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, code is clear.\n- **Risk score (0):** Correct, no security risks are evident.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n\n- None needed; the code is benign and static.\n\n### Consistency check:\n\n- All reports are consistent in scoring and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign module for setting up type annotations within the TensorFlow Datasets library. No malicious or suspicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is safe, straightforward, and free of security risks.\n- The import patterns and structure are typical for a type annotation setup.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary based on the provided analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:** All scores remain at 0, with high confidence that the code is benign.",
