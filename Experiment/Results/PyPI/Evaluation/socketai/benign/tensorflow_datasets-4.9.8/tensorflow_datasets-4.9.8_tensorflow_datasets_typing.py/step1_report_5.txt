  "purpose": "Define type annotations and import necessary modules for TensorFlow Datasets components.",
  "sources": "Imports from etils, tensorflow_datasets.core, and tensorflow_datasets.core.utils modules, including partial_decode, feature, splits, and type_utils.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked; no I/O, network, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly static type definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import from type_utils is potentially risky but standard in some codebases; no suspicious or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines type aliases for internal use in TensorFlow Datasets. There are no input/output operations, no network communication, and no data handling beyond static type annotations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The wildcard import from type_utils is typical for exposing multiple symbols but not suspicious here. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward, benign module for type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type annotation and import setup module for TensorFlow Datasets. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security risks. The overall security risk score is very low.",
