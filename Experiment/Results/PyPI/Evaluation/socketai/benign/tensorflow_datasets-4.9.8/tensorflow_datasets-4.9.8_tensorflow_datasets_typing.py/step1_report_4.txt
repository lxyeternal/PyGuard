  "purpose": "Define type annotations and import relevant modules for TensorFlow Datasets, specifically related to decoding, splitting, features, and utils.",
  "sources": "Imports from etils and tensorflow_datasets.core modules, including partial_decode, feature, splits, and type_utils.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only imports modules and defines type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; purely static import and type alias definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; standard import statements, license, and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, license headers, and type alias definitions for the TensorFlow Datasets library. It imports modules related to decoding, features, splits, and utility types. There are no functions, data handling, or external inputs processed here. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or network communication are present. The wildcard import from 'type_utils' is common in internal modules and not suspicious in this context. Overall, this appears to be standard, benign code for setting up type annotations and imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module for type annotations and imports within the TensorFlow Datasets project. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks. It is a normal part of the codebase setup.",
