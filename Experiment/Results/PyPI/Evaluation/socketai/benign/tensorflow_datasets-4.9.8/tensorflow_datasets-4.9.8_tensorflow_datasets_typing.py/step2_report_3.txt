  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup for type annotations and module imports within the TensorFlow Datasets library.\n- No input/output operations, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- Wildcard import from `type_utils` is common in internal modules and not inherently suspicious here.\n- No hardcoded secrets, external data handling, or other security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code only imports modules and defines type aliases.\n- The use of `partial_decode.DecoderArg` and similar types is standard for setting up type annotations.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Malware score: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score: All assign 0, consistent with no obfuscation detected.\n- Risk score: All assign 0 or very low, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No need to adjust scores; they reflect the benign assessment accurately.\n- The justification for low risk and malware scores is sound.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, benign module for setting up type annotations and imports.\n- No security concerns or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The scores and reasoning are appropriate.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- Malware: **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- Obfuscated: **0** (no obfuscation)\n- Risk: **0** (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
