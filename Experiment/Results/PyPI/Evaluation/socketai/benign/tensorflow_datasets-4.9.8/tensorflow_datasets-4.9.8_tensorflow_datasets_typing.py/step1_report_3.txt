  "purpose": "Define typing annotations and import dependencies for TensorFlow Datasets.",
  "sources": "Imports from etils, tensorflow_datasets.core, and tensorflow_datasets.core.utils; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no flow of untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists of standard imports and type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type aliases and imports for the TensorFlow Datasets library. It imports modules and types from established, well-known packages without executing any dynamic or risky code. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The wildcard import from type_utils is a common practice in type annotations, not suspicious in this context. The code does not perform any I/O, network activity, or cryptographic operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module for type annotations and imports, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
