  "purpose": "Define type annotations and import necessary modules for TensorFlow Datasets, primarily for internal use within the library.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'etils' and 'tensorflow_datasets.core' modules, and use of the 'partial_decode' object from 'decode'.",
  "sinks": "No clear sink vulnerabilities; no untrusted data processing or external output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily imports and defines type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward, mainly import statements and type alias definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines type aliases for use in TensorFlow Datasets. It disables certain pylint warnings, which is standard practice in some codebases. There are no data processing, input/output operations, or network calls that could be exploited. The code does not execute any dynamic code, use eval/exec, or handle untrusted input. Overall, it appears to be a safe, purely structural code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for type annotations and module imports within the TensorFlow Datasets library. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
