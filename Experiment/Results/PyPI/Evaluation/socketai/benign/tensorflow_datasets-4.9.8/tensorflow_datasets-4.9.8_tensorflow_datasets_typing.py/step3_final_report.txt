{
  "purpose": "Setup module for type annotations and imports within the TensorFlow Datasets library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from etils, tensorflow_datasets.core, and tensorflow_datasets.core.utils; wildcard import from type_utils.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input/output, network activity, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Static import of modules and type alias definitions; no data flow or execution beyond import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import from type_utils, which is common in internal modules but can be risky in other contexts; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license headers, import statements, and type alias definitions. It does not process data, execute code dynamically, or perform network operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The wildcard import from type_utils is standard in such setup modules and not inherently suspicious. The code's purpose is to facilitate type annotations within the library. Given these factors, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup module for type annotations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are justified and accurate.",
