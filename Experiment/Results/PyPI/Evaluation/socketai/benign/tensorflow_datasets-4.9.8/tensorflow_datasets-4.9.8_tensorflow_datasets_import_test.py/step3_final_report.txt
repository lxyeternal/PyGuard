  "purpose": "A minimal test script to verify import of tensorflow_datasets library.",
  "sources": "Import statement for tensorflow_datasets; class definition; main guard calling tfds.testing.test_main()",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, network calls, or external data sources",
  "flows": "Import leads to class definition; main guard triggers test_main() with no data flow or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "Empty test method; no actual test logic; no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, benign test script with no malicious or security-related behavior. It imports a library, defines an empty test class, and runs a test main function. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, no network activity, no secrets, and no obfuscation are present. The code structure is standard for a unit test setup. All signals indicate a safe, non-malicious script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal test script with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard and harmless, with no signs of supply chain threats or malicious behavior.",
