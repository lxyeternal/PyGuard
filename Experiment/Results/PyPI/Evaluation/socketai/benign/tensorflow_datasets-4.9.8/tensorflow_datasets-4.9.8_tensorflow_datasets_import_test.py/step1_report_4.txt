{
  "purpose": "The code is a simple test script for the TensorFlow Datasets library, specifically testing the import functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement for tensorflow_datasets as tfds; test_main() function call in the main block",
  "sinks": "None that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; no data handling or network operations present",
  "flows": "Import of tfds module, execution of test_main() which runs tests defined in the TensorFlow Datasets testing framework",
  "anomalies": "The test_import method does nothing and serves as a placeholder; no suspicious or unusual code present",
  "analysis": "The code imports the tensorflow_datasets library and defines a test class with an empty test method. The main block executes tfds.testing.test_main(), likely to run a test suite. The structure is typical for testing in Python and contains no signs of malicious behavior, hidden code, or supply chain threats.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, minimal test setup for TensorFlow Datasets, with no malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks detected.",
