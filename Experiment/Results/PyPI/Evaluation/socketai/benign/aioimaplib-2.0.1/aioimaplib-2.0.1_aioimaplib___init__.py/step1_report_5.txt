  "purpose": "To provide an IMAPv4 client library using Python's asyncio framework.",
  "sources": "The code imports a local module '.aioimaplib'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present; no untrusted data handling is shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard license header and a module import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a license header and a single import statement from a local module. There are no functions, data processing, or untrusted data sources present. The license header indicates open-source distribution and does not suggest malicious intent. The import statement simply includes functionality from a local module, which itself could contain risks, but this cannot be determined from the snippet. Overall, the code appears to be standard, benign, and does not contain suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard open-source license header and a module import with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. There are no suspicious elements or data flows indicating malicious intent.",
