  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the provided scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports identify the code as a header/license and a simple import statement.\n- No executable code, data flows, or dynamic behavior are present.\n- The import is from a local module (`.aioimaplib`), which alone does not imply malicious intent.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n- The only minor concern is the wildcard import (`from .aioimaplib import *`), which can be risky for maintainability but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Specific report review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, correctly states the benign nature.\n- Scores are consistent.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion, no anomalies.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Notes the wildcard import as a minor concern but not malicious.\n- Confidence slightly reduced to 0.9, which is reasonable.\n- Security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minor maintainability concern, not a security issue.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, with no suspicious elements.\n- Scores are consistent.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0 or very close, reflecting no real security risk.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the content.\n- The only minor point is the wildcard import, which could be flagged for maintainability but not security.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to wildcard import concern, but not security-related)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the code fragment is benign. The scores are justified and aligned with the content.",
