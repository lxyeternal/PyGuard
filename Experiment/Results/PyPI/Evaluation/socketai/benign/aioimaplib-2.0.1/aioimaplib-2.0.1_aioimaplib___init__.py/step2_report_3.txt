  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is just licensing comments and an import statement.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. The report correctly identifies the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. This seems appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or suspicious code detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Similar to Report 1, only licensing and import.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No, just header and import.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** Slight concern due to wildcard import (`from .aioimaplib import *`), which can lead to namespace pollution or maintenance issues but is not inherently malicious.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** The report notes this as a minor concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. This seems reasonable, given the minor risk associated with wildcard imports.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, just a potential maintainability concern.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No, standard license header and import.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, non-obfuscated code.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0, with one assigning 0.1 due to the wildcard import. This is reasonable; wildcard imports can be considered a minor security or maintainability concern but not a significant risk.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minor concern due to wildcard import, but not a security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code fragment is benign, primarily consisting of licensing comments and a module import, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
