  "purpose": "Header comments with licensing information and a local module import statement.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .aioimaplib import *'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code contains only comments and an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') which can impact maintainability but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal header with licensing comments and a single import from a local module. There are no executable functions, data handling, network activity, or suspicious constructs. The wildcard import is a minor maintainability concern but does not indicate malicious behavior. No obfuscation or anomalies are present. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code fragment is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the wildcard import, which could affect maintainability but not security. The overall security risk is negligible.",
