  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is just a header with licensing comments and an import statement (`from .aioimaplib import *`). No data flows, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, just licensing and import.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; risk is 0.\n- **Comments:** Accurate assessment; no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, minimal header, import statement.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; risk is 0.\n- **Comments:** Correctly identifies no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Slightly more detail; notes that wildcard import (`from .aioimaplib import *`) can be risky in larger codebases but not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1.\n- **Analysis:** The slight increase in risk score reflects the potential maintainability concern with wildcard imports, not malicious behavior.\n- **Comments:** The assessment is reasonable; no malware indicated.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard header and import.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- **Comments:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None of the snippets contain any executable code, data handling, or network activity. The import of a local module alone does not imply malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports appropriately assign a very low or zero risk score, given the limited code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely a header with licensing and a module import. No data flows, no untrusted input, no network activity.\n- The wildcard import (`from .aioimaplib import *`) is a minor concern but not malicious.\n- No evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n\n### Suggested Final Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to wildcard import, which could affect maintainability but not security)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor risk score reflects maintainability concerns rather than security threats.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** I concur with the existing assessments, with a slight adjustment to the risk score to acknowledge the wildcard import as a maintainability concern but not a security risk.",
