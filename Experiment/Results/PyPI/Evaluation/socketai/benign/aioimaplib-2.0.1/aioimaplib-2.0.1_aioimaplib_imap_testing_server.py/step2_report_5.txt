  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a mock IMAP server intended for testing.\n- No mention of hardcoded secrets, external malicious connections, or suspicious behaviors.\n- All recognize the use of standard libraries and asyncio for asynchronous network operations.\n- The email handling appears standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n- The malware scores are all 0, and security risks are very low (around 0.1 to 0.2).\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's security posture:\n\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Sensitive data:** No hardcoded credentials or secrets.\n- **External connections:** Only local network (localhost), no external domains.\n- **Functionality:** Strictly a test/mock server, with email storage and IMAP command simulation.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The code handles email creation, storage, and IMAP command responses securely and in a standard manner.\n- The responses are appropriate for a mock server, with no dangerous or unexpected behavior.\n- The email creation uses the email library without suspicious modifications.\n- No dynamic code execution or unvalidated input handling that could lead to code injection.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are reasonable.\n- The high confidence levels (0.9-0.95) are justified given the thorough analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary; all assessments are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final personal estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — clear, standard code.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, due to the server being a testing environment, but potential for untrusted email content exists in a real scenario. However, since it's a mock server, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a legitimate, standard mock IMAP server implementation intended solely for testing. It does not contain malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk components. The existing report scores and conclusions are accurate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, benign, and suitable for testing environments. No further action needed.",
