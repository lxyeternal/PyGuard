{
  "purpose": "A mock IMAP server for testing email client implementations, handling standard IMAP commands and in-memory email storage.",
  "sources": "Network data received over asyncio transport, email creation via email library, user input commands.",
  "sinks": "Responses sent over network transport, email stored in in-memory data structures.",
  "flows": "Input commands from network -> command handlers process data -> responses sent back over network; email messages created and stored in memory.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or external malicious connections detected; standard libraries used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard, benign mock IMAP server primarily for testing purposes. It handles email storage, command processing, and network communication securely within memory. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with its intended testing function and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured mock IMAP server with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It poses minimal security risk and is suitable for testing environments. The provided scores accurately reflect its benign and low-risk profile.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
