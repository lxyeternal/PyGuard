  "purpose": "The source code provides functions for curve and surface interpolation and approximation using B-splines, based on algorithms from The NURBS Book. It focuses on mathematical computations for generating NURBS representations from data points.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data points from function parameters (e.g., points, size_u, size_v), and computes parameters and knot vectors internally. It also uses external modules (BSpline, helpers, linalg) for calculations. No external untrusted data sources or user inputs are directly read.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources, nor does it perform network communication or file I/O. The primary operations are mathematical computations in memory, and the only potential concern could be the use of external libraries.",
  "flows": "Input data points are processed through functions like compute_params_curve and compute_params_surface to generate parameters, which are then used to build coefficient matrices and solve linear systems (linalg.lu_solve, linalg.forward_substitution, linalg.backward_substitution). The control points are calculated and assigned, and finally, B-spline objects are created and returned. No untrusted data is propagated outside these computations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code performs standard mathematical operations, including solving linear systems, computing basis functions, and constructing knot vectors. All these operations are typical for B-spline computations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements established algorithms for B-spline curve and surface interpolation/approximation. It includes functions for computing knot vectors, parameters, and assembling coefficient matrices. The linear algebra operations (LU decomposition, solving linear systems) are standard. No indications of obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system commands, or network activity are present. The only potential concern might be the use of external modules, but their purpose appears to be mathematical and safe. The code's structure and logic are consistent with typical geometric modeling functions.",
  "conclusion": "The source code appears to be a standard implementation of B-spline interpolation and approximation algorithms. There are no signs of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or security risks. It uses mathematical methods for generating curves and surfaces from data points, aligning with its stated purpose. The code is safe for use within a geometric modeling or CAD context.",
