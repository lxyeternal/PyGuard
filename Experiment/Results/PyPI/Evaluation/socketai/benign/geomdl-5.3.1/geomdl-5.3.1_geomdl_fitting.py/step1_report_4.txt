{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for curve and surface interpolation and approximation using B-splines, including knot vector computation, parameter calculation, and control point generation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data points, parameters, and keyword arguments such as 'centripetal', 'ctrlpts_size', 'ctrlpts_size_u', and 'ctrlpts_size_v'.",
  "sinks": "Uses data points for mathematical computations; no untrusted data is directly used in system commands, network connections, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input data points -> parameter and knot vector calculations -> coefficient matrix construction -> linear algebra solutions -> control points generation -> output spline objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard mathematical operations and linear algebra routines. No network or file I/O involved. The function '_build_coeff_matrix_ders' is unimplemented but does not contain malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically implements B-spline interpolation and approximation algorithms based on the NURBS book, involving parameter computation, knot vector generation, and solving linear systems for control points. It uses standard linear algebra routines and mathematical functions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, code injection, or hidden behaviors. The unimplemented '_build_coeff_matrix_ders' function suggests planned but incomplete features, not malicious intent. All external functions seem to perform mathematical operations without side effects. No suspicious behaviors such as network access, system modification, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate mathematical implementation of B-spline interpolation and approximation algorithms with no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. It solely performs mathematical computations, with no external side effects or malicious features identified.",
