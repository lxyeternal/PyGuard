  "purpose": "Implementation of B-spline curve and surface interpolation and approximation algorithms based on 'The NURBS Book', using linear algebra routines for control point computation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data points, parameters, and basis functions; no external data sources or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Performs in-memory computations; no external data exfiltration, network activity, or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input points through parameter and knot vector computations into linear algebra routines that produce control points and spline objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns; placeholder functions are unimplemented but benign; code is straightforward and relies on standard algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard B-spline interpolation and approximation algorithms as described in 'The NURBS Book'. It uses well-established routines for basis functions, knot vector computation, and linear algebra solutions. No external system interactions, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The placeholder function '_build_coeff_matrix_ders' is unimplemented but not malicious. The control flow is typical for such mathematical routines, and no suspicious patterns or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of B-spline algorithms with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing low scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate given the code's mathematical nature and lack of external threats.",
