{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for curve and surface interpolation and approximation using B-Splines, based on algorithms from The NURBS Book, for geometric modeling.",
  "sources": "Functions reading data points (points, uk, vl, params), particularly in compute_params_curve, compute_params_surface, and data inputs to the interpolation and approximation functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks that write untrusted data to external systems or network. It uses linear algebra operations internally, and all data is handled within the scope of mathematical processing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input points through parameter computations, knot vector calculations, matrix assembly, and linear algebra solving routines, ultimately producing B-spline curve or surface objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code relies on external linear algebra and helper modules; no eval, exec, or dynamic code execution found. No obfuscation or suspicious imports observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geometric modeling computations based on well-documented algorithms for B-spline interpolation and approximation. All functions process data in a predictable manner, with no indication of malicious intent. External modules (linalg, helpers, BSpline) are assumed to be trusted libraries implementing linear algebra and basis functions. No network operations, file I/O, or suspicious system calls are present. The code appears clean, with no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of geometric interpolation and approximation algorithms with no evident malicious or sabotage behavior. It is consistent with its purpose of modeling and does not contain malware or security risks. The overall security risk is low.",
