  "purpose": "Helper functions for evaluating and manipulating curves and surfaces, including tangent and normal calculations, control point retrieval, and curve linking.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as 'obj', 'uv', 'param_list', 'curve', 'surf', and input arguments like 't', 't_u', 't_v' that provide data for calculations.",
  "sinks": "Return statements output points, vectors, and control point arrays; potential data flows into external functions or visualization tools.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to compute derivatives, normalize vectors, or retrieve control points, then results are returned; the 'link_curves' function validates control points and concatenates knot vectors and control points.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No code injection, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises geometric calculations for curves and surfaces, involving derivatives, normalization, cross products, and control point retrieval. It employs standard mathematical procedures and external helper functions for span calculation and point distance. The 'link_curves' function performs validation of control points' continuity with an optional tolerance. No input/output that suggests data exfiltration, system modification, or malicious activity is found. The code's structure and functions are typical for a geometric library, and there are no indications of hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard geometric utility library for NURBS curves and surfaces, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It performs expected operations for mathematical modeling, with safe validation and control point handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
