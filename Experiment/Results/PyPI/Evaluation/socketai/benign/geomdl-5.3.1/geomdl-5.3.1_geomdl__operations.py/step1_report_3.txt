  "purpose": "Helper functions for evaluating and manipulating curves and surfaces in a geometric modeling context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'obj', 'uv', 'param_list', 't', and curve/surface control points, knot vectors, and derivatives.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows from input parameters to derivative calculations, vector normalization, and control point manipulations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to compute derivatives and vectors; control points are retrieved based on span calculations; no untrusted data is directly sent elsewhere or over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of mathematical operations like vector normalization and cross product are standard. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no suspicious string operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides geometric computation functions, including tangent and normal vector evaluations on curves and surfaces, control point extraction, and curve linking. It uses standard mathematical and geometric operations (derivatives, normalization, cross products) and references external libraries for linear algebra. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access. The functions accept external inputs but perform standard geometric calculations without any suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard geometric utility module with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It does not contain malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. It is a straightforward implementation of geometric calculations for 3D modeling or CAD purposes.",
