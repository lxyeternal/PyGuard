{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for evaluating curves and surfaces, finding control points, linking curves, and other geometric operations in a computational geometry context, likely for NURBS-based modeling.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from object properties such as 'derivatives', 'ctrlpts', 'knotvector', and 'weights'. Function parameters such as 'obj', 'uv', 'param_list', 't', and curve/surface objects serve as sources.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially influence control point manipulations or parameter evaluations, but there are no direct sinks like system calls, network operations, or file writes. No unsafe code execution or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and object attributes into derivative calculations, vector normalizations, cross products, and control point selections, with no external or untrusted data influencing system commands or external services.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are detected. The code relies on standard geometric computations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code is present. The use of generic functions and object properties appears typical for geometric processing.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs geometric calculations involving derivatives, control points, and vector operations typical of NURBS evaluation. It uses external helper functions for span calculations and vector operations, with no apparent attempt at code obfuscation or malicious activity. Input parameters are standard for geometric functions, and control point linkages are checked against tolerances. No network, file, or system modifications are present. The code appears to be a typical geometric utility module without any suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured geometric utility module for NURBS curve and surface evaluations. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs mathematical and geometric operations based on provided object attributes and parameters. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
