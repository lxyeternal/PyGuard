  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate geometric utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Security risk is minimal, and malware score is zero. The low risk score (~0.1) is justified by the absence of external system interactions and the mathematical nature of the functions. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in modeling applications."
