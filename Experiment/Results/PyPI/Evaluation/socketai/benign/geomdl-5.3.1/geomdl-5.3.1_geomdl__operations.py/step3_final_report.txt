{
  "purpose": "Provides geometric utility functions for NURBS curves and surfaces, including derivatives, tangent, normal calculations, control point retrieval, and curve linking.",
  "sources": "Object properties such as 'derivatives', 'ctrlpts', 'weights', 'knotvector', 'knotvector_u', 'knotvector_v', 'ctrlpts2d', and input parameters like 'u', 'v', 't', 't_u', 't_v', 'uv', 'param_list', 't', and 'args'.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; computations are internal and do not perform I/O or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from object properties and input parameters through mathematical operations to outputs; no external or untrusted data flows to system or network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geometric computations for NURBS evaluation, including derivatives, vector normalization, cross products, control point extraction, and curve linking with validation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or external system interaction is present. Validation in 'link_curves' ensures control point continuity within a tolerance. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and typical for CAD or modeling libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate geometric utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Security risk is minimal, and malware score is zero. The low risk score (~0.1) is justified by the absence of external system interactions and the mathematical nature of the functions. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in modeling applications.",
