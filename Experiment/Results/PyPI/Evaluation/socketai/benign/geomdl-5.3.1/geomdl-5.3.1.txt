      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup script for a Python package. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality."

The small security risk score (~0.1) assigned in some reports is appropriate, reflecting the potential for cache poisoning if untrusted input is used as cache keys, but this is a common, known issue rather than malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate geometric utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Security risk is minimal, and malware score is zero. The low risk score (~0.1) is justified by the absence of external system interactions and the mathematical nature of the functions. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in modeling applications."

The use of randomness is safe and appropriate. The security risk is very low, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscated score is 0. The overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to geometric randomness but no security concerns."

The import from '_utilities' is typical for modular code and does not pose an immediate threat. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero. The minimal concern regarding the import source suggests a risk score of approximately 0.1, but given the evidence, it remains very low."
