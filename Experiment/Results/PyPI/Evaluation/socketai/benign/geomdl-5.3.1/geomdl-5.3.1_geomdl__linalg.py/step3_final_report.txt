{
  "purpose": "Implement LU decomposition using Doolittle's method for square matrices.",
  "sources": "Input matrix 'matrix_a' provided as a list or tuple.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network, or file I/O; computations are internal.",
  "flows": "Reads 'matrix_a' elements; computes 'matrix_l' and 'matrix_u' via nested loops; handles division by zero during LU factorization.",
  "anomalies": "Handles zero pivot elements by setting corresponding 'matrix_l' entries to zero; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard LU decomposition with proper handling of division by zero errors. It does not access external data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. The division by zero handling is a numerical safeguard, not malicious. The code is straightforward and mathematically oriented, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of LU decomposition with no malicious activity or security risks. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
