  "purpose": "Helper function for LU-factorization using Doolittle's method in linear algebra calculations.",
  "sources": "Input matrix_a provided as a parameter to the doolittle function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; function performs calculations only.",
  "flows": "Input matrix_a → matrix_l, matrix_u calculations within doolittle function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard LU decomposition algorithm for square matrices, using straightforward nested loops and basic arithmetic operations. It does not include external data access beyond function parameters, nor does it perform network or file operations. The code does not contain obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or suspicious logic. It appears to be a typical scientific computing utility function with proper handling of division by zero, assigning zero in case of division errors. There are no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard linear algebra helper function with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It performs LU decomposition purely for computational purposes.",
