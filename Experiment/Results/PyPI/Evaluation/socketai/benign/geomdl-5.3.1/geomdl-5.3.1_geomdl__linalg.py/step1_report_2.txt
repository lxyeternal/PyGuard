  "purpose": "Helper functions for linear algebra module, specifically implementing Doolittle's LU factorization method.",
  "sources": "No input sources reading untrusted data; the function takes a matrix as a parameter, which is assumed to be provided by the caller.",
  "sinks": "The code performs mathematical calculations and returns matrices; it does not write or transmit data, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "Input matrix -> LU decomposition calculations -> Output matrices L and U",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code uses standard numerical algorithms without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard LU decomposition using Doolittle's method, with proper handling of zero division errors. It does not perform any network operations, file access, or external data manipulation. It is a straightforward mathematical implementation intended for internal computations within the module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of LU factorization without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No malware or security risks are detected.",
