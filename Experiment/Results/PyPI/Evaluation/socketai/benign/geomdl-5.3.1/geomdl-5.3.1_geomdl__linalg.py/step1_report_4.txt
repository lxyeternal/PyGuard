  "purpose": "Provide a helper function implementing Doolittle's LU-factorization method for linear algebra computations.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'matrix_a' for the matrix to factorize.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Input 'matrix_a' flows into the function and is used to compute matrices L and U.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward mathematical computation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function for LU-factorization using Doolittle's method. It initializes matrices, performs standard LU decomposition steps, and handles potential division by zero with try-except. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It does not involve network, file I/O, or execution of external commands. The code is clean, well-structured, and typical for a numerical library component.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a mathematical LU decomposition algorithm without malicious intent or security concerns. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious activity is evident.",
