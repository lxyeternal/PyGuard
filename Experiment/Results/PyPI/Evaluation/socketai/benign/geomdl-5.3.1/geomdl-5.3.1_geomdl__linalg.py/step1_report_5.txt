  "purpose": "Helper functions for linear algebra operations, specifically LU-factorization using Doolittle's Method.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or untrusted sources are read; the code processes input matrices provided as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or output to external systems; the function returns matrices after computations.",
  "flows": "Input matrix 'matrix_a' is used to compute matrices 'L' and 'U', which are then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard LU-factorization algorithm using Doolittle's method. It initializes matrices, performs iterative calculations, and handles potential division by zero errors explicitly. No external data sources, network activity, or file operations are present. The code appears to be a straightforward mathematical implementation with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard mathematical helper function for LU-factorization with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues. It performs basic computations and error handling safely.",
