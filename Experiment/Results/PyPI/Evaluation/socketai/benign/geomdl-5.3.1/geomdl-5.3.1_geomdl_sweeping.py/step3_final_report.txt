{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for sweeping spline geometries along a vector, generating swept surfaces or volumes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'obj' (spline geometry), 'vec' (vector to sweep along).",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or file I/O involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'obj' is validated, control points are translated via 'linalg.point_translate', deep copy of 'obj' is made, control points are updated, then 'construct.construct_surface' or 'construct.construct_volume' is called based on 'pdimension'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; straightforward geometric processing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geometric transformations with input validation, deep copying, and external module calls presumed safe. No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The logic is correct and consistent with typical geometry processing routines. External modules ('linalg', 'construct') are assumed secure. The security risk score of 0.1 in the reports is reasonable, though it could be lowered to 0 given the lack of external threats or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs expected geometric operations, and shows no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; minor adjustment to a risk score of 0 is recommended for clarity.",
