{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for generating swept geometries by sweeping spline geometries along a vector.",
  "sources": "The input parameters 'obj' and 'vec'; the import statements; the function parameters and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the construct.construct_surface and construct.construct_volume functions, which may process or generate geometry data.",
  "flows": "Input 'obj' and 'vec' are used to generate 'swept_cps', which is then used to create a deep copy of the original object, then control points are updated, and finally, the data flows into construct functions for surface or volume creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior; no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code observed. The code performs geometry transformations and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to sweep a spline geometry along a vector, involving translation of control points, deep copying of objects, and calling external construct functions. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or hidden behaviors are present. It relies on imported modules for linear algebra and construction but does not itself contain malicious behavior. The process appears to be straightforward geometry manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard geometry processing function with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It securely performs control point translation and geometry construction without suspicious activities.",
