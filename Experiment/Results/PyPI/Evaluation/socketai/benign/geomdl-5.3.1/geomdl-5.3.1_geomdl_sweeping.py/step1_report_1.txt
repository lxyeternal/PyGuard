{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for generating swept geometries by sweeping spline geometries along a vector.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: obj (spline geometry), vec (vector to sweep along).",
  "sinks": "Potential data flow from obj and vec to geometric transformations; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "obj and vec are used to generate control points, which are then transformed and used to construct new geometries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present. The code uses deep copies and geometric transformations which are standard for such applications.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and local modules, defines a function to sweep geometries along a vector. It performs input validation, translates control points, deep copies the object, updates control points, and constructs either a surface or volume depending on the input geometry dimension. All operations are typical for geometry processing, with no signs of malicious behavior. No network access, data exfiltration, or suspicious side-effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard geometric processing function with no malicious intent. It performs controlled data transformations relevant to its purpose, with no indications of malware or security risks.",
