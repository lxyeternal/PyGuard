{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for generating swept geometries by sweeping spline geometries along a vector.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters 'obj' (spline geometry) and 'vec' (vector to sweep along).",
  "sinks": "Uses 'deepcopy' on 'obj', calls 'linalg.point_translate', and 'construct.construct_surface/volume'.",
  "flows": "Input 'obj' is deep-copied, control points are translated, and the modified geometry is passed to construction functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious external connections, no obfuscated code. No use of untrusted data sources or sinks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to sweep spline geometries along a vector. It performs input validation, control point translation via an imported linear algebra utility, deep copies the input geometry, updates its control points, and then constructs either a surface or volume based on the geometry's dimension. All operations involve standard data handling and calls to presumably safe, well-defined modules. There is no indication of malicious behavior, no hidden network activity, or data exfiltration points.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of geometry processing with no malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external modules for core operations, which are assumed safe. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
