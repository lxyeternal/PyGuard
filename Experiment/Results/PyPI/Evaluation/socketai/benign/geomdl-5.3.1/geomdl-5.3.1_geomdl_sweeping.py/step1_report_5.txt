{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for generating swept geometries by translating spline geometries along a vector.",
  "sources": "The function reads input parameters 'obj' (a spline geometry object) and 'vec' (a list or tuple).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that lead to potential data leaks or security effects; it mainly processes geometric data.",
  "flows": "The source 'obj' is used to generate a translated version 'obj_swept'; no external untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on external libraries for geometric processing.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the dimension of the input geometry, translates control points via linalg.point_translate, and deep copies the geometry object. It then updates the control points and constructs a swept surface or volume. No external untrusted data is used insecurely; the operations are geometric transformations with no external command execution or network activity. The code appears straightforward and well-structured, with no malicious behavior or security issues identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard geometric transformation function with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any dangerous operations such as network access, data exfiltration, or code execution. The overall security risk is negligible.",
