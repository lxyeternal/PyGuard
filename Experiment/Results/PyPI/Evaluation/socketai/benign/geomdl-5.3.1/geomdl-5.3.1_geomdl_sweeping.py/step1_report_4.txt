{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for generating swept geometries by translating spline geometries along a specified vector.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'obj' (spline geometry), 'vec' (vector to sweep along), and possibly the contents of 'kwargs'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially in the deepcopy() operation (if malicious code manipulates objects), but no direct untrusted data sink is apparent. No network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'obj' and 'vec' are used to compute new control points via linalg.point_translate. The modified control points are assigned to a deepcopy of 'obj', then passed to construct.construct_surface or construct.construct_volume.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. Usage of deepcopy is standard; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. No external network or system commands are invoked.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to sweep geometries along a vector, involving data copying, control point translation, and object construction. It relies on imported modules for linear algebra and construction. No data is read from external sources during execution; input data comes from function arguments. There are no apparent backdoors, hidden behaviors, or malicious payloads. The process appears straightforward and intended for geometric modeling.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard geometric operation without signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses conventional methods and safe operations, with no suspicious external interactions.",
