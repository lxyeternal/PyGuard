{
  "purpose": "Provides internal utility functions such as a metaclass decorator, a context manager for multiprocessing pools, and an export decorator for managing module exports.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, contextlib (contextmanager), and multiprocessing.Pool; no external or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data flows or potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; functions are utilities without input processing that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Functions follow standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility decorators and context managers commonly used in Python projects. The add_metaclass function is a standard implementation adapted from the 'six' library for Python 2/3 compatibility. The pool_context provides a safe context for multiprocessing pools, ensuring proper termination. The export decorator manages __all__ exports dynamically. All functions perform straightforward, well-understood tasks without malicious intent. No data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing standard utility functions with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It appears to be a normal part of a utility module in a larger codebase.",
