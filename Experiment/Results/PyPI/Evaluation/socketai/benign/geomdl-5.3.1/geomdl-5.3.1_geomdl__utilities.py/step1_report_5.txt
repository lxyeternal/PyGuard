{
  "purpose": "Defines internal utility functions for class metaclass creation, multiprocessing context management, and module export decoration.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports: sys, contextlib, multiprocessing.Pool",
  "sinks": "None present that directly lead to data leaks or malicious effects",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only manages class decoration, context management, and module attribute modification",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: 'add_metaclass' for creating classes with a specified metaclass, 'pool_context' as a context manager for multiprocessing pools, and 'export' to manage __all__ exports of functions. All functions rely on standard library modules and contain no embedded or hidden malicious logic. No data is read from untrusted sources, nor are there any sinks that could lead to malicious actions. The code appears to serve common utility purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward utility code with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard tasks and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
