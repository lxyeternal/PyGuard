{
  "purpose": "Provides internal utility functions such as class metaclass decorator, multiprocessing pool context manager, and an export decorator.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, contextlib (for contextmanager), and multiprocessing.Pool.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; functions are utility wrappers and decorators.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard utility functions with clear purposes: adding metaclasses to classes, managing multiprocessing pools with proper cleanup, and exporting functions by appending to module's __all__. No external data sources, user input, or network interactions are involved. No signs of malicious or suspicious activities, code injection, or data exfiltration. The code adheres to common patterns and includes licensing references, with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides benign utility functions intended for internal use. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code appears safe and straightforward.",
