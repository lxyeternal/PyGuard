{
  "purpose": "Provides internal utility functions for class metaclass assignment, context management for multiprocessing, and module export handling.",
  "sources": "sys.modules, class definitions, context managers, and function decorators",
  "sinks": "None detected; no direct data leakage or untrusted data processing identified",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; functions are utility-based",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Usage of standard libraries and patterns. No obfuscation or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions: add_metaclass for class creation with a metaclass, pool_context as a context manager for multiprocessing pools, and export to manage module exports. All functions use standard, well-documented patterns without suspicious behavior. No malicious payloads, hidden network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be safe and intended solely for internal utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This module contains benign utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It employs standard practices for class decorators, multiprocessing context management, and module exports.",
