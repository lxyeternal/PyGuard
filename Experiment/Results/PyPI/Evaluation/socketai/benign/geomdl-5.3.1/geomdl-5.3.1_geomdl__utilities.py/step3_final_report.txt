  "purpose": "Utility functions for class metaclass assignment, multiprocessing pool context management, and module export handling.",
  "sources": "Standard library modules: sys, contextlib, multiprocessing",
  "sinks": "None; functions do not process untrusted data or perform harmful actions",
  "flows": "No external data flows; functions operate on internal data and module attributes",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code follows standard patterns without suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code comprises well-documented utility functions: add_metaclass (for metaclass assignment), pool_context (context manager for multiprocessing.Pool), and export (decorator for managing __all__). All are implemented using standard libraries and common patterns. No external input, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The functions do not perform any insecure operations or data leaks. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior. The scores from all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard utility code with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor risk score of 0.1 in one report is acceptable but could be lowered to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
