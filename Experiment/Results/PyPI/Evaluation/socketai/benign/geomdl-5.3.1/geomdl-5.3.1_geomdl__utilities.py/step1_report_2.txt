{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for class metaclass assignment, multiprocessing context management, and module exportation.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, contextlib (contextmanager), multiprocessing (Pool); uses sys.modules and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "sys.modules (modifying __all__), Pool (creating processes), function decorators (add_metaclass, export).",
  "flows": "Functions like add_metaclass modify class definitions; pool_context manages process pools; export modifies module __all__ list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns detected. Usage of standard library modules and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions without executing untrusted input or external data. The add_metaclass decorator modifies class attributes for compatibility; pool_context manages multiprocessing pools safely; export registers functions for export by modifying __all__.\nNo code injection, data leaks, or malicious activities are present. The code is straightforward and uses common patterns, with no signs of backdoors or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign utility code implementing standard patterns for class creation, multiprocessing, and module exports. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected.",
