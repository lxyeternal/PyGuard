{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging and installing the NURBS-Python library, including optional Cython compilation of core modules.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily read from files such as '__init__.py' for metadata, and the command line arguments (sys.argv) for control flags.",
  "sinks": "The script interacts with the filesystem (creating, deleting files/directories), and executes setup commands based on user input. No untrusted data is used directly in security-critical operations.",
  "flows": "Command line arguments (sources) influence global flags (BUILD_FROM_CYTHON, BUILD_FROM_SOURCE), which determine the creation and compilation of extensions. File reading (from __init__.py) supplies metadata for packaging. Files are read and copied based on extensions. No dangerous data flows are observed.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or backdoors. The script performs standard setup operations, file manipulations, and optional Cython compilation. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with optional Cython compilation. It reads package metadata from __init__.py files, handles command line options for build modes, cleans build artifacts, and manages filesystem operations like creating directories and copying files. No suspicious behavior, external network interactions, or malicious payloads are detected. All operations are typical for a package build and installation process.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup configuration for the NURBS-Python package, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It manages build options, file operations, and package metadata safely. No malicious or maliciously suspicious behavior is identified.",
