{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the 'geomdl' Python package, managing build, installation, testing, and cleaning processes, including optional Cython compilation of modules.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata (__version__, __author__, __license__, __description__, __keywords__) from __init__.py files; reading files with specific extensions (.py, .c, .cpp) from project directories; user input via sys.argv for build options.",
  "sinks": "Execution of setup() which installs and builds the package; creation of directories and copying files; potential execution of code via dynamic extensions and compilation steps, but no untrusted data directly used in a security-sensitive context.",
  "flows": "Input options (command line arguments) influence build configuration and source compilation; reading of metadata and source files feeds into build process; no data flows into untrusted external systems or outputs that could leak data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of global variables to control build behavior; dynamic creation of extension modules based on file extensions; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are evident; extensive cleanup routines do not perform any suspicious file manipulations outside of build artifacts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard build setup script for a Python package with optional Cython compilation features. It reads package metadata and source files, manages build options via command line arguments, creates build directories, and cleans up build artifacts. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote control, or obfuscation. The operations are typical for a setup script, with no suspicious data flows or malicious actions detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for building and installing the 'geomdl' package with optional Cython support. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within the code provided.",
