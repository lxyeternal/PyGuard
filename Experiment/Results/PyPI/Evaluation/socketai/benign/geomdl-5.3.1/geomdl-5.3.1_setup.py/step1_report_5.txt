{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python library called 'geomdl', including optional Cython compilation for performance.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from __init__.py files, reads and copies source files (.py, .c, .cpp), and processes command line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses package metadata to set up the distribution; reads source files for compilation; potentially executes code based on command line arguments to control build process.",
  "flows": "Command line arguments influence build flags; source files are read and copied; optional Cython compilation occurs based on flags; package setup proceeds with collected data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors. The code primarily manages build and packaging processes. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for Python package distribution. It includes functions for reading package metadata, managing build options, cleaning build artifacts, and optionally compiling Cython modules. It processes command line arguments to determine whether to compile from source or via Cython, and handles directory and file operations securely. There are no signs of malicious activities, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The script’s structure is typical for package setup and build management, with clear and legitimate functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script with no evidence of malicious intent. It manages build configurations, cleans build artifacts, and prepares the package for distribution. No malicious behavior or sabotage is present.",
