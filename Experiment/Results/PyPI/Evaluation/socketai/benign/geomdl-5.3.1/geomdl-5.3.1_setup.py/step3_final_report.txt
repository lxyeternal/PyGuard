{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup configuration script for the 'geomdl' Python package, managing build, installation, testing, cleaning routines, and optional Cython compilation.",
  "sources": "Filesystem operations for reading, writing, copying, and deleting files and directories related to build artifacts and metadata.",
  "sinks": "File system modifications during build and cleanup; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Reading metadata from __init__.py; creating directories; copying source files; deleting build artifacts; configuring build extensions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no external communication or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks, including cleaning build artifacts, optionally compiling Cython extensions, and managing package metadata. It uses filesystem operations typical for build scripts and does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code. No external network activity or data leaks are present. The logic is straightforward and consistent with benign package management routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup script for a Python package. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
