{
  "purpose": "The script defines setup configurations for packaging and distributing the 'geomdl' Python library, including optional Cython compilation and clean-up routines.",
  "sources": "Reads files such as '__init__.py', 'DESCRIPTION.rst', and source code files within the 'geomdl' directory; accesses sys.argv for command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses shutil to delete directories and files; executes 'setup()' to install packages; reads and writes files for build configuration; dynamically imports modules like Cython.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments (sys.argv) influence build options; file reading functions extract package metadata; build steps generate or clean source files; setup() executes installation process.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic modification of sys.argv for build configuration; creates and deletes directories and files during clean commands; conditionally compiles code with Cython or from source; writes __init__.py with version, author, license info.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a standard setup script for Python package distribution, with routines to clean build artifacts, manage Cython compilation, and read package metadata. It does not include code that collects, transmits, or manipulates user data, nor does it connect to external servers. All file operations and module imports appear related to build and distribution processes. The dynamic handling of build options and directory creation is typical for packaging scripts. No suspicious network activity, hidden code, or malicious logic is evident. The script appears to focus on build management rather than executing any runtime code that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup configuration for the 'geomdl' package, with standard build, clean, and installation routines. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malicious code, or supply chain attacks. All operations are related to package management, and no suspicious activity is present.",
