{
  "purpose": "Implement a thread-safe, least-recently-used (LRU) cache decorator compatible with older Python versions.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports: functools, collections, threading. User-provided function via decorator.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions. The code primarily manages in-memory caching.",
  "flows": "Input from function arguments -> key generation -> cache lookup -> function execution -> cache update.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is a standard implementation of LRU caching.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom LRU cache decorator with thread safety features, using standard techniques such as linked lists and dictionaries. It includes workarounds for known Python bugs and provides methods for cache info and clearing. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present. The functions operate solely on in-memory data structures without network, file, or external system interaction. No code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are apparent. Usage of threading lock is standard for thread safety. Overall, it is a conventional, well-structured caching implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of an LRU cache decorator. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
