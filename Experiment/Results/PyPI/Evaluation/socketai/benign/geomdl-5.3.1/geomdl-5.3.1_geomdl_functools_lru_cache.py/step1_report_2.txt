{
  "purpose": "A backport implementation of functools.lru_cache to provide caching functionality for Python versions earlier than 3.3.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via function arguments passed to the cache-decorated functions. No external data sources are explicitly read within the code itself.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write data to external systems, files, or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow from the decorated functions into cache key generation, which then determines cache hits or misses. Results are stored in-memory within the cache dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for an LRU cache implementation, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code uses standard threading locks and data structures. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements an LRU caching decorator with configurable size and argument typing. It uses thread-safe mechanisms and maintains cache statistics. No external data sources, network communication, or file operations are present. The logic focuses solely on in-memory caching, which is typical and benign. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoor mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of an LRU cache decorator with no malicious behavior detected. It appears to be a legitimate library component designed to enhance performance in Python programs.",
