{
  "purpose": "A backport of functools.lru_cache for Python versions prior to 3.3, providing a thread-safe caching decorator with optional size limit and type sensitivity.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function arguments (args, kwds) for cache key creation and environment variables or external input only if used externally (none in this code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include cache storage (dictionary), where data is stored and retrieved based on function arguments; no data leaks or external data transmission are present.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are used to generate cache keys; these keys determine cache hits/misses and cache update operations. Cache information functions access internal statistics; cache clearing resets internal states.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The code is straightforward, implementing a standard LRU cache with thread safety. No backdoors or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a thread-safe LRU cache as a decorator, with proper handling of cache size, statistics, and cache clearing functions. Use of threading locks prevents race conditions. No external data transmission, no code injection, or suspicious behavior detected. The logic aligns with standard caching mechanisms and follows best practices. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-implemented LRU cache decorator intended for performance optimization in Python programs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
