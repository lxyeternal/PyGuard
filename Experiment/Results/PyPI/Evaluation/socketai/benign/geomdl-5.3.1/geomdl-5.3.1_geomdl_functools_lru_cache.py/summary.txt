  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a thread-safe LRU cache decorator. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The small security risk score (~0.1) assigned in some reports is appropriate, reflecting the potential for cache poisoning if untrusted input is used as cache keys, but this is a common, known issue rather than malicious activity."
