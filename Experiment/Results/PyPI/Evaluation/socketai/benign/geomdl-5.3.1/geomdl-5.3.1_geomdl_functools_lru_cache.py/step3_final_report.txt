  "purpose": "A thread-safe implementation of functools.lru_cache as a decorator, providing caching with optional size limit and thread safety.",
  "sources": "Function arguments used as cache keys, potentially from external input if passed by untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "In-memory cache storage; no external data or network operations are performed.",
  "flows": "Arguments are processed into cache keys; cache hits/misses update internal data structures; no external data flow or output occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Minor note: potential for cache poisoning if untrusted input is used as cache keys, but this is a known, documented risk in caching mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured, thread-safe LRU cache decorator. It uses internal data structures to manage cache entries, with no external system interactions, obfuscation, or malicious code. The cache key generation accounts for argument types and optional typing, with safeguards for thread safety. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The potential security concern about cache poisoning is acknowledged but not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a thread-safe LRU cache decorator. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The small security risk score (~0.1) assigned in some reports is appropriate, reflecting the potential for cache poisoning if untrusted input is used as cache keys, but this is a common, known issue rather than malicious activity.",
