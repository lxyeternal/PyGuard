  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-driven utility for control point grid generation with bump features. It contains no malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of randomness is safe and appropriate. The security risk is very low, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscated score is 0. The overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to geometric randomness but no security concerns."
