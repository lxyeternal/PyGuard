  "purpose": "Classes for generating control point grids for parametric surface modeling, including bump features and weighted control points.",
  "sources": "User parameters, method arguments, internal data structures (grid points, weights).",
  "sinks": "Internal modifications to grid points and weights; no external data leaks or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence grid and bump generation; internal data updates without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines geometric grid classes with methods for grid creation, bump placement, and weight management. It uses standard modules and internal utilities. Randomness is confined to bump placement, which is typical for geometric features. No external communication, code injection, or malicious behaviors are present. Input validation and warnings are appropriate. The code is clear, well-structured, and purpose-specific, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-driven utility for control point grid generation with bump features. It contains no malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of randomness is safe and appropriate. The security risk is very low, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscated score is 0. The overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to geometric randomness but no security concerns.",
