{
  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for surface trimming, mapping 2D trimming curves to 3D space, fixing trim curve connectivity and direction, and analyzing trim curves for closure and sense.",
  "sources": "Reads input geometry objects, trimming curves, evaluation points, and parameter space bounding boxes; also reads options like 'reversed' and 'delta'.",
  "sinks": "Generates new curves, container curves, and freeform objects; evaluates and manipulates curve points and control points; modifies object properties.",
  "flows": "Input geometry and trimming curves are processed through evaluation and geometric analysis functions; curves are reversed, extended, or converted; final curves are generated and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external communications observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Uses straightforward geometric computations. No network or system command usage.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of geometric processing functions for surface trimming, including mapping trims from 2D parametric space to 3D, fixing curve connectivity, and checking closure and sense. It employs standard mathematical operations, such as distance calculations, CCW detection, and intersection checks. The functions generate and manipulate curve objects and do not perform any external network access, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No use of dynamic code execution, malicious system calls, or hidden behaviors are present. The code appears to be clean, structured for geometric processing, and focused on geometry management without any signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a collection of geometry processing utilities related to surface trimming. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The functions operate on geometry data and generate new geometric objects without external side effects or suspicious activities.",
