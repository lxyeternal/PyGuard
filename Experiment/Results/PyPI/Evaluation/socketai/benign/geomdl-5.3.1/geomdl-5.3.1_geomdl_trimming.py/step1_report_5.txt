{
  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for surface trimming operations, including mapping trimming curves to 3D space and fixing curve directions and connectivity.",
  "sources": "Reads input geometry objects, trimming curve data, and evaluation points from surfaces and curves.",
  "sinks": "Generates new curve objects and modifies existing geometry; potential for untrusted data handling is minimal but could involve adding or modifying geometric data.",
  "flows": "Input geometry and trimming curves are evaluated; processed curves are either modified or replaced; new curves are generated and assigned back to geometry objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code manipulates geometric data for surface trimming without any network activity, system modification, or privacy leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manipulates geometric data structures for surface trimming, including mapping 2D trimming curves into 3D space, fixing curve directions, and connecting trims. It performs geometric calculations, curve reversals, and container management. No code indicates external data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious payloads. The functions rely on geometry processing libraries and standard math operations. No obfuscated code patterns, malicious imports, or hidden behaviors are observed. The logic is consistent with surface trimming operations and contains no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a geometric processing module for surface trimming, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles geometry data for surface trimming and correction without involving external communication or system modifications. The overall security risk is very low.",
