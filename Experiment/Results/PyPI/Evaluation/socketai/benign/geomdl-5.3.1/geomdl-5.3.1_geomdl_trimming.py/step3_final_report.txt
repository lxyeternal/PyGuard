{
  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for surface trimming, mapping 2D trim curves to 3D space, fixing curve directions, and analyzing curve sense and intersections within surface geometry processing.",
  "sources": "Geometry objects, trim curves, evaluation points, parameter space boundaries.",
  "sinks": "None; internal geometric computations without external data transfer or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input geometry and trim data flow through evaluation, reversal, and intersection functions to produce mapped curves and corrected trim configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external communication detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geometric operations such as evaluating points, reversing curves, detecting sense (clockwise/counter-clockwise), and checking intersections. It manipulates data structures for curves and trims without external I/O or network activity. The functions are well-structured, use common algorithms, and do not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward geometry processing module for surface trimming. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and low risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's purpose.",
