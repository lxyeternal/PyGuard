  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for surface trimming, mapping 2D trimming curves to 3D space, fixing trim curve issues, and analyzing trim curves' sense and intersections.",
  "sources": "Input geometry objects (obj), trim curves (curve), parameter space domain (domain), and evaluation points (evalpts).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no direct output to external systems, files, or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from geometry objects and trim curves to evaluation functions, with some analysis functions determining curve properties. No untrusted data is sent externally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code performs geometry processing, not data exfiltration or external connections. No obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code performs geometry processing tasks such as mapping trim curves from parametric to 3D space, fixing issues with curve directionality and connectivity, and analyzing curve sense and intersections. It uses standard math operations, list manipulations, and geometric computations. No network operations, file I/O, or external system calls are present. The functions rely on helper modules and classes, but no indication of malicious code or data leaks. The logic appears consistent with surface trimming operations, with no signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate geometry processing module with no malicious intent. It handles surface trimming, fixing, and analysis tasks using standard methods. There are no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The overall security risk is minimal.",
