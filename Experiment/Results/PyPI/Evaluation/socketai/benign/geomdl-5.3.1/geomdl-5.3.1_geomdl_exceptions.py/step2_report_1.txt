  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code is a straightforward custom exception class.\n- No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or external data handling.\n- Confidence: 1; Malware: 0; Security risk: 0.\n- No issues identified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, notes the import from a local utility module but finds no malicious intent.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still no signs of malicious activity.\n- No dangerous data flows or code execution.\n- Security risk is minimal (0.1), likely due to the import source.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates that the class is a simple exception with optional data.\n- No external input processing or unsafe operations.\n- Confidence: 1; Malware: 0; Security risk: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion: a benign exception class.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Confidence: 1; Malware: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous reports, no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- Proper exception class design.\n- Confidence: 1; Malware: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is a standard exception class with no malicious behavior. The import from `_utilities` could be scrutinized, but in the absence of evidence of malicious content, it is likely benign.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No obfuscated code detected; all reports confirm straightforward implementation.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  The code does not process untrusted input beyond storing message and data, and it does not perform unsafe operations. The only point of concern is the import from `_utilities`, which could be a vector if malicious, but no evidence supports this.\n\n- **Scores justification:**  \n  The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis. The security risk is minimal, given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (benign exception class, no security risks)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-implemented custom exception class for a Python library, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The import from `_utilities` warrants a review in the broader context, but on its own, it is typical for modular code.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- No changes needed to the scores based on the current evidence.\n- Continue monitoring the `_utilities` module for malicious content if concerns persist.\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the thorough review and the evidence at hand.",
