{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for handling geometric errors in a Python module.",
  "sources": "Imports from ._utilities, usage of class attributes and parameters.",
  "sinks": "The exception message and data can potentially be used in logs or outputs, but no direct sink for untrusted data is present.",
  "flows": "The exception can be raised with a message and optional data; the message is prefixed and stored, which could be displayed or logged.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward exception handling logic with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility for export, defines a constant error prefix, and creates a custom exception class that includes additional data. The class constructor prefixes the message with a constant and stores extra data. The code includes usage documentation and proper exception inheritance. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code structure is clean and adheres standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign custom exception class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to handle specific errors with optional additional data.",
