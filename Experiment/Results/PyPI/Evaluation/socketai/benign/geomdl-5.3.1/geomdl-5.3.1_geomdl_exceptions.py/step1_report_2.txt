{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for handling geometric errors in the 'geomdl' package.",
  "sources": "Imports from a relative module '_utilities', and the class constructor parameters 'msg' and 'data'.",
  "sinks": "The exception class could potentially be instantiated with untrusted input for 'msg' or 'data', but there are no unsafe operations or data leaks implemented.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input 'msg' and 'data' could flow into the exception object, but since the class only stores them and does not perform any unsafe operations, there are no harmful flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward, standard for custom exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class with an optional data attribute, which is common practice. The import from a relative module '_utilities' might be a point to review further for malicious content, but on its own, it is standard. There are no unsafe operations, no code injection, network activity, or malicious logic present. The exception message is prefixed with 'GEOMDL ERROR: ', which is a standard error handling pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom exception class for geometric errors, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply encapsulates error messages and optional data without performing any dangerous actions.",
