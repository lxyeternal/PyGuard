{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for geometric errors within a larger library or module.",
  "sources": "The code imports from a local utility module (_utilities), and sets a constant error prefix.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the class raises an exception with a message and optional data, but it does not process or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The flow involves raising an exception with a message and optional data, but there are no external data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical exception class patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class, GeomdlException, which inherits from Python's built-in Exception. It prepends a constant error prefix to the message and allows attaching additional data. The code imports a local utility for exporting, which is standard. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs, no external data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for error handling in a larger application.",
