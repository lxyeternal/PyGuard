{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for geometric errors in the 'geomdl' library.",
  "sources": "Import from a local module (.utilities), usage of class constructor (__init__ method).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data (msg, data) flows into the GeomdlException constructor; exception messages are constructed and stored.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code. The code is straightforward class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a custom exception class inheriting from Python's Exception. It takes a message and optional data, prefixes the message with a standard error string, and stores additional data. The import from a local module '_utilities' suggests some utility functions or decorators, but without malicious intent. No external network access, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code appears to serve a debugging or error handling purpose within a larger library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign class definition for custom exceptions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
