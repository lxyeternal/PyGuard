  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The import from '_utilities' is typical for modular code and does not pose an immediate threat. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero. The minimal concern regarding the import source suggests a risk score of approximately 0.1, but given the evidence, it remains very low."
