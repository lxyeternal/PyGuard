{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for geometric errors with optional data attachment.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports a utility module and uses internal constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; exception handling is standard.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward custom exception class with an optional data attribute, following standard Python practices. It imports a utility module for export functionality, which is typical in modular code. The exception class prepends a fixed error prefix to the message. No external input handling, no network operations, no suspicious code constructs. The code appears to be purely for defining a specific exception type.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module defining a custom exception class. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code fragment.",
