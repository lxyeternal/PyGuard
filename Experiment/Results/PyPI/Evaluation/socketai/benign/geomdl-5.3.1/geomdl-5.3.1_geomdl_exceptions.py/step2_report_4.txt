  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines a custom exception class `GeomdlException` inheriting from `Exception`.\n- Imports from a local utility module `_utilities`.\n- Uses a constant `ERROR_PREFIX` for error messages.\n- Constructor accepts a message and optional data, prefixes the message, and stores data.\n- No external input handling, network activity, code execution, or obfuscation.\n- No malicious code, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The class is straightforward, serving as a custom exception with optional data.\n\n### Logical or Reasoning Flaws:\n- No flaws or mistakes in the logic or reasoning are evident.\n- The use of a utility module `_utilities` is standard, though its content isn't provided. There is no indication that it introduces malicious behavior.\n- The exception handling pattern is typical and safe.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign `0`. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign very low (0 or 0.1). Given the code's nature, a risk score of 0.1 might be slightly cautious due to the import from a local utility module, but since there's no evidence of malicious or dangerous behavior, a score of 0.0 is justified.\n\n### Any discrepancies or unreasonable scores?\n- The scores seem consistent with the code's content. No report suggests a higher risk or malware score than 0.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The import from `_utilities` could be a point to review if further context suggests malicious intent, but on its own, it’s standard.\n- The exception class could potentially be instantiated with untrusted input for `msg` or `data`, but since the class only stores these and does not process or execute them, this is not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign nature. The reports are thorough and accurate in their assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of a custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
