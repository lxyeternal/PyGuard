{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for geometric errors, allowing error messages and optional data to be stored and retrieved.",
  "sources": "The constructor accepts a message and optional data; the import from the local '_utilities' module for export decorator.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks; only stores provided message and data.",
  "flows": "Input data (msg, data) flows into the exception instance; no external or network flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; standard exception class implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class with a message prefix and optional data storage. It imports a utility for export purposes, which is typical in modular code. There are no external data flows, unsafe operations, or dynamic code execution. The class does not process untrusted input beyond storing it, and no network or file system activity is present. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns indicate no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The import from '_utilities' is typical for modular code and does not pose an immediate threat. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero. The minimal concern regarding the import source suggests a risk score of approximately 0.1, but given the evidence, it remains very low.",
