  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the underlying code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**  \n   All reports uniformly conclude that the code is a straightforward custom exception class, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The code imports from a local utility module `_utilities`, but there's no indication that this import is malicious—it's a common pattern in modular codebases. The exception class simply prefixes error messages and optionally stores additional data, which is standard practice.\n\n2. **Code Logic and Data Flows:**  \n   The code does not process untrusted input beyond storing the message and data. It does not perform any unsafe operations, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks. The exception class is designed solely for error handling within a larger library.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Risks:**  \n   Since the class only stores provided messages and data, and does not execute or interpret them, there are no vulnerabilities stemming from this code snippet. The only minor point is the import from `_utilities`, which should be reviewed separately, but based on the provided information, it appears benign.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, as there is no malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - **Risk score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent, a low risk score of 0 or 0.1 is appropriate. The second report assigns 0.1, citing minimal concern over the import, but this is reasonable as a conservative estimate.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all conclude benign intent based on the code's simplicity.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency:**  \n   The scores across reports are consistent with the code's nature. The confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), which is appropriate given the straightforward analysis.\n\n**Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (a conservative, minimal concern for the import, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured custom exception class with no malicious or obfuscated content. The minimal security concern relates only to the import from `_utilities`, which warrants further review in the context of the larger codebase but does not pose an immediate risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo modifications to the scores are necessary. The code is safe, benign, and serves its purpose within the larger library.",
