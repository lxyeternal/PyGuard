  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code defines a simple custom exception class, `GeomdlException`.\n- It imports from a local module `_utilities`, likely for export decorators.\n- The class prepends a fixed error prefix to the message and optionally stores additional data.\n- No external data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code appears standard and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue-by-issue review:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Defines a custom exception class.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, straightforward code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defines a custom exception.\n- **Analysis:** Notes the import from `_utilities` and the potential for untrusted input, but finds no unsafe operations.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — this is slightly elevated, perhaps considering the import from a local module.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Justification for securityRisk=0.1:**  \nThe only potential concern is the import from `_utilities`. If this module were malicious or compromised, it could introduce risks. However, based solely on this code, there's no evidence of malicious behavior. The risk score seems slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Similar to previous, straightforward exception class.\n- **Analysis:** No unsafe operations, no external network, no code injection.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Similar observations.\n- **Analysis:** No external input handling or dangerous operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Again, a standard exception class.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is benign.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** The only slight concern is the import from `_utilities`, which could be a vector if the module were malicious, but there's no evidence here.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — considering the import from a local utility module, which could theoretically be compromised, but there's no direct evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\n- The reports are consistent with the code.\n- The scores are reasonable, though a slightly higher security risk could be justified if `_utilities` is untrusted, but without further context, 0.1 is acceptable.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign custom exception class with minimal security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the information.\n\n**Recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to import source)",
