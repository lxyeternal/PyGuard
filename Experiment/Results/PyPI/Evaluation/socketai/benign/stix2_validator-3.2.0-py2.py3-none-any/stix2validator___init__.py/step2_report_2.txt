  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, errors, or signs of malicious activity.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward import and namespace setup for a Python package.\n- No reports mention dynamic code execution, user input handling, network operations, or data processing.\n- The code snippets are typical for `__init__.py` files, exposing internal functions/classes for external use.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The comments about `# flake8: noqa` are standard for suppressing style warnings and are not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's content:\n- The code only performs import statements from internal modules and exposes them in the package namespace.\n- No signs of code that could process untrusted data, execute external commands, or contain malicious payloads.\n- The code does not contain any dynamic execution, network calls, or data sinks.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears benign, serving as a package initializer or API interface. There are no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Reviewing scores and justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code's nature. No malicious behavior is detected or suggested.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Are any score adjustments needed?  \nNo. The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- Some reports mention suppression of linting (`# flake8: noqa`) — this is standard and not suspicious.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities based on assumptions are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, such as dynamic code execution or data leaks, are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThese scores align with the code's content and the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard module setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are consistent, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that the internal modules themselves do not contain malicious code, but based on this snippet and the reports, the package appears safe.",
