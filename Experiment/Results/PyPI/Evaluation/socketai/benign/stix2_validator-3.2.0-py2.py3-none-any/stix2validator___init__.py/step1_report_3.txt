{
  "purpose": "This code exposes specific functions and classes from a module to the namespace for validation purposes in the stix2validator package.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.errors, .output, .util, .validator, .version)",
  "sinks": "None of the imported elements are used in a way that can lead to data leaks or malicious actions within this snippet",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is observable within this snippet as it only consists of import statements and comments",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating suppression of flake8 linting; no suspicious or unusual code behavior; import of internal modules is standard",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs imports of specific functions and classes from local modules, exposes them for external use, and includes a comment about linting behavior. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, or network activities. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code structures are present. The code appears to be part of a module setup or interface definition without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import and export setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities.",
