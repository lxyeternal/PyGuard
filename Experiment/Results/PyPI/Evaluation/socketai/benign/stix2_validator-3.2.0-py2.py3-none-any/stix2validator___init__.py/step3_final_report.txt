  "purpose": "Expose internal functions, classes, and errors to the package namespace for external use.",
  "sources": "Internal module imports such as .errors, .output, .util, .validator, and .version",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing; no untrusted data handling or network activity",
  "flows": "Import statements bringing internal components into the package namespace",
  "anomalies": "None; standard import and namespace exposure pattern, no suspicious or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py or setup module that imports internal components and exposes them. It contains no dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or data processing. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The comments and import structure are typical for a Python package initializer. All signals indicate benign, standard code with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup script, serving solely to expose internal functions/classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and risk: 0 are appropriate and justified.",
