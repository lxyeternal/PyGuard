{
  "purpose": "This module exposes functions, classes, and errors related to validation and output for the stix2validator package, serving as an interface or API for validation operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal package modules (.errors, .output, .util, .validator, .version); no external or user input sources are directly used in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data, nor does it perform any data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports functions and classes without executing data flows or processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated logic, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The initial comment disables linting with 'noqa', which is common but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules and exposes specific functions and classes for external use. It appears to serve as a public API layer, with no data processing, user input, or network interactions present. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The use of relative imports suggests it's part of a larger package, and nothing suspicious or malicious is evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a straightforward module interface for the stix2validator package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks in this snippet. Overall, it appears safe and standard for a Python package component.",
