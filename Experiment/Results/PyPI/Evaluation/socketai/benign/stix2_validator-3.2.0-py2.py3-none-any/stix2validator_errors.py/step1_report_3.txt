{
  "purpose": "The code provides custom exception classes and utility functions for schema validation and error message formatting within a JSON schema validation context, specifically for handling STIX data.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from error objects, error messages, and potentially schema properties during validation and error handling.",
  "sinks": "The code formats and outputs error messages; no direct sinks for untrusted data execution or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Sources (error objects, schema attributes) influence error message formatting, which is then returned as output; no external data flows or system commands are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The only notable aspect is the extensive custom error message rewording, which is benign. The remove_u function manipulates string representations, but is straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple exception classes and a set of functions for processing validation errors. It extensively customizes error messages for clarity, especially from JSON schema validation errors, using regex substitutions. No system commands, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code relies solely on local error objects and string processing. It does not execute untrusted code, run system commands, or handle sensitive data like credentials. The rewording of error messages and the removal of unicode prefixes are benign string manipulations. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a benign utility module for error handling in JSON schema validation with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely focused on improving error readability and managing validation exceptions, with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
