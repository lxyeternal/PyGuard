  "purpose": "Utility classes and functions for handling and formatting validation error messages in JSON schema validation, especially for STIX data.",
  "sources": "Error objects with message, path, schema, and instance attributes; regex substitutions on error messages.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Error object attributes (message, path, schema) are processed and reformatted via regex substitutions for clarity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex for message rewording; potential ReDoS risk if error messages are maliciously crafted, but contextually safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes and functions for error message formatting, primarily manipulating strings and error object attributes. No network, file, or environment modifications are present. Regex substitutions are used solely for improving readability of error messages, which is a common pattern. The regex-based rewording could theoretically be exploited via ReDoS if error inputs are maliciously crafted, but given the context (error message formatting), this risk is minimal. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns are detected. The code is straightforward and intended as a utility module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard utility for error handling and message formatting within a JSON schema validation framework. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior, and the minimal regex risk is acceptable given its purpose.",
