{
  "purpose": "The code provides custom exception classes and utility functions for validating and error reporting in a JSON schema validation context, specifically for STIX data structures.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code processes error objects and strings derived from schema validation.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the 'remove_u' function which processes strings, and the 'pretty_error' function which formats error messages. No direct data leaks or malicious output appear to be generated.",
  "flows": "Input error objects are formatted into human-readable messages by 'pretty_error'. There are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code predominantly focuses on error formatting and exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, primarily for validation errors in JSON schema contexts, with detailed functions for error message formatting. The 'remove_u' function strips unicode prefixes, and 'pretty_error' customizes error messages based on schema validation errors, including regex-based rewording for clarity. There are no indications of malicious behaviors, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The code does not process or execute untrusted input beyond formatting error messages, and all operations are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for error handling and message formatting in a JSON schema validation framework. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be safe and solely focused on enhancing error readability.",
