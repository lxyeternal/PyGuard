      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured validation framework for STIX JSON objects. It relies on standard practices such as schema validation via local files and remote URLs. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage is evident. The primary risk is trusting external schema sources, which is common in such tools. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
