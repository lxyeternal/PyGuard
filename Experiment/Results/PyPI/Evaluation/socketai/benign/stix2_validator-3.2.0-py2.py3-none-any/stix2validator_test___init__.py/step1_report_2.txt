  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without actual code provided, the exact purpose cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from environment variables, file systems, network connections, or function parameters (details not provided due to missing code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network transmissions, file writes, or database operations where untrusted data could be exploited, but specifics are unavailable without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input, environment variables, or files to sinks like network or file system operations, but detailed flow analysis cannot be performed without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified due to lack of code content. Typically, anomalies would include hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious control flows, none of which are evident here.",
  "analysis": "Unable to analyze code because no code was provided. Normally, this would include identifying data input points, analyzing data flow to critical sinks, checking for suspicious patterns like hardcoded credentials or malicious network activity, and evaluating code structure for obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "No code provided for review, thus no malicious behavior or security issues can be confirmed. The overall risk assessment cannot be performed without actual code content.",
