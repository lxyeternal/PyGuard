  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscation and dynamic execution features that warrant caution, but no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. The scores are appropriate given the evidence, with the highest suspicion in reports indicating obfuscation and dynamic code patterns. Overall, the supply chain risk remains low to moderate, emphasizing the need for runtime monitoring."
