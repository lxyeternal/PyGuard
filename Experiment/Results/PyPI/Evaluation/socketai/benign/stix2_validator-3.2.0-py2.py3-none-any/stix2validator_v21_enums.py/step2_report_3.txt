  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a static configuration module with no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. It reads CSV files into static lists, with no untrusted data flows or external command execution.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is accurate. The code solely loads data from local CSV files and defines constants and mappings. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate, as no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified, as the code is static and safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns well with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static data, CSV file reads, and no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a static resource module for validation purposes, with no malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, static data loading, no external code execution, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is purely configuration and data loading, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The analysis is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Static data definitions, CSV file reads, no external code execution, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a static resource loader, safe and standard.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on static data and file reading, no untrusted data processing, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code only reads static CSV files into memory, with no runtime processing of untrusted data or code execution.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's static, data-only nature.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, justified given the static, safe resource loading.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware:** The code does not contain any malicious payloads, dynamic code execution, or network operations. It only loads data from local CSV files, which are presumably trusted assets.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation patterns are present. The code is straightforward, with clear static data definitions and simple file I/O functions.\n\n- **Risk:** The code poses no security risk. It is a static configuration module used for validation or reference purposes.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — no obfuscation patterns.\n\n- **Risk score:** **0** — static, read-only data loading with no external or dynamic processing.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a benign, static resource module for cybersecurity validation, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.",
