{
  "purpose": "Provides a comprehensive set of constants, mappings, and utility functions for validating and working with STIX 2.1 open vocabularies, object properties, relationships, and external registry data.",
  "sources": "File reading from CSV files in 'assets' directory for media types, character sets, protocols, and IPFIX entities.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or sent externally; no network or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "Data is read from CSV files and stored as static lists; no untrusted data flows to external systems or commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is mainly static data definitions and helper functions for resource initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration and utility module for validating and managing STIX vocabularies, object types, properties, relationships, and external registry data. It reads CSV files from the 'assets' directory once and caches their content, which is safe and standard practice. There are no dynamic code execution, network connections, or data leaks present. The lists of external registry entries, constants, and mappings are typical and non-malicious. No obfuscation or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a static resource and utility module with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate component intended to support STIX validation or processing tasks.",
