{
  "purpose": "The code provides extensive data structures and utility functions for handling STIX 2.1 open vocabularies, object properties, relationships, and external registry data, likely to support a cybersecurity data validation or processing library.",
  "sources": "The code reads CSV files for media types, character sets, protocols, and IPFIX entities from the 'assets' directory, using glob and open functions. These are data sources for media types, charsets, protocols, and IPFIX info elements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the code that process untrusted data in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities. No network, command execution, or data writing operations are evident.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows. The only data flows involve reading CSV files into static lists, which are stored as function attributes for reuse.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain any anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. All data structures are static, and functions perform straightforward file reading and list creation.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly defines numerous static data structures for cybersecurity vocabularies and object properties. It includes functions that lazily load external CSV files to generate lists for media types, charsets, protocols, and IPFIX info elements. These functions only perform file I/O operations to populate static lists, with no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external command invocations. The overall structure is consistent with configuration or data management for a security validation library. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code does not manipulate untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely static data definitions and utility functions for loading known registry data. It poses no malware or security risks. No evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation was found.",
