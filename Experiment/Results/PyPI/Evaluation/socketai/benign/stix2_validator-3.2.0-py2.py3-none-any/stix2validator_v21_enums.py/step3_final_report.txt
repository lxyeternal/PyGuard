{
  "purpose": "This code provides static definitions, mappings, and functions for loading external reference data (CSV files) related to STIX 2.1 vocabularies, object properties, relationships, and external registries. It is used for validation, reference, and configuration purposes in cybersecurity tools.",
  "sources": "File I/O operations reading CSV files from the 'assets' directory during first function call, caching the loaded data in function attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only reads local CSV files and stores data in memory. No external network, command execution, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Initialization functions load CSV data into in-memory lists; no runtime data flow from untrusted sources or external inputs occurs.",
  "anomalies": "None. The code performs straightforward static data loading with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static resource module for cybersecurity validation, involving no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks. It reads CSV files once, caches their content, and provides constants and mappings for use in validation processes. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. All functions are safe and intended for static data provisioning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and safe, serving as a reference data loader for STIX validation. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
