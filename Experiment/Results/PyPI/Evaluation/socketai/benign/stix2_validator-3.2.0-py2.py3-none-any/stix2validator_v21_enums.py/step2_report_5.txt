  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues identified are valid, consistent, and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:**  \nThe report states that the code is a static configuration module with no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. It only reads CSV files and defines constants, with no external data flows or dynamic code execution.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code is purely static data and helper functions.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** Malware score 0 is appropriate; risk score 0 is justified.  \n- **Justification for risk/malware scores:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation.  \n- **Additional notes:** No assumptions or suspicious claims; the conclusion is correct.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are reasonable.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:**  \nAgain, the report emphasizes that the code is static data for validation, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. It highlights safe file reading and static lists.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code is static and safe.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0 are justified.  \n- **Justification:** No dynamic code, no external communication, only data loading.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are appropriate.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:**  \nThe report describes the code as a static configuration module, reading CSV files for validation purposes, with no malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** No.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0 are justified.  \n- **Justification:** Only static data, no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are appropriate.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:**  \nThe report again states the code is static, with no malicious behavior, only reading CSV files into static lists, and no data flows or code execution.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** No.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0 are justified.  \n- **Justification:** The code is purely static data loading, safe practices.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are appropriate.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:**  \nThe report concludes the code is static, benign, with no malicious activity, only reading CSVs into memory, no untrusted data processing at runtime.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** No.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0 are justified.  \n- **Justification:** No dynamic code execution, no external communication, only static data.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are appropriate.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code presence of issues:** None.  \n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity or obfuscation is detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is straightforward static data.  \n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final System-Wide Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected or implied).  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation or hidden code).  \n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk from static data modules).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and justified in their scoring. The code is a static resource module for STIX validation, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**No adjustments needed.**",
