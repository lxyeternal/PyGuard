{
  "purpose": "This code provides open vocabularies, object property mappings, and utility functions related to media types, character sets, protocols, and other static data for use in cybersecurity or STIX data processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads CSV files from the 'assets' directory to generate lists of media types, character sets, protocols, and IPFIX entities.",
  "sinks": "The CSV files are read, and the data is stored in memory; there are no direct sinks that process untrusted input beyond reading static files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CSV files (sources) into in-memory lists (sinks) through parsing functions; no untrusted data is fed into these functions at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily consists of static data definitions and simple file parsing functions; no anomalies or suspicious code constructs are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script defines large datasets of cybersecurity vocabularies, object-property mappings, and utility functions for static data retrieval, using file I/O to load external CSV assets only once (via function attributes). There is no dynamic execution, user input processing, or network communication. The code is purely data-centric and configuration-oriented, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing on static data loading and vocabulary definitions for cybersecurity data validation or processing. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are identified.",
