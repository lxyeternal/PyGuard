  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, potential issues, or overestimations in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is static, reads CSV files for external data, with no dynamic code execution or network activity. No malicious patterns detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is purely configuration and utility functions for loading static data, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or data leaks.\n\n- **Malware & Risk Scores:** Both set to 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** No change needed. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static data loading, no external communication, no suspicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code only reads CSV files into in-memory lists, with no dynamic code execution or external data processing.\n\n- **Malware & Risk Scores:** Both 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate. No modifications necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is static, reads CSV files for data, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a configuration resource, with safe file reads and no suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Malware & Risk Scores:** Both 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid assessment. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing static data loading, no dynamic or insecure operations.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code only performs file I/O during initialization, with no external command execution or untrusted data processing.\n\n- **Malware & Risk Scores:** Both 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate. No adjustments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—static data, no external sinks, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code's purpose is static data definitions and file reading for validation, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n- **Malware & Risk Scores:** Both 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is static, configuration-focused, and only reads data from local CSV files.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n- **Scores given to each issue?**  \n  Since all reports assign malware=0 and risk=0, which are reasonable, no changes are necessary.\n\n- **Justification for high risk scores?**  \n  None. The code shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The malware score should be 0, as no malicious behaviors are present.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports base their conclusions on the static, read-only nature of the code.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a static resource module for STIX validation, involving no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no data leaks, and no malicious patterns. All data loading functions are safe, and the code's purpose is well-defined and benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. No changes are necessary. The code is safe and suitable for its intended purpose.",
