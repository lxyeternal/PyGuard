{
  "purpose": "The code primarily provides static data, such as open vocabularies, object types, property mappings, and external reference lists for STIX 2.1 validation and processing.",
  "sources": "File reading operations for media types, character sets, protocols, and IPFIX entities from CSV files in the 'assets' directory.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no data is written or transmitted from untrusted sources within the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CSV files into in-memory lists used for validation or reference, with no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extensive but consists solely of static data definitions and simple data loading functions. No suspicious code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are evident. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a static reference resource for STIX validation, loading predefined lists of media types, character sets, protocols, and related constants from CSV files in a structured manner. All data handling is read-only, with no dynamic code execution, network communication, or data manipulation involving external inputs. The functions are straightforward and designed for caching lists to avoid repeated file access. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module functions solely as a static data resource for validation and reference purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows. Its purpose is legitimate and aligns with typical validation tools.",
