{
  "purpose": "Provides extensive constants, mappings, and functions for handling STIX 2.1 open vocabularies, object properties, relationships, and external data sources used in cybersecurity data validation and processing.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV files from the 'assets' directory to populate media types, character sets, protocols, and IPFIX entities lists.",
  "sinks": "No execution of untrusted data; the code only reads files and defines static data structures.",
  "flows": "N/A – The code does not process runtime data flows or execute external code; it only loads static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code consists solely of static definitions, constants, and data-loading functions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a collection of static data structures, constant lists, and functions to load external CSV files for media types, charsets, protocols, and IPFIX data. It defines comprehensive mappings for STIX object properties, relationships, and vocabularies, intended for validation or processing of STIX data. No dynamic or executable code processes untrusted inputs or external data in a way that could be malicious. The file does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or command execution. The only external file access occurs in the media_types(), char_sets(), protocols(), and ipfix() functions, which load predefined CSV files from a local assets directory. These are safe, standard resource loading procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration and data-loading module for cybersecurity data validation purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It is well-structured, purely static, and only reads external CSV files for data population. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
