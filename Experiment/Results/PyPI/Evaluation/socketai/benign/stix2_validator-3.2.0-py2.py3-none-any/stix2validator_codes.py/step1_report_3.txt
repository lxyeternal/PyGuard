{
  "purpose": "Define exit status codes and determine the appropriate exit code based on validation results.",
  "sources": "The function get_code reads the 'results' parameter, which contains validation results, and accesses 'errors' and 'fatal' attributes within each 'file_result' and 'object_result'.",
  "sinks": "The code returns a status code based on the processed results; no external or untrusted data flows or side-effects are present.",
  "flows": "The function processes each 'file_result', checks for errors and fatal conditions, and combines these with bitwise OR into a status code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and adheres to standard validation status handling. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constant error codes, then iterates over a list of results. It checks each result's 'errors' and 'fatal' flags, updating a cumulative status using bitwise OR. The logic appears to be for reporting multiple validation issues simultaneously. There are no dynamic code executions, external data reads, or suspicious behaviors present. The code is procedural and clean, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for aggregating validation results into a combined status code. It is benign, with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
