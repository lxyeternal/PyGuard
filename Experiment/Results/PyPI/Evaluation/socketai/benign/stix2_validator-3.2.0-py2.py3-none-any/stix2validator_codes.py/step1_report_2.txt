{
  "purpose": "The code defines exit status codes and a function to determine the appropriate exit code based on validation results.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'results' parameter, which is expected to be a list of validation result objects containing 'object_results' and 'fatal' attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or output; the code only manipulates internal variables and returns a status code.",
  "flows": "The function iterates over 'results', checks conditions on 'object_results' and 'file_result' objects, and updates the 'status' variable accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, defining constants for exit codes and a function that combines these codes based on validation outcomes. It processes data passed as parameters without any external input sources or network interactions. The logic uses simple control structures and bitwise operations, which are standard for such purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for determining script exit status based on validation results. It does not contain malicious intent or security risks.",
