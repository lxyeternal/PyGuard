{
  "purpose": "Define exit status codes and determine the appropriate exit code based on validation results.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'results' parameter passed to 'get_code', specifically 'file_result.object_results' and 'file_result.fatal'.",
  "targets": "The function computes and returns a combined status code based on the validation results.",
  "flows": "Input 'results' are inspected to set status flags; error conditions set specific bits in the status code, which is then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated elements are present. The code performs straightforward validation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for various exit codes. The 'get_code' function iterates through validation results, checks for errors and fatal conditions, and uses bitwise OR to combine status flags accordingly. The logic is simple and clear, with no signs of malicious activity or suspicious behavior. It merely processes validation outcomes to produce an exit status.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for interpreting validation results into an exit status. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation appears safe, with no anomalies or malware indications.",
