  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines constants for various exit statuses.\n   - The `get_code` function iterates over validation results, checking for errors (`object_results.errors`) and fatal conditions (`file_result.fatal`).\n   - It combines these conditions into a status code using bitwise OR.\n   - The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscation, external dependencies, or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code appears correct and free of errors.\n   - The logic aligns with standard validation result handling.\n   - No anomalies, hidden behaviors, or obfuscation are detected.\n   - The reports uniformly agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard utility code.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`. Given the absence of any malicious behavior, code injection, or external communication, this is appropriate.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`. The code is clear and readable.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign `0`. No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores:**\n   - The scores seem consistent with the analysis. No report suggests any suspicious activity warranting higher scores.\n   - The confidence levels are high, reflecting agreement on benignity.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The code's purpose is utility-based, handling validation results, not processing external inputs or executing dynamic code.\n   - No signs of malicious intent, malware, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n6. **Final Assessment:**\n   - Based on the code and reports, the scores are appropriate.\n   - The overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at **0**.\n   - The confidence in benignity is high, consistent with the reports.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, straightforward utility with no security risks or malicious behavior. The reported scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
