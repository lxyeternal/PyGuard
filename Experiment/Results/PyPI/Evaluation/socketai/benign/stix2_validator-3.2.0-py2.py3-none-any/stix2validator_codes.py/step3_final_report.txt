{
  "purpose": "Defines exit status codes and a function to determine the combined exit code based on validation results, indicating success, errors, or fatal issues.",
  "sources": "The function get_code reads from the results list, accessing file_result.object_results and file_result.fatal properties.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, databases, or network; it only computes and returns a status code based on input data.",
  "flows": "Results are iterated; errors and fatal flags are checked and combined into a status code via bitwise OR operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for exit statuses and a function that processes validation results, checking for errors and fatal flags, and combines these into a status code. It is simple, with no external dependencies or malicious logic. The logic is correct and aligns with standard validation handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The code is benign utility code, with no signs of obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for processing validation results into an exit status. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified.",
