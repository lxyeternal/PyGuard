  "purpose": "Define exit status codes and determine the script's exit code based on validation results.",
  "sources": "Input data is the 'results' list passed to the get_code function, which contains validation outcomes for files.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a status code; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Results are inspected for errors and fatal conditions, and the status code is set accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and lacks obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for exit statuses, then inspects a list of results to set a combined status code based on errors and fatal conditions. It appears to be a standard validation utility with no external network activity, no file manipulations beyond data inspection, and no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility to generate exit status codes based on validation results. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely as an internal status indicator without external dependencies or malicious intent.",
