{
  "purpose": "Define exit status codes and determine script exit status based on validation results.",
  "sources": "Input data is from the 'results' parameter of the get_code function, specifically 'file_result.object_results'.",
  "sinks": "The function returns an integer status code based on the analysis; no data leaks or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "The function iterates over 'results', checks 'object_results' for errors and 'file_result' for fatal errors, then combines status codes accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward, with clear documentation and no hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for exit statuses and a function that assesses validation results. It uses standard control structures, simple boolean checks, and bitwise operations to combine status codes. There are no indications of data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be standard utility code for handling validation results.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a utility for setting exit statuses based on validation results. It does not contain malware or security risks, and there are no signs of malicious intent.",
