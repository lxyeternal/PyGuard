{
  "purpose": "This code assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, serving as package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment with no data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard version string assignment in Python, with no input/output, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code's simplicity and clarity support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard practice for versioning in Python packages. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
