  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - The original code snippet is exactly: `__version__ = \"3.2.0\"`.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or complex logic.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they all correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree on zero malware and zero security risk, raising scores above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The code is just a version string assignment, which is a common, harmless practice.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the code's benign nature.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and do not assume malicious intent; they correctly identify the code as standard.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a straightforward version string assignment, a common practice in Python packages. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese align with the reports' findings and reasoning.",
