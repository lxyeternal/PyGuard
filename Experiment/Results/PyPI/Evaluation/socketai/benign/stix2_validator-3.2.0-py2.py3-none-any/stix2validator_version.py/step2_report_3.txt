  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to the variable `__version__`. The original code snippet is:\n   ```python\n   __version__ = \"3.2.0\"\n   ```\n   This is a standard practice in Python packages for versioning metadata.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The reports uniformly indicate no input sources, no data flows, no output sinks, and no anomalies.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for package versioning.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity are detected.\n\n3. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes in Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the simplicity of the code.\n   - They correctly identify that this is standard metadata declaration with no security concerns.\n\n4. **Score Justifications:**\n   - **Confidence:** All reports have a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity.\n   - **Obfuscated:** All report scores are 0, which is correct.\n   - **Malware:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk:** All are 0, which is justified.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - The code snippet is extremely simple; there's no basis for any higher risk or malware scores.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious code are justified here, as the code is plainly visible and standard.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the simplicity of the code, the scores are appropriate. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Score |\n|-----------------|--------------|\n| Malware         | 0            |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            |\n| Security Risk   | 0            |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard version declaration, with no security concerns.",
