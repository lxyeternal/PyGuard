  "purpose": "Logging and output formatting utilities for validation results, errors, warnings, and user interface display.",
  "sources": "Standard library functions, global flags controlling verbosity and silent mode, input arguments for message content.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs to stdout and stderr via the logging module; no external data sources or untrusted input processing.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into formatting functions which then output to logs; no external data influence or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code present; straightforward utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of logging setup and multiple functions for displaying validation results, errors, warnings, and UI elements. It uses standard libraries and global flags to control output verbosity and silence. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling. The functions are typical for CLI utilities, with no network activity, code injection, or data leakage. The code is simple, clear, and purpose-driven, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for logging and display purposes, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are correctly assigned as 0 for malware, obfuscated, and overall security risk.",
