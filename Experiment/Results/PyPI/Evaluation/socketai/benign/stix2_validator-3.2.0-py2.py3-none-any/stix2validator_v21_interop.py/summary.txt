  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe validation routine for object references within a structured data bundle. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate; the malware score should remain 0, obfuscated 0, and securityRisk should be set to 0 for full accuracy. Overall, the code is secure, and the reports correctly reflect its benign nature."
