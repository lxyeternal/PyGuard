  "purpose": "Basic setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the __main__ entry point to invoke the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function could potentially write files or install dependencies, but no untrusted data is processed directly.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code simply calls setup() when executed as main.",
  "anomalies": "The script is minimal, contains only standard setup invocation, and lacks any suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard minimal setup script for Python packaging. It imports setuptools and executes setup() in the main block. There are no sources of untrusted input, no data flows, and no suspicious behaviors such as code injection or malicious network activity. It does not contain hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. It is typical boilerplate for Python packaging with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign and standard setup script with no signs of malware or security issues.",
