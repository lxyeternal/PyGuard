{
  "purpose": "This code is for setting up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function call which reads package configuration (though no arguments are provided here).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the setup function itself is safe and typically used for package distribution.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as the code contains only a basic setup invocation without data input or processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The code is minimal and standard for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and executes 'setup()' if run as the main module. It does not include any arguments or configuration that could be malicious. The code is standard boilerplate for Python packaging and does not perform any data processing or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
