  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and standard for packaging",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard minimal setup script for a Python package, importing setuptools and executing setup() if run as main. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs, no hardcoded credentials, and no unusual behaviors. The script performs only a basic package setup invocation without any additional logic or external data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
