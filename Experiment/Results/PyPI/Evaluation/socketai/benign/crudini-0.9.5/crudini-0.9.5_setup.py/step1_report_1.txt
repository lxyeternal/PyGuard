  "purpose": "This code is intended to set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function from setuptools, which may read configuration from setup.py or other inputs.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present that process untrusted data; setup() executes with predefined parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or system effects.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard, and does not contain any obfuscated or unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the standard 'setuptools' library and executes 'setup()' in the main block, which is typical for a setup script. There are no additional parameters or logic that could indicate malicious behavior. The script performs a common, safe operation for packaging Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging and contains no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
