{
  "purpose": "A minimal Python setup script intended for packaging a Python project, performing no malicious or suspicious actions.",
  "sources": "The script reads no external input, environment variables, or data sources; it simply imports setuptools and calls setup().",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only executes a benign setup() call with no data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard Python packaging script that imports setuptools and invokes setup() in the main block. It contains no arguments, no data handling, no network activity, and no suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with full confidence. The code's simplicity and adherence to common packaging practices confirm its safety. No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities exists.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. All assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
