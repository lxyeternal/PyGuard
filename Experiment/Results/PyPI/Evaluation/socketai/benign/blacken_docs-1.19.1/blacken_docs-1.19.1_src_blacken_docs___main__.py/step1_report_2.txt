{
  "purpose": "To execute the main function from the blacken_docs module when the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "The code imports the main function from the blacken_docs module and calls it in the __main__ block.",
  "sinks": "The main() function invocation is a sink where untrusted input could potentially lead to execution or other effects, depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "If the script is run directly, it imports blacken_docs.main and executes main(), passing control to that function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present in the provided code snippet; it appears to be a standard entry point structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__.annotations for forward reference support, then imports main from blacken_docs. When executed as a script, it raises SystemExit with the result of main(), effectively terminating the program after main() runs. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The actual security implications depend on blacken_docs.main, which is outside the scope of this snippet. The code itself appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python entry point script that delegates execution to blacken_docs.main. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this fragment; any concerns depend on the implementation of main().",
