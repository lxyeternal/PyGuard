  "purpose": "Entry point script that imports and executes the main function from the 'blacken_docs' module when run directly.",
  "sources": "Import of 'main' from 'blacken_docs'; execution triggered in '__main__' block.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function; potential for external behavior depending on 'blacken_docs.main()'.",
  "flows": "Script calls 'main()' when run as '__main__', passing control to external module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard CLI pattern, no obfuscation, no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, following a common pattern for Python CLI scripts. It imports 'main' from 'blacken_docs' and executes it under the '__main__' guard. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'blacken_docs.main()', which is outside this snippet. Given the simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns, the code is benign. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1), consistent with the code's nature. No further issues or vulnerabilities are evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python script serving as an entry point to execute an external module's main function. All reports correctly identify its simplicity and assign appropriate low security and malware scores. No anomalies or malicious intent are detected or suggested. The overall risk remains minimal, contingent on the trustworthiness of 'blacken_docs'.",
