  "purpose": "Defines API URL and lists of valid request types for a Waifu image API, segregating safe and NSFW categories.",
  "sources": "Constants for API URL and request validation lists.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded credentials (beyond benign URLs and lists), or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a fixed API endpoint URL and two lists of valid request types, separating safe (SFW) and NSFW categories. There are no functions, user inputs, or external data handling, reducing the risk of malicious activity. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present. The constants serve as configuration for an external API, which is typical in such scripts. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward configuration module specifying API endpoints and allowed request types. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected; the code is benign and intended for use in a larger application.",
