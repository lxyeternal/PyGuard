  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Defines license, API URL, and static lists. No dynamic code, no user input, no network requests, no obfuscation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is purely static configuration. No issues. The score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, with an emphasis on whitelists for request validation, including NSFW content.\n- **Potential concern:** The inclusion of NSFW requests could be sensitive, but not malicious. The report notes this explicitly.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** The securityRisk score is minimal, reflecting that the presence of NSFW content lists is not inherently risky. The reasoning is consistent. The score seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, static constants for API URL and request lists. No dynamic code or data handling.\n- **Notes:** No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign configuration data.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous reports, with focus on configuration constants.\n- **Notes:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same pattern—static constants for API URL and request types.\n- **Notes:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe code that is purely static configuration: constants, whitelists, API URL. No user input, no network requests, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All correctly identified as zero.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly elevated in report 2 (0.1) due to NSFW content, but this is not malicious, just content categorization.\n- **Reasonableness of Scores:** All scores align with the code's nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Should stay at 0 for all, except possibly a minimal 0.1 in report 2, which is justified.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0 (or 0.1 for report 2, justified by content categorization, not malicious intent)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code snippets.",
