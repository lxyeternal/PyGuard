{
  "purpose": "Defines static configuration data including license, API URL, and request type whitelists for SFW and NSFW content.",
  "sources": "Static constants for API URL and request type lists",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow; static data used as configuration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static data with explicit NSFW categories",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, containing license information, a fixed API URL, and predefined lists of request types for SFW and NSFW content. There are no functions, user inputs, network requests, or dynamic behaviors. The inclusion of NSFW categories is explicitly labeled and appears to serve as validation or filtering lists, not malicious code. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The malware score is appropriately zero, as no malicious activity is evident. The security risk score is minimal (0 or 0.1), justified by the content categorization but not indicative of a vulnerability. The code's benign nature is confirmed by all reports, and the scores are consistent with its static, configuration-only purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration module with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with appropriate scoring. No further action is necessary.",
