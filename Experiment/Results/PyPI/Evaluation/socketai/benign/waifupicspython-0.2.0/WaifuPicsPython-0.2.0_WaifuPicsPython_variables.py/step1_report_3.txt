  "purpose": "Define API endpoint URL and validate request types for a Waifu image API.",
  "sources": "String constants for API URL and lists of valid request types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials (beyond public URL), or hidden behaviors. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code specifies a static API URL and two lists of valid request types for SFW and NSFW categories. These are simple data structures with no functions, user input handling, or dynamic code execution. No input validation, network operations, or data manipulation is present, reducing the risk of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a larger application where these constants would be used for request validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment only contains static data definitions for API configuration and validation purposes. There is no malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security risk within this snippet.",
