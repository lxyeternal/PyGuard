  "purpose": "Define constants and lists for API URL and request types related to an image API service.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read at runtime; static data only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains license information, a fixed API URL, and two static lists of allowed request types, categorized as SFW and NSFW. No user input handling, network requests, or dynamic code execution is present. The lists appear to be predefined categories for API requests, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The code's simplicity and lack of dynamic operations suggest it is a configuration or constants module. There are no indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign constants/configuration snippet defining API endpoint and request categories. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected.",
