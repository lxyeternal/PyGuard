{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package that imports classes from local modules related to asynchronous and synchronous sessions, likely for handling some form of data or network interactions.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources or external data reading operations are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sink points such as data output, network calls, or execution of untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows within this snippet; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements and a license header, with no suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "This code only includes a license declaration and import statements for local modules ('async_session' and 'sync_session'). There are no data handling, external network operations, or executable logic that could be malicious. The imports suggest a modular design, but without access to the imported modules, no malicious intent can be inferred from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving only as an import interface for session-related classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious data flow, or security risks in this fragment.",
