  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, consisting solely of license headers and import statements.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious intent are identified.\n- The code snippets are minimal, and no external data flows, network operations, or data handling are present.\n- The imports are from local modules, indicating a modular package structure.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code only imports classes `WaifuAsync` and `WaifuSync` from local modules `.async_session` and `.sync_session`.\n- There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- The license is a standard MIT License, common in open-source projects.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk score:** all are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- Since the code only contains import statements, there is no basis for higher risk or malware scores.\n- The reports do not mention any suspicious behavior in the imported modules themselves; without access to `async_session` and `sync_session`, we cannot assess their security.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The assessments are consistent and reasonable.\n- The code appears entirely benign, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final notes:**\n- Without additional context or code from the imported modules, there is no evidence to suggest any security concern.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate; the code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.",
