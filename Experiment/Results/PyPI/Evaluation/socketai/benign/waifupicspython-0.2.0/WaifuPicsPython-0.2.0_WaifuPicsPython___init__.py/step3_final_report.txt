{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports session classes 'WaifuAsync' and 'WaifuSync' from local modules, likely for managing asynchronous and synchronous sessions within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports classes from local modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as no data processing or external interactions occur.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a license header and straightforward import statements; no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module with license information and import statements. It does not execute any logic, handle data, or perform network operations. The imports are from local modules, indicating modular design. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Given the lack of external data handling or executable logic, there are no vulnerabilities or malicious indicators. The code's purpose appears to be structural, facilitating access to session classes within a larger package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary; the code can be considered safe for use.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
