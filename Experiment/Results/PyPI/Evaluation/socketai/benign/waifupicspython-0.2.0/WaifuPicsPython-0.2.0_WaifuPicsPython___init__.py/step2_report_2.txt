  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code is purely composed of a license header and two import statements:\n     ```python\n     from .async_session import (\n         WaifuAsync,\n     )\n     from .sync_session import (\n         WaifuSync,\n     )\n     ```\n   - There are no data flows, no network operations, no execution logic, and no external data handling.\n   - The code appears to be part of a modular package, likely for session management related to some \"Waifu\" service or application.\n\n2. **Assessment of Maliciousness and Security Risks:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, external data processing, or code execution patterns are present.\n   - The license is a standard MIT License, common in open-source projects.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward import statements and no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign a risk score of 0, which is justified as there is no evidence of security issues.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume that because the code is only import statements and a license header, it cannot be malicious. This is a valid assumption; malicious code often involves data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code, none of which are present here.\n   - The only minor consideration is whether the imported classes (`WaifuAsync`, `WaifuSync`) could be malicious, but since this snippet only shows the import statements, and no execution or data handling occurs here, there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a standard module setup, serving as an interface to session classes.\n   - The uniformity of the reports and their conclusions seem appropriate and consistent with the code snippet.\n\n6. **My Final Assessment:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n   - **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThere are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk in this code fragment. The reports are accurate and reasonable based on the provided code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
