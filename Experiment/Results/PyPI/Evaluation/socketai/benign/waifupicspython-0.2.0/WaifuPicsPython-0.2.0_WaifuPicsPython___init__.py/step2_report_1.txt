  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the evidence, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a simple set of import statements with an MIT license header.\n- No external data, network activity, or executable logic is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger modular package, likely for session management related to \"Waifu\" classes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in the code:\n- The code is benign; no malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The imports are straightforward, and the license is standard.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly identify the lack of malicious activity.\n- They do not overstate the security implications; the conclusion that the code is benign is justified.\n- No logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n- These scores are appropriate given the evidence.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- The reports correctly assign 0 for malware and security risk, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The code is non-obfuscated, and no suspicious activity is observed.\n- Therefore, raising scores above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n### Malware score:\n- No malware is present; all reports agree on 0.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities:\n- The code is static and contains only import statements; no vulnerabilities are implied.\n- The reasoning that the code is safe is sound.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports.\n- The conclusions match the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the evidence, I concur with the reports' findings. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity in this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and justified.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- The code is safe, and the scores should remain at zero for malware and security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is benign, and the current scoring is appropriate.",
