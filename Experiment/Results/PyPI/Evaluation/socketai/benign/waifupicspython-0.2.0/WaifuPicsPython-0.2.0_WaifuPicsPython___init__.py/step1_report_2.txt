{
  "purpose": "The code imports two classes, WaifuAsync and WaifuSync, from local modules async_session and sync_session respectively, likely for providing asynchronous and synchronous session handling functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .async_session and .sync_session",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows identified within this code snippet; the imports suggest later usage, but no execution flow present here",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license notice and import statements for two classes from local modules. There is no executable logic, data processing, or external network activity. The imported classes are presumably part of a larger project; this fragment does not contain any malicious or security-compromising code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard import module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any operations, data handling, or network communication in this snippet.",
