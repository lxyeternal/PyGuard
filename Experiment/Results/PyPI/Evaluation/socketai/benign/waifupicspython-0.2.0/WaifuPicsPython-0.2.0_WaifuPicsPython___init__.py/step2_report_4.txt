  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of license headers and import statements from local modules.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard module import setup within a larger package.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:**  \n  The code does not contain any executable logic, data handling, or network operations. The import statements are straightforward and standard.  \n  **Confirmed:** No issues are present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic:**  \n  The reports do not identify any logical errors; they correctly interpret the code as benign.  \n  **Confirmed:** No errors or flaws.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of scores:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, indicating no security risk, which aligns with the analysis.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues justifies any risk score above 0.5.  \n- The code is purely structural, serving as an import module, with no data flow or external interaction.\n\n---\n\n### Potential assumptions and claims:\n\n- The reports correctly challenge any assumptions about malicious intent, as none are evident.\n- The analysis is consistent, and no suspicious behavior is inferred from the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the provided scores and conclusions. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted for this code snippet.",
