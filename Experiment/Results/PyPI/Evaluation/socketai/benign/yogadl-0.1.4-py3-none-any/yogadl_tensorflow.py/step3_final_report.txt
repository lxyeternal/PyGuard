  "purpose": "Utility functions for reading TensorFlow datasets in eager and graph modes, serializing datasets to LMDB, and creating datasets from a custom stream object.",
  "sources": "dataset.as_numpy_iterator(), tf.compat.v1.data.make_one_shot_iterator(), stream.iterator_fn, tf.compat.v1.data.get_output_shapes(), tf.compat.v1.data.get_output_types()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external network activity; data serialization to LMDB is local.",
  "flows": "Source functions feed data into serialization functions; dataset iteration flows into LMDB serialization.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of TODO comments about infinite loops; use of deprecated tf.compat.v1 APIs; no actual infinite loops or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code handles dataset iteration in both eager and graph modes, with standard TensorFlow APIs. The TODO comments indicate awareness of potential infinite loops but do not implement malicious behavior. Use of legacy APIs is noted but not suspicious. No network activity, credential handling, or obfuscation is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code. The low risk reflects potential resource exhaustion issues if datasets are repeated, but no security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate dataset utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscation scores correctly indicate benign code. Overall, the code is safe for use in production environments.",
