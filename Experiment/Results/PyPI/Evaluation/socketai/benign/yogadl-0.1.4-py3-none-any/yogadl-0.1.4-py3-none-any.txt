      "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation for dataset storage and access, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the use of pickle, which should be replaced with safer serialization methods if untrusted data is involved. Overall, the code is safe for controlled environments, with a low security risk."
