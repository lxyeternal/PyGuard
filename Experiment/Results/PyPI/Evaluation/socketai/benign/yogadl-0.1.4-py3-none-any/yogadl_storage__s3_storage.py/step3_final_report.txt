  "purpose": "Manage AWS S3 storage for datasets, including checking, uploading, and downloading cache files with timestamp validation.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters (access keys, bucket info), boto3 SDK methods (head_bucket, head_object, download_file, upload_file).",
  "sinks": "AWS S3 bucket and object metadata, local cache files.",
  "flows": "Credentials and configuration data flow into boto3 client creation; source functions check or retrieve object info; download/upload functions transfer files; metadata functions retrieve timestamps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network addresses. Error handling via assertions is standard but could be improved for robustness.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard AWS SDK calls for S3 interactions, with credentials passed as parameters, avoiding hardcoded secrets. Error handling is via exceptions and assertions, typical for such implementations. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The logic is straightforward, managing cache files and timestamps. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage are detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to network interactions inherent in cloud storage operations. The malware score is zero, obfuscation score is zero, and the risk score is low (~0.1), consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for AWS S3 dataset caching. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
