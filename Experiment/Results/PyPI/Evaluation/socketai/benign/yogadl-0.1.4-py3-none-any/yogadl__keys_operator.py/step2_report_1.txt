  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes data sharding/shuffling utilities, input data from 'keys' list, no external data sinks.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and typical for data processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. The risk score seems slightly high given the benign nature; perhaps 0.1 is more appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, standard data sharding/shuffling, no external sinks.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard numpy usage. The risk score of 0.2 might be slightly high; 0.1 seems more fitting.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, data sharding/shuffling, no external data leaks.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious code. The risk score of 0.2 could be lowered to 0.1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for data processing, no external data leaks.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity or obfuscation. The risk score of 0.2 might be slightly conservative; 0.1 is more appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar data utilities, no external sinks.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected. The risk score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports are 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly high at 0.2 in most reports; given the code's straightforward, utility nature, a risk score of **0.1** is more appropriate.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, given the utility purpose and lack of suspicious behavior)\n\n**Overall:** The code appears to be a legitimate, standard utility for data sharding and shuffling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
