{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and a class for sharding, shuffling, and iterating over a list of byte keys, likely for distributed data processing or machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'keys' list passed to functions and class constructor; data is also obtained via the 'read_val_from_key_fn' callback.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed within functions and yielded by the generator; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'keys' list through sharding and shuffling functions, into the generator which applies 'read_val_from_key_fn' on each key, then yields results.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses numpy's random seed for shuffling, which is standard; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected. All operations are typical for data sharding and shuffling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data sharding (sequential and non-sequential) based on input parameters, with input validation. The 'shuffle_keys' function uses numpy's RandomState with optional seed, allowing reproducible shuffles. The 'GeneratorFromKeys' class manages epoch-based shuffling, with validation ensuring proper configuration when shuffling after epochs. There are no network connections, system modifications, or hidden behaviors. All operations are related to data partitioning and iteration, consistent with legitimate use cases in distributed computing. No signs of malicious intent or suspicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for data sharding and shuffling, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious network activity. The logic is straightforward and appropriate for its purpose.",
