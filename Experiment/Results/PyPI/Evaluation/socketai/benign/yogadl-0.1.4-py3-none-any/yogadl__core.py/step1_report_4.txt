{
  "purpose": "Defines core interfaces and data streaming mechanisms for a data layer in machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Imports data from external modules (tensorflow, typing), reads method parameters, and potentially reads dataset IDs and configurations.",
  "sinks": "Creates streams for datasets, returns dataset references, and stores datasets in cache.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (dataset IDs, dataset versions, configuration options) flow into submit and fetch methods, which then produce DataRef objects and streams.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code uses abstract classes and interfaces, with no direct data handling or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an abstract framework for data streaming and storage in ML workflows. It defines data structures, streaming interfaces, and cache management without performing any data processing, network communication, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated behaviors. Usage of tensorflow is standard for ML pipelines. No anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard framework for data streaming and caching in ML applications, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
