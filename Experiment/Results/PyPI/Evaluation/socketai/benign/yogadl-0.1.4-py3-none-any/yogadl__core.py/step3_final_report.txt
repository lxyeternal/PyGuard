{
  "purpose": "Defines core interfaces for data streaming, referencing, and storage in a machine learning framework.",
  "sources": "Methods that create or return data streams or references, such as stream() in DataRef and submit()/fetch() in Storage.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; primarily interface definitions with no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines abstract classes and methods without actual data flow or execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of abstract base classes and type annotations for data streaming and storage, with no executable logic, data handling, or network operations. All reports agree on its benign, interface-only nature. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code's purpose is to serve as a framework contract, not to perform any data processing or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured set of interface definitions for a data pipeline framework, with no malicious or security concerns detected. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
