{
  "purpose": "Define core interfaces and classes for a data streaming framework, including data references, streams, and storage mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Import statements for abc, typing, and tensorflow; class constructors; methods like stream() and fetch() that access datasets.",
  "sinks": "Potentially in methods like submit() and fetch() in Storage, where dataset IDs and versions are used; stream() generates data streams.",
  "flows": "submit() stores datasets, fetch() retrieves DataRef objects, and stream() generates data streams from DataRef; no external untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; all methods seem to be standard API definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract base classes and data structures for data streaming and storage, with no implementation details. It uses standard Python and TensorFlow imports, and all methods are abstract, serving as interfaces. No user input or external untrusted data processing is apparent. The code lacks any network operations, file manipulations, or cryptic code that could suggest malicious intent. The comments and structure are typical for framework interface definitions, with no anomalies or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a set of API interfaces for data streaming and storage, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign framework component without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
