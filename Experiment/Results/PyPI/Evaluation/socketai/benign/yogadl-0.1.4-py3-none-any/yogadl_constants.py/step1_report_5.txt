  "purpose": "Define string constants for storage backends, specifically AWS and GCS storage identifiers.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static string assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data passing between sources and sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; only simple constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two string assignments for storage identifiers. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, no environment variable access, and no network activity. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, straightforward constant declarations for storage backend identifiers with no malicious intent or security risks.",
