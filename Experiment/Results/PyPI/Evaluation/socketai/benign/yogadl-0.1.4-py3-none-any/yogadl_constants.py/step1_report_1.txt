  "purpose": "Define constants for different storage backend identifiers.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; constants are hardcoded strings.",
  "targets": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; constants are used as identifiers within code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment of string constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior; only simple string assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two string constants defining storage types, with no dynamic code, external inputs, or sensitive data handling. There are no obfuscated parts, no code execution, and no network activity. It appears to be a standard configuration or constant definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward constant definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
