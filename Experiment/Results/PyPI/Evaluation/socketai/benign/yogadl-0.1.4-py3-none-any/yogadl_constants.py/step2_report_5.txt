  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the underlying code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe code is a simple declaration of two string constants:\n```python\nAWS_STORAGE = \"aws_storage\"\nGCS_STORAGE = \"gcs_storage\"\n```\nThere are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behavior. The code is static, straightforward, and appears to serve as configuration constants.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. It is a benign, minimal snippet defining constants.\n\n### Logical or Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Flaws in reports:** All reports correctly identify that the code is simple constant definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior. They do not overstate or assume vulnerabilities beyond what the code shows.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since there's no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the benign nature.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of any security concern.\n\n### Any discrepancies or unreasonable scores?\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable across all reports. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that are not evident in the code.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify that this code is harmless and purely declarative. No malicious or security issues are present or implied.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is safe, with no security concerns.",
