  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports describe the code as defining two string constants, `AWS_STORAGE` and `GCS_STORAGE`, used as identifiers for storage backends. The code is static, with no inputs, outputs, data processing, or dynamic behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, code execution, or network activity.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**  \nAll reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and only defines constants. No external inputs, no data flows, no code that could be exploited or used maliciously. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \nThe code appears correct for its purpose: defining constants. There are no logical errors or security flaws. The comments include licensing information, which is standard.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature. No malicious activity is indicated or implied.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since the code does not handle sensitive data, perform risky operations, or interact with external systems.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**  \nNo report makes unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities. They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is a standard, safe constant declaration with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent. No further action or adjustment is needed.",
