  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple constant definitions: two string variables indicating storage backends.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and appears to be configuration constants.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: two string constants, no external dependencies, no runtime logic.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the logic or reasoning of the reports.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since the code is only defining constants, there is no immediate security risk.\n- The reports do not mention any external dependencies, environment variables, or dynamic code that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n- The absence of any suspicious activity or obfuscation aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious behavior is evident.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified, as the code does not introduce any security concerns.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores or conclusions.\n- The code is benign, with no security issues or malicious intent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, static declaration of constants for storage backend identifiers. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
