  "purpose": "Define storage backend identifiers for AWS and GCS storage services.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments for AWS_STORAGE and GCS_STORAGE.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow to external or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data sources; simple assignment statements.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; only static string definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns string literals to variables representing storage options. There are no inputs, no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors. This appears to be configuration constants used elsewhere in the larger project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, defining constants for storage backends with no malicious intent or security risks. No anomalies or malicious activity detected.",
