  "purpose": "Define constants for storage backend identifiers used in configuration.",
  "sources": "No data inputs; static constant definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; constants are used internally.",
  "flows": "No data flow; constants are assigned static string values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with standard licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only two string constants, 'AWS_STORAGE' and 'GCS_STORAGE', with no dynamic behavior, inputs, outputs, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, simple configuration code. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code's purpose is clear and limited to defining constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static declaration of storage backend identifiers with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent; no adjustments are necessary.",
