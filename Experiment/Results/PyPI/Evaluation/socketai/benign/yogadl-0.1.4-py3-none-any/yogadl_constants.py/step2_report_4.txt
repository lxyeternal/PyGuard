  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content**: The code only contains two string constants defining storage backends:\n   ```python\n   AWS_STORAGE = \"aws_storage\"\n   GCS_STORAGE = \"gcs_storage\"\n   ```\n   There are no functions, input/output, dynamic code, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The code is straightforward, static, and contains no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - No data flows, external inputs, or sensitive data handling are present.\n   - The code appears to be a simple configuration snippet.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - The reasoning in each report is consistent: the code is just constant definitions with no security implications.\n\n4. **Scores**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty about benign nature, which is reasonable.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - Since the code is so minimal, there is little room for malicious activity.\n   - The reports do not identify any issues, which aligns with the code content.\n\n6. **My own assessment**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n   - **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**: All reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation**:\n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a simple, static declaration of constants for storage backends, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and analysis in all reports are appropriate and consistent.",
