  "purpose": "Define constants for different storage backend identifiers",
  "sources": "None (no input reading occurs in this code)",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data processing or output)",
  "flows": "None (no data flow, no source-to-sink paths present)",
  "anomalies": "Simple variable assignments, no anomalies or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code contains only two constant string definitions for storage options, with no input handling, data processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues. The code appears to be a standard configuration snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward declaration of string constants for storage options with no malicious intent or security concerns identified.",
