  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only defines two string constants (`AWS_STORAGE` and `GCS_STORAGE`) with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or external interactions.\n   - The code is static, straightforward, and contains no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code is benign; no issues are present.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n   - The constants are typical configuration identifiers used within larger codebases.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware: 0`\n     - `obfuscated: 0`\n     - `securityRisk: 0`\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are justified here, as the code is trivial.\n   - The reports correctly avoid overestimating risk or malware potential.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The assessments are consistent across reports.\n   - The conclusion that this code is benign and poses no security risk is justified.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is a standard, safe constant definition with no security concerns.",
