{
  "purpose": "This code appears to import various storage configuration and storage classes from local modules, likely for handling cloud storage interactions within a larger system.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules within the package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks; no network or file output operations are present",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from input sources to sinks; the code only imports classes and does not process data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present; the code is straightforward and appears to be part of a module setup",
  "analysis": "The code contains license comments and imports multiple classes related to cloud storage configurations and implementations from local modules. It is standard practice in Python packages to organize code in this manner. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are evident. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or secret handling. There are no anomalies or suspicious constructs, and the code’s structure is typical of a well-structured Python package component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import setup for a Python package dealing with cloud storage configurations. It contains no malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. The code is safe and does not pose a supply chain threat.",
