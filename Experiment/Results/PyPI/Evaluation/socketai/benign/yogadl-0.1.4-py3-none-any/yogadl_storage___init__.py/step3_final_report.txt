{
  "purpose": "This code provides import statements for various cloud storage configuration classes, serving as part of a larger cloud storage module setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_cloud_storage, _gcs_storage, _lfs_storage, _s3_storage)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; purely static import statements",
  "flows": "Import statements do not involve data flow; they simply load classes for use elsewhere",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and import statements for internal modules related to cloud storage configurations. There is no data processing, external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The structure is straightforward, and the code appears to be a standard module setup for a larger package. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a standard import setup for cloud storage modules. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concern. The current low scores are justified and should be maintained.",
