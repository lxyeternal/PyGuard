  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a package providing cloud storage configuration and storage classes, likely for cloud-based data handling in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (_cloud_storage, _gcs_storage, _lfs_storage, _s3_storage) which may contain further input or data handling, but no direct data reading in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet; no data is processed or transmitted here.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this snippet; it's primarily import statements establishing references to classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present in this snippet. The comments are standard license headers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical import module structure, importing specific classes from other local modules related to cloud storage configurations. No data input, network operations, or malicious behavior indicators are present. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as obfuscation or dynamic code execution, are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import setup for cloud storage components, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It serves as part of a larger, likely legitimate, cloud storage handling package.",
