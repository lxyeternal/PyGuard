  "purpose": "The code appears to import storage configuration classes from various modules, likely for cloud storage management.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (._cloud_storage, ._gcs_storage, ._lfs_storage, ._s3_storage). No external input reading is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; the code only imports classes and does not execute data flow or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code solely contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious patterns, or suspicious code structures observed. The code contains only comments and import statements, which are standard.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily composed of licensing comments and import statements for storage configuration classes. No data processing, external input handling, or potentially malicious behavior is present. The structure indicates typical module setup for a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of licensing comments and module import statements. There are no signs of malicious activity, suspicious behavior, or security risks within this fragment.",
