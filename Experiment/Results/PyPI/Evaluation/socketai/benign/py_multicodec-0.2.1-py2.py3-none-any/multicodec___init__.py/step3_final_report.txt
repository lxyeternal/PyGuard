{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer (__init__.py) that sets package metadata and imports functions from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__) and imports functions from the local module .multicodec.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code flows from setting metadata to importing functions; no data flows from external sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py for a Python package, containing only metadata and import statements. No dynamic execution, user input handling, network activity, or data processing is present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The import from a local module is standard for package setup. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's simplicity and static nature support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initializer with no malicious, obfuscated, or security issues. The reports are accurate and scores are justified. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
