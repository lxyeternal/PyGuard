  "purpose": "This is the top-level package initialization for 'py-multicodec', importing functions from a local module.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'multicodec' module and its functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points identified.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from sources to sinks due to lack of executable code or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only metadata, import statement, and module documentation; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely structural, defining package metadata and importing functions from a local module. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modification. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The import statement is standard for package structure. Overall, the code is straightforward and appears to be a standard package initialization script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely sets package metadata and imports functions from a local module, with no evident anomalies.",
