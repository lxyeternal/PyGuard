  "purpose": "Define package metadata and import functions from the multicodec module.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__) and the import statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or input points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only sets metadata and imports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be standard package initialization code.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata such as author, email, and version. It then imports specific functions from the local 'multicodec' module. There are no dynamic code executions, no hardcoded credentials beyond metadata, no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. It appears to be boilerplate for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security issues evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initializer with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply sets metadata and imports functions. No suspicious or malicious activity is present.",
