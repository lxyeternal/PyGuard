  "purpose": "Provides top-level package information and imports functions from a local module for multi-codec handling.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__) and the import statement for functions in .multicodec.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward package metadata and import statements without dynamic execution or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard package metadata definitions and a single import statement for functions from a local module. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or data exfiltration. The import is from a local relative module, which is common in Python packages. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only defines metadata and imports functions, with no suspicious or malicious content.",
