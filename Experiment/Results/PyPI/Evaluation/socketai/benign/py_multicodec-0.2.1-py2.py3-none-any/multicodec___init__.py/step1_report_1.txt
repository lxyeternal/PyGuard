{
  "purpose": "This is a top-level package initializer for 'py-multicodec', providing metadata and importing functions from the multicodec module.",
  "sources": "Metadata definitions (__author__, __email__, __version__), import statement for multicodec functions.",
  "targets": "None explicitly, as the code mainly defines metadata and imports functions; no untrusted data sources or sinks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process data at runtime, only imports functions from another module.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The import statement appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata and imports specific functions from a local module. There is no input/output processing, no data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The import is straightforward, and no obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present. The structure and content are typical for a Python package __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is standard in structure and functionality.",
