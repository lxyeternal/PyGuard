{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for handling multicodec data, including encoding, decoding, prefix management, and lookup operations for multicodec types and prefixes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters such as bytes_, multicodec (string), and constants from imported modules (NAME_TABLE, CODE_TABLE).",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe data flows include returning or manipulating unvalidated bytes data and prefix information, but no direct sink of untrusted input leading to security breaches is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through encoding/decoding functions (extract_prefix, get_prefix, add_prefix, remove_prefix) to output values; no external or network communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code performs standard encoding/decoding and table lookups.",
  "analysis": "The code handles multicodec data by encoding and decoding varint-prefixed data, using lookup tables for prefix management. It includes error handling for invalid inputs, such as ValueError on bad varint or unsupported multicodec names. No user input is processed directly; operations are based on provided parameters and constants. There is no evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. The use of varint encoding/decoding appears standard, and the functions are straightforward. No network operations, system calls, or data exfiltration methods are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard multicodec prefix handling with appropriate error handling and data processing. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities are detected. It appears safe and intentionally designed for its purpose.",
