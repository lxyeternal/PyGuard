  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is standard, with no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Uses standard varint encoding/decoding, lookup tables, and exception handling. No malicious activity or malicious data processing detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The high risk score seems unjustified given the code's straightforward utility nature. No security risks or malicious behaviors are evident. The score should be closer to 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code is utility-focused, with standard practices, no suspicious patterns, or malicious intent. No external network activity or dangerous data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The risk score is low, which aligns with the analysis. No change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard utility functions with proper validation, no anomalies, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscation or malware indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The risk score is appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports; straightforward, safe data handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate scores.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard, safe, and well-structured utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is purely utility for multicodec prefix management.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any report.\n- **Risk Score:** Except for Report 1, which overestimates the risk, all other reports correctly assign very low or zero risk.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should be **0** across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be **0** across all reports.\n- **Risk Score:** For Report 1, reduce from 0.9 to **0.1** or **0**, aligning with the actual analysis. The others are fine at 0.\n\n### Justification:\n\n- The code performs standard encoding/decoding operations with proper exception handling.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- No external network activity or data exfiltration.\n- The high risk score in Report 1 appears to be an overestimation.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.1    |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The only adjustment needed is to lower the risk score for Report 1.",
