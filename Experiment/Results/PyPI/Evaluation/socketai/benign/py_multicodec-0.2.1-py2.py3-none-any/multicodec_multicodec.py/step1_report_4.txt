  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling multicodec prefixed data, including adding, removing, and identifying prefixes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters: 'bytes_' for data bytes and 'multicodec' or 'name' for codec identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Returns data after processing, potentially for further use or storage. No direct sink of untrusted data leads to security impacts within this code.",
  "flows": "Input bytes are decoded or encoded with varint and combined or sliced based on prefix length; data flows from input parameters to output functions with internal processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Uses standard library 'varint' for encoding/decoding, and straightforward handling of data. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard techniques for handling multicodec data, including varint encoding/decoding, prefix addition/removal, and lookup tables. No external or untrusted data is used directly in dangerous operations, nor does it execute code based on input. The functions appear well-structured and serve a clear purpose without malicious intent. No anomalous behavior, suspicious data handling, or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides utility functions for multicodec data management with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include any backdoors, malicious data exfiltration, or unsafe operations. Overall, it appears safe and intended for data handling in a larger, safe context.",
