  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling multicodec prefixed data, including extracting, adding, removing prefixes, and codec lookup.",
  "sources": "Function inputs: bytes data, multicodec names; External constants: NAME_TABLE, CODE_TABLE",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data dangerously; primarily data transformations and lookups.",
  "flows": "Input bytes -> extract_prefix -> get_prefix -> add_prefix / remove_prefix -> get_codec",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, or unusual code behaviors detected. Usage of varint encoding/decoding is standard for such data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utilities for managing multicodec data, including encoding/decoding prefixes and validating codec names. It relies on external tables for mapping. The exception handling is standard, converting internal errors into ValueError. No operations suggest malicious intent or malicious data processing. No external network access or side-effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for managing multicodec data with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. It performs expected data handling and validation routines without any risky operations.",
