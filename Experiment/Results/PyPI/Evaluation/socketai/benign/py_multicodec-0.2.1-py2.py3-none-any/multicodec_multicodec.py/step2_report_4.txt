  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward utility for multicodec prefix management.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The functions rely on standard varint encoding/decoding and lookup tables, with proper exception handling.\n- No evidence of external network activity, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code appears correct and functional.\n   - The lookup tables (`NAME_TABLE`, `CODE_TABLE`) are external and presumed safe.\n   - Exception handling is standard.\n   - No suspicious or insecure patterns are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - No evident logical errors.\n   - The functions behave as intended.\n   - The only minor point is that `extract_prefix()` raises `ValueError` on `TypeError`, but `varint.decode_bytes()` typically raises `ValueError` on invalid input, so this is acceptable.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n   - Security risk scores are very low or zero, also consistent.\n   - Obfuscated scores are zero, matching the straightforward code.\n\n4. **Justification for high risk scores (>0.5):**\n   - None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are 0 or near-zero.\n   - The code is a utility module, not executing untrusted code or external commands.\n\n5. **Malware score:**\n   - Correctly assigned as 0 in all reports.\n   - No malicious activity is present.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with no unwarranted assumptions.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- They correctly identify that the code is a standard, safe utility for multicodec prefix management.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are present.\n- The use of lookup tables and varint encoding is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code's security depends on the integrity of `NAME_TABLE` and `CODE_TABLE`. If these tables are malicious or compromised, the impact could be significant, but this is outside the scope of the code itself.\n- As it stands, the code is a benign, well-structured utility.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and justified. The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Risk score: **0**",
