  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code against the claims, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a utility module for handling multicodec data, involving prefix extraction, addition, removal, and lookup functions.\n- It relies on external lookup tables: `NAME_TABLE` and `CODE_TABLE`.\n- Uses standard `varint` encoding/decoding.\n- No external network or dynamic code execution is present.\n- Exception handling appears conventional.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The functions perform straightforward data transformations.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** The code is legitimate, standard, with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no evident vulnerabilities.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Utility functions with no dangerous data handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, possibly due to the fact that the functions could be misused if inputs are malicious, but no actual vulnerabilities are identified.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is sound. The slight security risk score reflects the potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Standard utility functions, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Utility functions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Standard multicodec prefix handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall evaluation:\n- **Code presence:** The code is present and functions as described.\n- **Malware potential:** None observed. The code performs data handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** Absent.\n- **Risk scores:** Appropriately low, given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned by all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are justified.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at **0** for malware and obfuscated, and **0** or very close to 0 for security risk, considering the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or negligible, e.g., 0.1 for potential misuse, but not a vulnerability)\n\nThis code appears to be a safe, standard utility module for multicodec prefix management with no security concerns.",
