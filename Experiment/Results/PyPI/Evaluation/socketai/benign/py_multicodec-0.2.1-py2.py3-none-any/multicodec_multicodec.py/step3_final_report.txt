  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing multicodec prefix encoding, decoding, and lookup operations.",
  "sources": "Input bytes for prefix extraction, multicodec name for prefix retrieval, data bytes for prefix addition, prefixed data bytes for removal, prefixed data bytes for codec identification.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data flows from external input to prefix extraction, lookup, or data concatenation functions.",
  "flows": "Input data -> extract_prefix() -> decode varint -> get_prefix() -> encode prefix -> add_prefix() -> concatenate bytes -> remove_prefix() -> extract prefix -> get codec from table.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. Exception handling is standard. Lookup tables are external and presumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward encoding and decoding of multicodec prefixes using standard varint operations and lookup tables. It includes proper exception handling and no network or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The functions are utility in nature, with clear data transformations. The high risk score in the initial report (0.9) is an overestimation; the code is benign. All other signals align with a safe, standard implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility module for multicodec prefix management with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The high security risk score in the initial report should be lowered to reflect the benign nature. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
