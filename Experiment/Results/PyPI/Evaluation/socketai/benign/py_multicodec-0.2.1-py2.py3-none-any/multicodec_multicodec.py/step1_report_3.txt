{
  "purpose": "The code manages multicodec data by encoding, decoding, prefixing, and removing prefixes based on a lookup table, facilitating data identification and processing.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from function parameters (bytes_, multicodec, name), and reading multicodec names from external input (parameters).",
  "sinks": "Uses varint encoding/decoding functions that process data, and formats strings in error messages. No direct data leaks or insecure outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through encoding/decoding functions; multicodec name lookup maps to prefixes; prefixes are added or removed from byte sequences.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors identified. Usage of lookup tables and varint operations appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for managing multicodec prefixed data. It performs encoding, decoding, prefix addition/removal, and validation using predefined tables. Error handling is straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Use of external lookup tables (NAME_TABLE, CODE_TABLE) is common practice for codec management. No anomalous code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The functions operate on data and metadata without executing external or unsafe code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for managing multicodec data with proper validation and error handling. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. It is safe for use.",
