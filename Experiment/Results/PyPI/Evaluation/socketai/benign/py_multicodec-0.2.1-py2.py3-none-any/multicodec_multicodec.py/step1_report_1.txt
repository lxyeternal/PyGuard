{
  "purpose": "This code manages multicodec data by adding, removing, and identifying prefixes in byte sequences, facilitating encoding and decoding of multicodec formats.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'bytes_' (bytes), 'multicodec' (string), and 'name' (string) are sourced from function inputs, typically provided by external callers.",
  "sinks": "The code returns processed bytes (e.g., prefixed data, unprefixed data) and string identifiers based on lookup tables; no direct untrusted data sinks are present, but outputs could be misused if data is maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through encoding/decoding functions, utilizing lookup tables for prefix management, then outputs processed bytes or codec identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are observed. Use of 'varint' is standard, and lookup tables are presumed to be safe. Exception handling is conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code relies on standard varint encoding/decoding, uses lookup tables 'NAME_TABLE' and 'CODE_TABLE' for prefix management, and handles exceptions properly. No dynamic code execution or external network activity is present. The functions perform encoding, decoding, prefix management, and validation operations typical of data processing modules. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing multicodec data with safe and standard practices. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this module.",
