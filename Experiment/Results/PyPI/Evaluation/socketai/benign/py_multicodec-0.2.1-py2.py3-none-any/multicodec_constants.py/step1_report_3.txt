{
  "purpose": "Definition of codec mappings including prefixes and names for various serialization, multiformat, multihash, multiaddr, ipld, namespace, key, and holochain identifiers.",
  "sources": "Static dictionaries CODECS, NAME_TABLE, and CODE_TABLE initialized with predefined data; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present; no processing of untrusted data or external I/O occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows, input processing, or dynamic execution pathways; data is statically assigned within dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of static data definitions with no dynamic or executable logic; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static configuration mapping codecs to their prefixes and names, used for identification or serialization purposes. There are no functions, input handling, or runtime behaviors. The initial comments indicate auto-generation, and the data appears well-structured with no signs of malicious or suspicious patterns. The data is static and likely meant for lookups within other parts of a larger system. No indicators of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static mapping configuration with no malicious intent, no dynamic behaviors, and no security risks identified. It appears to serve as a reference or lookup table for various codec identifiers, with no evidence of supply chain attacks or malicious code.",
