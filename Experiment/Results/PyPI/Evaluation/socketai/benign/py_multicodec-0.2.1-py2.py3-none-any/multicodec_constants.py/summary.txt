  "conclusion": "The code is a static, auto-generated configuration mapping for protocol and hash identifiers. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and shows no signs of obfuscation. The assessments in the critical reports are accurate and consistent with the code content. Therefore, the overall security risk is negligible, with malware and obfuscated scores set to 0, and the confidence in this conclusion is 1."
