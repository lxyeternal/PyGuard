{
  "purpose": "This code defines a static mapping of codec names to their respective prefixes and vice versa, used for encoding, decoding, or identification of various data formats, multiformats, IP addresses, hash functions, and other protocol identifiers.",
  "sources": "The code reads the static data structures 'CODECS', 'NAME_TABLE', and 'CODE_TABLE' which contain predefined mappings; no external input or data sources are read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform data output, network operations, file I/O, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only creates and inverts static dictionaries based on predefined constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a generated warning comment indicating it is auto-generated and should not be edited manually. No hardcoded secrets, user input processing, or dynamic code execution are present. The data appears to be static mappings for well-known protocols and hashes.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines immutable mappings between string identifiers and their associated prefix values, and creates two dictionaries for easy lookup in both directions. There are no functions, no data processing, no runtime data input, and no external dependencies. It appears to be a configuration or reference module. No suspicious patterns, such as dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious data handling, are detected. The comment at the top suggests the file is generated automatically, which reduces suspicion of malicious intent or tampering.\n\nGiven the absence of data input, output, network activity, or code execution, the code functions solely as a static lookup table with inverse mappings.\n\nThe only minor anomaly is the initial comment indicating it is generated, which is typical for configuration files and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, generated mapping of protocol, hash, and data format identifiers to their prefixes, used for protocol identification or serialization. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are detected. It is a standard configuration data module with no security concerns.",
