  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as static, auto-generated mappings between names and prefix values for codecs, hashes, protocols, etc.\n- No dynamic code, no input/output, no network activity, no functions.\n- The data appears comprehensive but static, consistent with configuration files.\n- The initial comment indicates auto-generation, which is standard and reduces suspicion.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; static data for serialization, hashing, etc.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; no malicious behavior, just static data.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Confidence: 0.95 — justified given the thorough analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct; static mappings.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; static configuration with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Risk: 0 — correct.\n  - Confidence: 1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; static, benign data.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Confidence: 1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; static data, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Confidence: 0.9 — acceptable, slightly less than perfect, but justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; static, configuration data.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Confidence: 1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence:** No, all reports correctly identify that this is static data.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent:** None detected. The extensive list of cryptographic and protocol constants is typical for such libraries.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the data is static and well-known.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign appropriate scores—zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk, high confidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert estimate:**\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the assessments provided. The code is a static, auto-generated configuration table with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence in benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis code is a benign static mapping used for protocol and hash identification. The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. No further action or concern is warranted.",
