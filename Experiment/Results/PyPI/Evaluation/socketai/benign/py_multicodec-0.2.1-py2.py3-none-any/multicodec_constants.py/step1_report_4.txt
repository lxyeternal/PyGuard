{
  "purpose": "Defines dictionaries mapping encoding or protocol names to their corresponding prefix byte sequences for serialization, multiformat, multihash, multiaddr, ipld, namespace, key, and holochain protocols.",
  "sources": "Data sources are the static dictionaries CODECS, NAME_TABLE, and CODE_TABLE, which contain predefined mappings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted external input are present; the code only initializes static mappings.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks is observed; the mappings are static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates the file is generated, suggesting it is meant to be auto-produced. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The content is purely data definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static data mapping setup for various encoding protocols and protocols used in decentralized and distributed systems. It appears to be auto-generated (as indicated by comments), with no input handling, no data processing, and no network or system interaction. The data is extensive but standard and aligns with protocol specifications. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic is found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated mapping configuration for protocol prefixes. It contains no malware or security risks. Its purpose is likely for use in a larger project to translate protocol names to their respective byte prefixes and vice versa.",
