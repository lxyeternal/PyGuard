{
  "purpose": "This code defines a dictionary of codec names mapped to their corresponding prefix values, and creates lookup tables for name-to-prefix and prefix-to-name conversions. Its purpose appears to be to facilitate encoding and decoding of multiformats or multihash data structures.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from the CODECS dictionary, which is hardcoded within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink functions or data handling operations where untrusted input is processed. No external data or user input is involved.",
  "flows": "Since the data is static, there are no dynamic flows from sources to sinks; the mappings are straightforward and static.",
  "anomalies": "The initial comments indicate the file is auto-generated, which could suggest automated processes, but this is standard for configuration or static mapping files. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed.",
  "analysis": "The script only creates static mappings for various codecs and hash functions with their associated prefixes. The code is purely declarative with no functions, network operations, or data processing. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The extensive list of codecs and their prefixes suggests this is a utility module for encoding/decoding, not an attack vector. No dynamic execution, external data handling, or sensitive data exposure occurs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, well-structured mapping configuration for codecs and multihash identifiers. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose appears to be standard in nature, likely part of a larger cryptography or data serialization library. No signs of supply chain attacks or sabotage are evident.",
