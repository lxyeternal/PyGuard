  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the actual code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a static, auto-generated mapping of protocol, hash, and data format identifiers to their respective prefixes and names.\n- It consists solely of data definitions: dictionaries `CODECS`, `NAME_TABLE`, and `CODE_TABLE`.\n- No functions, no dynamic code, no I/O, no network activity.\n- The initial comment explicitly states it is generated automatically.\n- The data includes well-known cryptographic hash prefixes, protocol identifiers, and multiformat constants, all standard in such libraries.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Consistency:\n\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  No. The code is purely static data, with no dynamic or executable components that could be malicious or flawed.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  The reports correctly identify the code as static configuration data, with no suspicious behavior or dynamic processing. They note the extensive list of constants but do not suggest any malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores given to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the static nature of the code.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  No. All reports give a risk score of 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Since the code is static data, and no code execution or dynamic behavior is present, malware score should be 0. All reports agree.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the static, generated nature of the data.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis. No anomalies are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- The reports are thorough and accurate. They recognize the code as a static, auto-generated configuration mapping with no malicious intent.\n- The extensive list of hash and protocol identifiers is standard and not suspicious.\n- No obfuscation or hidden logic is present.\n- The comments and structure indicate a typical, well-structured configuration file.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk, as it's static data)\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\n- The data itself, being static and well-known, does not pose a security threat.\n- The only potential concern could be if the data were maliciously altered, but as provided, it appears correct and standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0              |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, static mapping table used for protocol and hash identification. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The reports' assessments are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Working through this step-by-step confirms that the code is safe and standard for its purpose.**",
