{
  "purpose": "Static mapping of protocol, hash, and data format identifiers to their respective prefixes and names, used for serialization, multiformat, multihash, network protocols, IPLD, namespaces, keys, and holochain identifiers.",
  "sources": "Predefined static dictionaries within the code, including CODECS, NAME_TABLE, and CODE_TABLE.",
  "sinks": "No external input or data flow; only internal static data used for lookups.",
  "flows": "Lookup tables created from static data; no dynamic data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward and auto-generated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a large, static, auto-generated dictionary defining protocol and hash prefixes, with no functions, dynamic code, or external dependencies. It contains well-known constants aligned with standard protocol specifications. The comments indicate auto-generation, which suggests it is intended as a configuration resource. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior are present. The lookup tables are simple mappings derived from the static data. Given the absence of executable logic, external data handling, or suspicious patterns, the code is benign and intended for reference or configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, auto-generated configuration mapping for protocol and hash identifiers. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and shows no signs of obfuscation. The assessments in the critical reports are accurate and consistent with the code content. Therefore, the overall security risk is negligible, with malware and obfuscated scores set to 0, and the confidence in this conclusion is 1.",
