  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the actual code content.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a large static dictionary (`CODECS`) defining mappings between protocol/format names and their associated prefix bytes.\n- It also constructs two lookup tables (`NAME_TABLE` and `CODE_TABLE`) for bidirectional mapping.\n- The file includes a comment indicating it is auto-generated.\n- There are no functions, no dynamic code, no input/output operations, and no external dependencies.\n- The data is static, well-structured, and aligns with known protocol and hash function standards.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Consistency\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **No.** All reports correctly identify that the code is static data, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  **No.** Each report appropriately concludes that the code is benign, static, and intended for lookups.\n\n- **Scores given to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk as 0, which is consistent with the code content.\n\n- **Justification for high risk scores (>0.5):**  \n  None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are 0, which is justified given the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n- **Malware score reflection:**  \n  All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; malware scores are 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  All reports avoid assumptions, sticking to facts about static data and auto-generation comments.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n  Scores are consistent; no issues flagged as risky or malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of each report:\n\n- **Report 1:**  \n  - Accurately describes the purpose and nature of the code.  \n  - Correctly notes the extensive list of constants, but finds no malicious intent.  \n  - Confidence at 0.95 is appropriate.\n\n- **Report 2:**  \n  - Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the static, generated nature.  \n  - Appropriately assigns perfect confidence and zero malware/security risk.\n\n- **Report 3:**  \n  - Also aligns well with the code's static nature.  \n  - Reiterates that no dynamic or malicious behavior is present.\n\n- **Report 4:**  \n  - Correctly identifies the purpose as static mappings for protocols and formats.  \n  - No issues with its assessment.\n\n- **Report 5:**  \n  - Similar conclusions, emphasizing the data's static, configuration-like nature.  \n  - Appropriately assigns a high confidence score.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports correctly assign **0**, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign **0**, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All are **0**, consistent with the static, benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a static, auto-generated mapping table with no executable logic, no external data handling, and no signs of malicious intent. It is typical for configuration or protocol reference files.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. No modifications are necessary. The code poses no security risk, malware, or obfuscation concerns based on the provided content.",
