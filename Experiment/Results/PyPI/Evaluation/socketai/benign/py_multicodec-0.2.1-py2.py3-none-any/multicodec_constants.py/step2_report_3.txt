  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the provided code and the nature of the data.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a static, auto-generated mapping of protocol, hash, and data format identifiers to their prefixes.\n- No dynamic code, functions, or data processing are present.\n- The data appears to be standard, comprehensive, and aligned with known protocol specifications.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious data handling.\n- The initial comments explicitly state the file is generated, which is typical for configuration data.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes static mappings.\n- **Security & Anomalies:** No dynamic behavior, no external input, no code execution, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, with a high confidence level (0.95). No malware or security risk.\n\n**Score adjustments:** No change needed. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies static data structures.\n- **Security & Anomalies:** No dynamic code, no external input, no output.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, with full confidence (1). No malware or security issues.\n\n**Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes static data.\n- **Security & Anomalies:** No dynamic behavior or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, high confidence (1). No malware detected.\n\n**Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Security & Anomalies:** No dynamic or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, with high confidence (0.9). No malware or security concerns.\n\n**Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Security & Anomalies:** No dynamic behavior, no external data handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, full confidence (1). No malware or security risks.\n\n**Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (score 0). The code is purely static data.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the static, well-structured nature, and the absence of dynamic or malicious code, the overall security risk should be **very low**, close to 0.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, static data)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk in static configuration)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification**\n\nThe code is a static, auto-generated mapping table for protocol and hash prefixes. It does not perform any operations that could be exploited, nor does it contain any malicious or obfuscated code. The extensive list of constants aligns with standard protocol specifications, and the comments explicitly state it is generated, reducing suspicion. Therefore, the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and I concur with their assessments.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score |\n|------------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                     |\n| Security Risk    | 0                     |\n\nThis code segment is benign and purely informational.",
