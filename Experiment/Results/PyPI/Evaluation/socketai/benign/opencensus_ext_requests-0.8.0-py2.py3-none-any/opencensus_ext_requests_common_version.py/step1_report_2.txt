  "purpose": "The code appears to set metadata for a Python package, including license information, version, and licensing details.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as there are no input/output operations or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Contains licensing and versioning comments; no suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily documentation and metadata declarations, including license comments and a version assignment. There are no active code logic, input handling, or security-sensitive operations. The licensing comments do not pose security risks. The version string is a standard string assignment. Overall, the code is straightforward and standard for open-source package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata and licensing information with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
