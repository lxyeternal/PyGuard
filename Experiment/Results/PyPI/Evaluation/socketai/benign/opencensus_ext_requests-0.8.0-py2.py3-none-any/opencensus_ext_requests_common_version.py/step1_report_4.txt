  "sinks": "There are no sink functions or operations that process untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs, as the code contains only comments and a version variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the content is standard license and version information.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a license header and version variable assignment, which are typical in open-source modules. No code executes any operations, reads input, or interacts with external data sources. It does not contain any obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or embedded malicious behavior. The structure and content are straightforward and consistent with standard open-source project files.",
