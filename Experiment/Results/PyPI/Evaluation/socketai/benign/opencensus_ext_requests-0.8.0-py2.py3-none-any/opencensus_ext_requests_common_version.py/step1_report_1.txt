  "flows": "No data flow paths identified; code consists solely of comments and a version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code contains only licensing comments and a version string assignment with no unusual or suspicious content.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely composed of licensing comments and a single assignment setting a version string. There are no executable code blocks, no data input, no data processing, and no external interactions. It does not contain any dynamic code, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. This is typical for header or metadata sections of a software package. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard licensing header and version declaration, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for open-source projects.",
