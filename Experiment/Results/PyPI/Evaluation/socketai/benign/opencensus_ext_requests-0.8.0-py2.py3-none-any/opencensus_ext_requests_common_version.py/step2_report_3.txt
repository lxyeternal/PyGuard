  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code consists solely of licensing comments and a single assignment: `__version__ = '0.8.0'`.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data processing, dynamic code, or external interactions.\n   - The code is typical for a header or metadata section of an open-source Python package.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No obfuscated code, embedded scripts, or dynamic execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or external dependencies.\n   - The licensing comments are standard and do not introduce security risks.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, purely metadata, and contains no malicious behavior.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), and the analysis correctly identifies the code as safe.\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the content.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Correctly 0; no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0; code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Correctly 0; no security risks are present in this snippet.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Misinterpretations:**\n   - No issues are present in the code or the reports.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their benign assessment.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since this is just a metadata snippet, it cannot contain malware or vulnerabilities.\n   - The only potential concern could be if this code was part of a larger, malicious package, but based solely on this fragment, there is no indication of that.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard open-source header with versioning and licensing comments. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The reports are accurate and consistent with the actual content.",
