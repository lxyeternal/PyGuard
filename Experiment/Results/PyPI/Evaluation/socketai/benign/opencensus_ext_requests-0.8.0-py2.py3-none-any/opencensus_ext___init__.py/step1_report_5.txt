{
  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package resources using pkgutil.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and calls 'extend_path' with __path__ and __name__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; the code only modifies __path__.",
  "flows": "The code modifies the __path__ variable by extending it with additional package locations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a common pattern for package namespace extension; no unusual or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses 'extend_path' to modify the __path__ variable, which is typically used in namespace packages to include additional directories. This pattern is standard in Python packages that support namespace extensions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The code is minimal and appears legitimate for package resource management.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard namespace package extension pattern with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
