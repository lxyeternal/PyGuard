  "sources": "Dynamic import of 'pkgutil' and calling extend_path with __path__ and __name__.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to __path__, which influences package namespace resolution.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> call extend_path with __path__ and __name__ -> assign result to __path__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with a string literal; no obfuscation or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard namespace package extension by dynamically importing 'pkgutil' and calling extend_path with __path__ and __name__, then assigning the result back to __path__. This pattern is common in Python packaging for supporting namespace packages. No external data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code is straightforward, using standard library functions, with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent. The use of __import__ with a string literal is typical in such patterns and does not indicate obfuscation or malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
