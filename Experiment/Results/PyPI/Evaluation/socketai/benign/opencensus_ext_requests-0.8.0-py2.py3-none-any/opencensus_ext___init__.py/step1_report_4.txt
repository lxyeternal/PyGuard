{
  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ for namespace package support using pkgutil.",
  "sources": "Access to __import__('pkgutil') and __path__, __name__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Imports 'pkgutil' to extend __path__, affecting how the package is loaded but not involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with string literal is standard; no unusual or obfuscated code detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module dynamically using __import__ and calls extend_path to modify the __path__ variable, enabling namespace package functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. The code is concise and employs common Python idioms for package extension.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for namespace package support and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign, common practice in Python packaging.",
