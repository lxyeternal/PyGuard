  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import (__import__) to load 'pkgutil', which is a standard library module, and extension of __path__, which is typical for namespace packages. No malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module using __import__, then calls its extend_path function to modify the __path__ variable for namespace package support. Both 'pkgutil' and extend_path are standard Python features, and their usage here is consistent with standard practices for namespace packages. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. No malicious or security issues are evident.",
