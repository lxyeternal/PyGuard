  "purpose": "Extend the module's __path__ for package namespace support",
  "sources": "__import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with a string literal is standard; no suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and calls 'extend_path' to modify the __path__ variable for package namespace extension. This pattern is common in namespace packages to support multiple directories. No user input or external data is involved, and there are no indications of malicious intent or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard operation for namespace package support without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
