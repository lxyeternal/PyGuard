  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard tracing wrapper with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The observed signals confirm benign behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the potential for header misuse but not actual malicious activity."
