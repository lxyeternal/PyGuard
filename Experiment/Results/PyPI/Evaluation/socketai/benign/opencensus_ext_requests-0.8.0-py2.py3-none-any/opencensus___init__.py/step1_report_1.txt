{
  "purpose": "Extend the current package's __path__ for module discovery, facilitating namespace package support.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ and __name__ variables, and imports 'pkgutil' to extend the package path.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process user input or external data.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'pkgutil' to extending the __path__ using extend_path, which modifies the package's search path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. The code performs a standard namespace package operation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and calls extend_path with __path__ and __name__, which is a common pattern to support namespace packages in Python. This code is straightforward and does not include any obfuscated or malicious constructs. It neither reads untrusted input nor writes data externally. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for supporting namespace packages and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
