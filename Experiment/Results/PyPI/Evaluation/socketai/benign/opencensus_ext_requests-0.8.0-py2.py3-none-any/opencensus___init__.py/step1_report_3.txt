  "purpose": "Extend the current package's __path__ for namespace package support.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses extend_path to modify __path__.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "The code imports a standard library module and modifies __path__, with no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; usage of extend_path is standard for namespace packages and does not involve secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' to call extend_path on __path__ with __name__ as arguments. This is a common pattern to support namespace packages, allowing multiple directories to contribute to a package namespace. No user input, external data, or dynamic execution is involved. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed. The code is concise and follows standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet implements standard namespace package extension and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
