  "purpose": "Extend the current package's __path__ attribute for module discovery and package extension.",
  "sources": "Reads the __path__ and __name__ variables, and imports 'pkgutil' to extend the module's package path.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends __path__ using extend_path(__path__, __name__), which is a standard pattern for package extension.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code performs a typical package initialization step.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and calls extend_path with the current __path__ and __name__, a common technique for supporting namespace packages. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or obfuscation. The code does not read external input or write to external resources. It is a standard package setup operation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization pattern to support namespace packages. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
