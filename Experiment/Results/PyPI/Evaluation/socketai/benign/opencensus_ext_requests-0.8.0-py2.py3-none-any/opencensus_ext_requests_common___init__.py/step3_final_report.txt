{
  "purpose": "Extend the __path__ for namespace package support using pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' dynamically via __import__ and uses extend_path to modify __path__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code performs a standard namespace extension.",
  "flows": "The dynamic import (__import__('pkgutil')) leads to the call to extend_path with __path__ and __name__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ instead of static import; minimal obfuscation potential; no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a common pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. It dynamically imports 'pkgutil' which could be used for obfuscation but is standard in such patterns. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious actions are present. The use of __import__ introduces a slight dynamic aspect but is justified and typical in namespace package support. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.1, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace package extension pattern with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify this, and the scoring is justified. No modifications are necessary.",
