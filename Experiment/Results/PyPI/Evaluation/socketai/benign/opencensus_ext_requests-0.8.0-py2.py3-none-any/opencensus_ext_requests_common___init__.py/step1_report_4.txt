  "purpose": "Extend the package search path for namespace packages.",
  "sources": "__import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data leakage or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code modifies __path__ for package extension.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import and extension of __path__ could be suspicious in certain contexts, but is a known pattern for namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module and extends the __path__ variable, which is a standard approach for handling namespace packages in Python. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection. The code appears to be a legitimate package setup technique, although it is minimal. No suspicious activity or obfuscation is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation for namespace package support and does not exhibit malicious intent. It is unlikely to pose security risks.",
