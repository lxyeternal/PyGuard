  "sources": "__import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Imports 'pkgutil', calls 'extend_path' with __path__ and __name__, updates __path__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior; the code performs a standard package path extension.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module and extends the __path__ variable, which is typical for namespace packages to include additional paths for module discovery. There are no hardcoded secrets, no data leaks, no network operations, or obfuscated code. The operation is a common pattern in Python namespace packages. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace package pattern with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
