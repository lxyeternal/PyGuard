  "purpose": "Extend the current package's __path__ for namespace package support.",
  "sources": "__import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A – standard namespace extension, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import and extend_path method appears normal; no suspicious or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses its extend_path function to modify the __path__ variable, which is a common pattern for namespace packages in Python. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. No external inputs or untrusted data are processed. The code appears standard and consistent with Python's namespace package practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet performs a typical namespace package extension without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
