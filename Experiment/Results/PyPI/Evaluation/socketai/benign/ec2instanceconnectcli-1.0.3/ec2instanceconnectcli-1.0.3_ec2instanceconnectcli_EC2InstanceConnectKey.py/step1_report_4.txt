  "purpose": "Generate a 2048-bit RSA SSH key pair, save the private key to a temporary file, and provide access to the public key and private key file path.",
  "sources": "key_utils.generate_key(), key_utils.serialize_key(), tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(), open()",
  "sinks": "Writing private key to temp file, changing file permissions, deleting temp file in destructor",
  "flows": "generate_key() -> serialize_key() -> write private key to temp file -> access via get_priv_key_file() -> delete in __del__",
  "anomalies": "None observed; the code properly manages temp file creation and deletion, with appropriate permissions set for private key",
  "analysis": "The code securely generates an RSA key pair, writes the private key to a temp file with permissions 600, and provides access to both public key and private key file path. It properly deletes the temp file on object destruction. Usage of standard libraries and clear separation of concerns suggest no malicious intent. No suspicious data flows or hardcoded secrets are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code securely handles RSA key generation and storage without any suspicious behavior or malicious code. It properly manages temporary files and key permissions, indicating safe, intended functionality.",
