  "purpose": "Generate a 2048-bit RSA SSH key pair, store the private key securely in a temporary file with permissions 600, and clean up the private key file upon object deletion.",
  "sources": "key_utils.generate_key(), key_utils.serialize_key() for key generation and serialization; open() for writing private key; tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() for temporary file creation.",
  "sinks": "Writing private key to disk; setting file permissions to 600; deleting temporary private key file during object destruction.",
  "flows": "generate_key() -> serialize_key() -> write private key to temp file -> set permissions -> delete file on __del__",
  "anomalies": "Minor implementation detail: opening the temporary file with open() instead of using the tempfile object directly; reliance on __del__ for cleanup, which may be delayed or skipped in some environments.",
  "analysis": "The code securely generates RSA keys, serializes them, writes the private key to a temporary file with strict permissions, and deletes the file upon object destruction. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The minor implementation detail regarding file handling does not impact security but could be improved for robustness. The reliance on __del__ for cleanup is generally acceptable but not ideal; explicit cleanup methods could be preferable. Overall, the code aligns with cryptographic best practices and does not exhibit malicious or insecure behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs secure RSA key generation and management with proper permission setting and cleanup. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to temporary private key storage, which is standard practice. The malware score is zero, and the obfuscated score is zero, with a low security risk score of 0.2 justified by the temporary storage of sensitive data.",
