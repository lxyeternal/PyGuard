{
  "purpose": "Generate a 2048-bit RSA SSH key pair, write the private key to a temporary file, and provide access to the public key and private key file path.",
  "sources": "key_utils.generate_key(), key_utils.serialize_key() for private and public key generation and serialization",
  "sinks": "Writing the private key to a temporary file in _write_priv_key(), changing file permissions, deleting the temp file in __del__",
  "flows": "Key generation via key_utils, private key written to temp file, private key file path returned, temp file deleted upon object destruction",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no network activity or data leaks observed",
  "analysis": "The code securely generates an RSA key pair, writes the private key to a temp file with proper permissions (600), and cleans up the file upon object deletion. The public key is provided as a string. Usage of 'key_utils' suggests reliance on external trusted functions for key operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The temp file handling and permission setting are appropriate, and the code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as intended to securely generate and manage SSH keys without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks. No obfuscation or malicious signals are present.",
