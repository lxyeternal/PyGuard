{
  "purpose": "Generate a 2048-bit RSA SSH key pair, write the private key to a temporary file, and provide access to public and private key files for use with EC2 Instance Connect CLI.",
  "sources": "key_utils.generate_key(), key_utils.serialize_key()",
  "sinks": "Writing private key to a temporary file, changing file permissions, deleting temporary file",
  "flows": "generate_key -> serialize_key (private key) -> write to temp file -> return file path",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no suspicious external network activity, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code generates an RSA key pair using utility functions, serializes the public and private keys, writes the private key to a securely permissioned temporary file, and ensures cleanup upon object deletion. It manages sensitive private key data properly by setting restrictive permissions and deleting the temporary file afterward. No external network calls, no code injection, no suspicious data handling detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform legitimate cryptographic key generation for SSH access, with appropriate handling of private keys and cleanup. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this module.",
