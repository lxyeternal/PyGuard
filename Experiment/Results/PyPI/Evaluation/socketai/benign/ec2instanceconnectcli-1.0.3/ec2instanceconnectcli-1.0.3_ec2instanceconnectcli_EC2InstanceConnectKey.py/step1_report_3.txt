{
  "purpose": "The code generates a 2048-bit RSA SSH key pair, writes the private key to a temporary file, and provides methods to retrieve the public key and private key file path.",
  "sources": "Key generation via key_utils.generate_key; reading and writing private key to temporary file; environment variables are not directly used.",
  "sinks": "Writing private key to a file; changing file permissions to 600; deleting the temporary file in destructor.",
  "flows": "Key is generated, serialized, and written to a temporary file; the private key file path is provided; upon object deletion, the file is removed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets; standard use of temp files; no suspicious code or backdoors detected. The code writes sensitive data to disk with proper permissions.",
  "analysis": "The code securely generates an RSA key pair, stores the private key temporarily with restrictive permissions, and cleans up the file upon object deletion. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of tempfile and os.chmod indicates standard security practices. The only notable aspect is that private keys are stored temporarily on disk, but this aligns with intended functionality and proper cleanup is implemented.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for SSH key management, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It securely handles private keys and cleans up resources appropriately.",
