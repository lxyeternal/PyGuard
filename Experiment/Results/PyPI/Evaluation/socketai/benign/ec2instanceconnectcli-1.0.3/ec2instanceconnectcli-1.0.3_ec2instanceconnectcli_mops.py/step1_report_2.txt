{
  "purpose": "This script provides a CLI interface for connecting to EC2 instances via SSH or SFTP, managing keys and commands for remote access.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments (via argparse), particularly user-provided parameters such as region, zone, profile, instance ID, and commands.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include execution of remote commands via the EC2InstanceConnectCLI class, generation and handling of private keys, and logging actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from command-line inputs (sources) through parsing, key generation, and CLI command invocation, eventually leading to remote connection commands or key handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Use of third-party libraries appears appropriate; no obfuscated or unusual code patterns. Exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code parses command-line arguments for SSH/SFTP connection parameters, sets up logging, generates temporary SSH keys via EC2InstanceConnectKey, and then uses EC2InstanceConnectCLI to initiate remote commands. There is no evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malicious network activity. All functions rely on external, presumably secure modules for key handling and connection management. Exception handling is straightforward, and no suspicious code flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate EC2 connection utility without malicious intent. It manages keys securely and performs expected connection setup without suspicious behavior. No malware or malicious payloads are evident. The overall security risk is minimal.",
