  "purpose": "CLI utility for establishing SSH or SFTP connections to AWS EC2 instances, managing keys and invoking connection commands.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments parsed via argparse, external modules for key management and connection execution",
  "sinks": "External modules (`EC2InstanceConnectCLI`, `EC2InstanceConnectKey`, etc.) that handle key files and connection commands",
  "flows": "Input arguments → key generation and parsing → connection invocation via external classes",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper for AWS EC2 SSH/SFTP connections. It parses user inputs, manages temporary keys, and delegates connection tasks to external modules. No malicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. Exception handling is standard, and the logic aligns with typical connection utilities. External modules are not provided, but their usage appears legitimate. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated content. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on external modules, which are presumed secure. The scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
