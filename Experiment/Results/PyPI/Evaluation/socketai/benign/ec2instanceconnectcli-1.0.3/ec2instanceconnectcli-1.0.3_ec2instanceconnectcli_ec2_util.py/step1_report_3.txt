  "purpose": "Retrieve EC2 instance details such as DNS names, IP addresses, and availability zone using AWS Botocore session.",
  "sources": "session.create_client('ec2') call, response['Reservations'][0]['Instances'][0] data",
  "sinks": "Potential print statements for errors and sys.exit calls, which terminate the program",
  "flows": "session.create_client('ec2') -> describe_instances API call -> response parsing -> output via Namespace object or error handling",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling without logging specifics; no hardcoded secrets; error handling simply prints and exits; no suspicious network activity or code injection present",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an EC2 client using a provided session, calls describe_instances with a given instance ID, and extracts key instance details such as DNS names, IP addresses, and availability zone. Exception handling is broad but straightforward, primarily for API or data access errors. The code prints errors and exits on failure, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated logic are present. It performs expected cloud API interactions without suspicious behavior or data leaks. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for fetching EC2 instance metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard AWS EC2 data retrieval function with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It handles errors gracefully and performs expected operations. No malware or suspicious activity detected.",
