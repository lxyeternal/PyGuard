{
  "purpose": "Retrieve EC2 instance metadata including DNS names, IP addresses, and availability zone using AWS SDK (Botocore).",
  "sources": "session.create_client('ec2') to create an EC2 client, client.describe_instances() to fetch instance data, and response dictionary for data extraction.",
  "sinks": "None of the untrusted data flows are used in security-sensitive sinks such as system commands, file writes, or network calls beyond the AWS SDK, which is a trusted library.",
  "flows": "Session creates a client -> describe_instances API call -> response data parsed into namespace object.",
  "anomalies": "The code has multiple try-except blocks that silently handle exceptions, which could mask underlying issues, but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script fetches AWS EC2 metadata via the Botocore SDK, handling exceptions silently for missing data fields, and outputs the data encapsulated in a Namespace object. The use of AWS SDK functions is standard and does not involve untrusted input beyond the instance_id parameter, which is assumed to be controlled by the user. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code does not perform any dangerous operations, such as executing system commands or network communication outside the AWS SDK, nor does it contain obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for retrieving EC2 instance information via AWS SDK with proper exception handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. It appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious component of an AWS-based system.",
