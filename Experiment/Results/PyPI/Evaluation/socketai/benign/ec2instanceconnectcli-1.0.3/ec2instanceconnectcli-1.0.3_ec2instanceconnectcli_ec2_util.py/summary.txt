  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for retrieving EC2 instance metadata. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior is present. The current security scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to exception handling practices rather than security vulnerabilities."
