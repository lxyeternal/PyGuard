{
  "purpose": "Retrieve EC2 instance metadata such as DNS names, IP addresses, and availability zone using a Botocore session.",
  "sources": "Session.create_client('ec2') and response data from describe_instances API call",
  "sinks": "Potentially prints errors to standard output and exits the program; no data sinks or network transmission of data are present",
  "flows": "Session creation and API call lead to extraction of instance details; data stored in Namespace object; no untrusted data flows outside local context",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling (except:), multiple try-except blocks for optional fields, and direct sys.exit() calls on error; no malicious code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an EC2 client via a provided session, then requests instance details. It handles missing fields with exception blocks, and terminates on errors with sys.exit(). No user input, external data, or untrusted data is processed or transmitted outside the context. The code primarily interacts with AWS SDK and outputs errors or information locally. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection, is evident. Exception handling is broad but typical for AWS SDK errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for fetching and returning EC2 instance metadata. No malicious or suspicious activity is identified. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security risks beyond typical exception handling practices.",
