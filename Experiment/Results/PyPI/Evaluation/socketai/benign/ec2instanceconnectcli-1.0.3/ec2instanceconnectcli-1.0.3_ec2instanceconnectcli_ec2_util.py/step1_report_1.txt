{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves EC2 instance metadata such as DNS names, IP addresses, and availability zone using AWS SDK (Botocore).",
  "sources": "session.create_client('ec2') call and the 'describe_instances' API response, which involves instance_id input and AWS API response data.",
  "sinks": "Printing error messages to stdout and sys.exit() calls on errors, potentially exposing internal error details. No data sinks that leak untrusted data externally are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'instance_id' flows into the AWS describe_instances API request, and the response data flows into local variables and ultimately into an argparse.Namespace object.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains broad exception handling with 'except:' which may suppress useful debugging info, but does not show malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script securely uses the AWS SDK to query EC2 instance data based on a provided instance ID. Exception handling covers possible API errors, and the data retrieved is stored in a Namespace object. No external data exfiltration, malicious commands, or backdoors are present. Error messages are printed but do not leak sensitive data; however, printing exceptions could potentially reveal some internal details but not malicious. Overall, the code performs a legitimate API call with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for retrieving EC2 instance metadata. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It mainly handles API responses and errors appropriately, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
