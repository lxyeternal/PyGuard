  "purpose": "Retrieve EC2 instance network and availability zone information using the AWS SDK.",
  "sources": "session.create_client('ec2'), client.describe_instances, response['Reservations'][0]['Instances'][0] fields",
  "sinks": "print statements (error messages), sys.exit() calls",
  "flows": "API call to describe_instances -> parse response fields -> handle exceptions and output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious behavior; error handling is straightforward; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code securely calls AWS EC2 API via a session object, retrieves specific instance details, and handles errors gracefully. It uses try-except blocks to catch exceptions from the API call and response parsing. Error messages are printed, and sys.exit() is used for error states. No data leaks, network transmissions of sensitive data, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code does not perform any suspicious activities such as data exfiltration or malicious system modifications. It functions solely as an informational utility with standard error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate utility for fetching EC2 instance metadata without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
