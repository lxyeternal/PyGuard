  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports describe the code as standard cryptographic utility functions for RSA key generation, serialization, and format conversion. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code relies on well-established cryptography library functions and includes appropriate assertions and input validation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code performs standard cryptographic operations with no suspicious behaviors. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent. The confidence levels are high, reflecting a thorough understanding.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the code's nature as a utility library. Slightly above zero in some reports due to potential misuse if misapplied, but no inherent vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**  \nNone of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is appropriate. The code is a standard cryptographic utility, and risks would primarily arise from improper use rather than the code itself.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nScores are consistent with the detailed analysis—no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk scores reflect the utility nature of the code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, sticking to the facts that the code performs standard cryptographic functions with no suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final System Evaluation\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Security Risk Score:** 0.1 (accounting for potential misuse but not inherent risk)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a legitimate cryptographic utility for RSA key management, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The risk is minimal and primarily related to potential misuse rather than the code itself.\n\n**Recommendation:** No further action needed; the code is safe and standard for cryptographic operations.",
