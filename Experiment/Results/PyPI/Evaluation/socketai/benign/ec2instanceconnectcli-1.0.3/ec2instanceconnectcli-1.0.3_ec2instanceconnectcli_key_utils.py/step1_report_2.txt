{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for generating, serializing, and converting RSA keys in various formats using the cryptography library.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters such as 'bit_strength', 'key', 'encoding', 'password', 'der_key', and 'pem_key'.",
  "sinks": "Output data includes serialized key bytes in various formats; no direct sinks to external systems or networks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from key generation or conversion functions through serialization and format conversion functions, transforming key objects and byte sequences between DER, PEM, and OpenSSH formats.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code strictly performs cryptographic key operations without external communication or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard cryptography library functions to generate and convert RSA keys, with appropriate handling for encoding formats and key types. It includes assertions to prevent invalid serialization (e.g., private keys in OpenSSH format). No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage was identified. The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for cryptographic key management. It does not include any network communication, data exfiltration, or obfuscated constructs. No anomalous or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cryptographic utility for RSA key management, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe based on the provided code snippet.",
