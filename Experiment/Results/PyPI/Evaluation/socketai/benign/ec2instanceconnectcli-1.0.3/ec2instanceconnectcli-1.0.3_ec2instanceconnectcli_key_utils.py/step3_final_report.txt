  "purpose": "Cryptographic utility functions for RSA key generation, serialization, and format conversion using the cryptography library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for key size, encoding formats, and PEM/DER key bytes; internal function calls for key serialization and conversion.",
  "sinks": "Return of serialized key bytes; no external network or data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> key generation/serialization functions -> output key bytes; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code is straightforward and uses standard cryptography library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard RSA key generation and serialization tasks with proper validation and assertions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or network activity is present. The functions handle private and public keys securely, and the code is well-structured. The reports correctly identify the code as legitimate cryptographic utility code, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, with minimal security risk scores (around 0.1) due to potential misuse, which is acceptable given the context. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the clarity and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard cryptographic utility for RSA key management with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments across reports are consistent and justified. No modifications or further scrutiny are necessary.",
