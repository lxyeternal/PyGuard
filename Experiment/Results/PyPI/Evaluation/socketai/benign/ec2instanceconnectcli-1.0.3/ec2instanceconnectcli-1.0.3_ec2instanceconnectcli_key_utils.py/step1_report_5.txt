{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for generating, serializing, and converting RSA cryptographic keys in various formats.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters such as bit_strength, encoding, password, PEM or DER key data input for conversion functions.",
  "sinks": "Returns serialized key bytes in different formats; no direct data leaks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., key data, encoding options) are processed to produce key bytes; no external data flow or untrusted data handling beyond serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Code appears to be standard cryptographic utility functions. No code obfuscation or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard cryptography library functions to generate RSA keys, serialize them into various formats, and convert between DER and PEM. It includes input validation (e.g., assertions for encoding types and private key serialization). No external network calls, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior detected. The functions are typical for cryptographic key management with appropriate safeguards. The code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cryptographic utility module for RSA key management. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. No security risks are evident beyond standard cryptography best practices.",
