  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions for RSA key generation, serialization, and format conversion.\n- It uses the cryptography library properly, with standard practices.\n- No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- The functions handle private and public keys securely, with appropriate assertions.\n- The code appears legitimate and standard for cryptographic key management.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes standard cryptographic utility functions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or anomalies. The report correctly identifies the code as standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The high confidence and zero malware score are justified. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar to above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) is acceptable due to the potential misuse of key material if mishandled, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- Same observations as above, consistent with proper cryptographic practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Justified. No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- Similar to previous reports; standard utility functions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- Consistent with prior analyses.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to the sensitive nature of key material, which is reasonable.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward, well-structured.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — handling cryptographic keys always carries some risk if misused, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are appropriate given the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed. The code is a standard cryptographic utility with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior.",
