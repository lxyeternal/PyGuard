{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for generating, serializing, and converting RSA keys using the cryptography library, primarily for cryptographic key management.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'bit_strength' parameter for key generation, and the PEM/DER/OpenSSH key data passed into conversion functions.",
  "sinks": "Output data includes serialized RSA keys in various formats, returned as byte arrays. No data is directly written to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., key data, encoding options) are processed to produce serialized key bytes, following standard cryptographic serialization workflows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. Assertions enforce correct encoding usage but are not suspicious. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly utilizes the cryptography library to generate and serialize RSA keys in different formats. It includes functions to convert between DER and PEM formats, and from PEM to OpenSSH. The assertions and parameter checks prevent misuse, such as serializing private keys in insecure formats. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward cryptographic utility with proper practices and no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard RSA key management utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms. The design aligns with best practices for cryptographic operations.",
