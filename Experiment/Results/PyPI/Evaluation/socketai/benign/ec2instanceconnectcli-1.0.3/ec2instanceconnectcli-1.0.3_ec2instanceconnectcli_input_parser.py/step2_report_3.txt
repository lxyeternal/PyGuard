  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as input validation and parsing for EC2 connect commands, using regex for instance IDs, hostnames, regions, and zones.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data sinks or external calls. Data flows are limited to validation and structuring.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic execution. The code is standard for argument validation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded; no malware or security risks. Confidence 0.9 is appropriate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious behavior)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 (very low, just validation routines)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing validation of instance IDs, hostnames/IPs, and input arguments.\n- No signs of malicious activity, code injection, or backdoors.\n- The code is purely validation-focused.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0 (no risks identified)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- Also describes the code as input validation for EC2 connection commands.\n- Highlights regex validation, error handling, and no external or malicious activity.\n- No obfuscation or malicious behaviors detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 (still very low, mainly validation routines)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- Focuses on validation of target hostnames/IPs, instance IDs, and user inputs.\n- No network activity, code injection, or malicious behaviors.\n- The code is strictly validation and parsing.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 (minimal, just validation routines)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar validation-focused description, emphasizing correctness and security.\n- No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or data exfiltration.\n- The code is a standard argument parser and validator.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 (consistent with thorough validation)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, as no malicious activity, code injection, or backdoors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the validation nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a well-structured argument parser and validator for EC2 connect commands. It performs regex-based validation for instance IDs, hostnames, IP addresses, regions, and zones. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or dynamic execution. The validation routines are standard and do not introduce security vulnerabilities. The only potential concern would be if the validated data is used insecurely elsewhere, but within this code snippet, no such behavior exists.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (very low, since it's validation code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores provided in the reports are appropriate and align with the code's behavior.",
