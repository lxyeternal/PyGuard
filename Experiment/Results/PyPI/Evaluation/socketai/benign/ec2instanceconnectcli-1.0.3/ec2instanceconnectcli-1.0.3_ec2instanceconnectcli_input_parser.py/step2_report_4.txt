  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward parser and validator for EC2 connect commands, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code. Validation functions for instance IDs, hostnames, IP addresses, regions, and zones are used properly.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code performs standard validation routines, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The low malware and security risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing input validation for EC2 connect commands, with no malicious indicators.\n- **Findings:** Validates instance IDs, hostnames/IPs, usernames, regions, zones. No network activity or code injection.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on parsing and validation, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** Uses regex and socket functions for validation; raises errors on invalid data.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (still low)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code is purely validation-oriented, with no malicious intent. The slightly higher security risk score (0.2) is acceptable given the validation scope.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar validation and parsing, no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No network calls, data leaks, or code injections.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion is justified. The code is a safe utility for input validation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focused on validation, no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** Validates target data, no network or code injection.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code performs validation without malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.2, reflecting standard validation routines.\n\n**Potential issues:** The code does not execute commands or connect to networks; it only validates input. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious code, or sabotage.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal, mostly due to validation complexity, but no real security concern.\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a standard, well-implemented input validation utility for EC2 connection commands. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or dangerous behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| **0**          | **0**             | **0.1**   |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
