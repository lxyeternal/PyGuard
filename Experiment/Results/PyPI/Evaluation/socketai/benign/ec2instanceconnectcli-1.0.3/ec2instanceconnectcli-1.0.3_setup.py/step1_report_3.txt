  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'ec2instanceconnectcli' Python CLI tool for AWS EC2 Instance Connect.",
  "sources": "Reading version string from the package's __init__.py file, importing modules, and defining package requirements and setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script mainly reads static files and defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reading version from the source file → setting package configuration variables → executing setup() with the configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The script performs standard setup tasks with no obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules for file handling and package setup. It defines helper functions to read files and extract version strings via regex. The list of requirements is static, and the setup configuration is straightforward, specifying package metadata, scripts, and dependencies. There are no input sources that accept untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, nor any network or system calls that could be malicious. The code adheres to typical Python package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any suspicious or malicious code components.",
