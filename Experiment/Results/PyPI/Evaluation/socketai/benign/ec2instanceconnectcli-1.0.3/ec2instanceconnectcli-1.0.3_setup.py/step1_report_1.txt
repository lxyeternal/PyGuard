  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the ec2instanceconnectcli Python CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Reading version string from __init__.py, importing setup-related modules, reading package requirements, defining setup options.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Read version from source file -> configure package metadata and dependencies -> execute setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected; standard setup script structure.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines functions to read files and extract version info, specifies package requirements, and configures setup parameters. All code appears typical for a Python package setup. There are no external data inputs, dynamic code execution, or suspicious commands. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks detected. It securely reads version info, specifies dependencies, and prepares the package for distribution.",
