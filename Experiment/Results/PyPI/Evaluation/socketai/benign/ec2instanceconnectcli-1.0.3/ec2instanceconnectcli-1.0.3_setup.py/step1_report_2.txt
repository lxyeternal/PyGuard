  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package to facilitate AWS EC2 Instance Connect CLI tools.",
  "sources": "Reading version string from __init__.py file, importing package dependencies, reading files with codecs.open.",
  "targets": "No explicit untrusted data sources or inputs, and no sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A – the script reads package metadata and dependencies, then invokes setup with predefined parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors present. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python project. It reads the version from a local file, defines dependencies, and calls setuptools.setup(). No external input is processed, and there are no network operations, credential handling, or suspicious code constructs. The code appears to be straightforward and typical of Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is a standard packaging configuration for a Python CLI tool related to AWS EC2.",
