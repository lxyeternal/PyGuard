  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'ec2instanceconnectcli' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading version string from a specific file; importing modules; reading files for package description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data processing or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Reading version information from a file during setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed. Uses standard setup tools and conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration file for packaging Python software. It reads package version info from a specific file, defines dependencies, and specifies metadata and scripts for installation. No input from untrusted sources, no network calls, and no code execution beyond standard package setup procedures. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malware. The code adheres to common Python packaging practices without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign configuration file used for packaging and distribution.",
