{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'ec2instanceconnectcli' Python package, primarily for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from the package's __init__.py file; reads package files for setup; no direct input reading from external sources.",
  "sinks": "Uses setuptools to install dependencies; no apparent data sinks or transmission points; no network or data leak functions.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from package files, then proceeds with package setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscated parts, or hidden behaviors detected; standard setup.py structure; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that configures package installation parameters. It reads the version from a file using regex, specifies dependencies, and defines package metadata. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present, nor are there any obfuscated or hidden code segments. The dependencies are common and necessary for package operation. The script performs straightforward file reading and package configuration tasks, typical of open-source Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign setup configuration for packaging a Python CLI tool related to AWS EC2. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is standard, well-structured, and safe.",
