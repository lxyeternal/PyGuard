  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python CLI tool related to AWS EC2 Instance Connect.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected across all reports.\n- The code reads version info from a local file, specifies dependencies, and invokes setuptools.setup() with static data.\n- No external data sources, dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling are present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, indicating no security concerns.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is typical for a Python package setup script.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The functions for reading files and extracting version info are safe and standard.\n- The dependencies are static and well-known packages.\n- The scripts included are command-line tools, not suspicious binaries or scripts.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis aligns with my understanding after reviewing all reports.",
