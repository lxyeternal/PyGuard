{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup.py script used for packaging a Python CLI tool related to AWS EC2 Instance Connect. It defines dependencies, reads version info from a local file, and configures package metadata without performing any untrusted input handling or network operations.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from a local __init__.py file, static dependency declarations, static package data, and script files.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script is static and does not process data flows or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, well-structured, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python CLI tool. It reads version info via regex, declares dependencies ('cryptography' and 'botocore'), and invokes setuptools.setup() with static metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or untrusted data inputs. The functions are standard, and the overall structure is conventional. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
