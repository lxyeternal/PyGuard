The security risk is minimal, primarily due to temporary private key storage, which is standard practice. The malware score is zero, and the obfuscated score is zero, with a low security risk score of 0.2 justified by the temporary storage of sensitive data."

It performs necessary validation and delegates connection handling to external classes without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and the code's transparency and simplicity support a benign assessment."

It performs thorough validation without executing external commands or transmitting data. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The risk level is very low, and the malware score should remain at 0."
