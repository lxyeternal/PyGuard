{
  "purpose": "The code defines environment variable mappings and type sets for a CLI tool to connect to EC2 instances via AWS EC2 Instance Connect.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables via the EnvironmentVariables dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed for output or external effects.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read from the OS environment; they are used internally within the application logic (not shown).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code is straightforward and uses standard library imports and definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module, defines version information, and creates a dictionary 'EnvironmentVariables' mapping internal names to environment variable names, default values, and other parameters. It also sets up sets for scalar and complex data types. There are no functions, external data processing, or commands that could be exploited or indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be part of a larger CLI utility, with no suspicious behavior or malicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration snippet for a CLI tool that interfaces with AWS services. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured configuration setup.",
