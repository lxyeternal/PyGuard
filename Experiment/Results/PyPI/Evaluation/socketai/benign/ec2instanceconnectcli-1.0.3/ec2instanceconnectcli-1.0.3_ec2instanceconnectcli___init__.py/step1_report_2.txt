{
  "purpose": "Define environment variables and constants for an EC2 Instance Connect CLI tool, primarily for connecting to AWS EC2 instances.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables via the 'os' module and predefined environment variable mappings in 'EnvironmentVariables'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks (e.g., network connections, file writes, command executions) are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables (via 'os' or the predefined 'EnvironmentVariables') into internal variables, but no further processing or transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, defining constants and imports only.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' but does not utilize it actively in the snippet provided. It sets up environment variable mappings and defines constants for data types. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows indicating malicious activity. The license and descriptive comments are standard and do not suggest malicious intent. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup module for environment variables and data type definitions for an EC2 CLI tool. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks based on this snippet.",
