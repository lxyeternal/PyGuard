  "purpose": "Configuration setup for AWS EC2 CLI environment variables and data types.",
  "sources": "Environment variables defined in the dictionary 'EnvironmentVariables'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'os'; no functions or dynamic code execution; straightforward static code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple configuration module defining environment variables and data types for an EC2 CLI tool. It imports 'os' but does not utilize it, indicating potential for cleanup but no malicious intent. No network calls, data processing, or user input handling are present. The code contains no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated patterns. All signals point to benign, static configuration code with no suspicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward configuration code with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, reflecting the absence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
