  "purpose": "Defines environment variables and data types for an EC2 Instance Connect CLI tool, primarily for configuration and versioning.",
  "sources": "Imports from os module, and the __version__ variable; environment variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent or written to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration data is static or environment-based.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and appears to serve configuration purposes only.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, sets a version string, and defines a dictionary for environment variables. It also specifies sets of data types. There are no code execution, user input handling, or network operations. No obfuscation or malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign configuration snippet for an AWS EC2 CLI tool. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
