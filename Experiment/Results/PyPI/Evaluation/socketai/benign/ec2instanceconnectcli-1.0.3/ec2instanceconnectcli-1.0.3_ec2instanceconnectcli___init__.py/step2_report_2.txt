  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a straightforward configuration snippet, defining environment variables, data types, and version info.\n- No functions, user input handling, network operations, or external communications are present.\n- The code imports 'os' but does not utilize it actively in the provided snippet.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior is observed.\n- The purpose is clearly to set up environment variables and data type constants for an EC2 CLI tool.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- The environment variables are standard AWS configuration parameters.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks are identified.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **SecurityRisk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, as all assessments agree.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The code imports 'os' but does not use it. This is not a flaw but might be optimized by removing the import if unused.\n- The reports are consistent and justified.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n- The code is a benign configuration snippet.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content. The code is safe, straightforward, and serves a configuration purpose without any malicious intent.",
