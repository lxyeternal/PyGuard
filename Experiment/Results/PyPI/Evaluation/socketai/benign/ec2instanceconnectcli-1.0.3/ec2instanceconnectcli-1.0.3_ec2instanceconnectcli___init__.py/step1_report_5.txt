{
  "purpose": "The code is part of a command-line interface tool for connecting to EC2 instances via AWS EC2 Instance Connect, primarily for configuration and environment setup.",
  "sources": "EnvironmentVariables dictionary which reads environment variables such as AWS_CA_BUNDLE and AWS_DEFAULT_OUTPUT.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data is being used in critical system calls or external connections.",
  "flows": "Environment variable values could flow from user or system environment variables into the program, but are not used in any sensitive or dangerous context within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical configuration patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' but does not use it, defines version info, and sets up a dictionary for environment variables related to AWS configurations. There are no functions, network calls, or processing of untrusted input. The data structures are static and meant for configuration management. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a legitimate setup component for a CLI tool with no embedded malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet appears benign, primarily focusing on configuration and environment variable setup for an AWS EC2 CLI tool. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
