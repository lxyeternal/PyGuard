  "purpose": "Define environment variables and constants for an EC2 Instance Connect CLI tool.",
  "sources": "os module import and environment variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or interact with external systems in a potentially unsafe manner.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module, defines version information, and sets up a dictionary for environment variables with default values. It also defines sets for scalar and complex data types. There are no functions, user input handling, or external communications present. No code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is evident. The code appears to be a standard configuration setup for a CLI tool, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign configuration snippet for an EC2 CLI tool. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. The code is straightforward and appears safe.",
