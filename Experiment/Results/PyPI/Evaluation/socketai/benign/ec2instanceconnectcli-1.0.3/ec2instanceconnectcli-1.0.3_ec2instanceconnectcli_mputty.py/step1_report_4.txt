  "purpose": "This script facilitates SSH/SFTP connections to EC2 instances using Putty keys, parsing command-line arguments and managing connections.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments, reading from the identity (PPK) file.",
  "sinks": "Reading the identity file, potentially exposing its contents if mishandled; system calls to invoke SSH/SFTP commands.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> reading identity file -> validating key -> constructing command -> executing connection command.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; proper validation of the key file format. No suspicious network activity or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles argument parsing, reads a public key from a provided PPK file, validates the format, and constructs SSH/SFTP commands for EC2 instances. The key reading process extracts the key data based on expected file structure, avoiding insecure practices. The code's flow involves reading trusted input (the key file) and executing system commands based on user input, which appears standard and safe. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications, is evident. The key validation is appropriate, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for managing SSH/SFTP connections to EC2 instances using Putty keys. It performs expected validation and command execution with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
