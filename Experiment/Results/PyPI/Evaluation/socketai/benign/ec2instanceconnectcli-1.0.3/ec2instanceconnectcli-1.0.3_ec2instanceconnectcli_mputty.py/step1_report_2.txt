{
  "purpose": "The script facilitates SSH/SFTP connections to EC2 instances using keys in PuTTY format, parsing user input and executing commands accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reads identity key file in PuTTY format, reads command-line arguments, reads from standard input (if used), accesses files specified for public key parsing.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to stdout/stderr, terminates the program with sys.exit(), reads from files specified by the user, invokes external commands via EC2InstanceConnectCLI.",
  "flows": "Reads identity file -> Validates and extracts public key -> Parses command-line arguments -> Sets up logging and command parameters -> Calls external EC2InstanceConnectCLI commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network activity or system modifications observed; the code processes key files and command-line input in a typical manner.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles user input, file reading, and command execution related to establishing SSH/SFTP connections. It validates a PuTTY key file, extracts the public key, and uses external libraries to set up and run commands. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications, is evident. The key parsing is straightforward and appears intended for legitimate SSH key handling. No suspicious network activity or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard SSH/SFTP connection setup using user-provided keys and parameters, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as part of a legitimate EC2 instance connectivity tool without evidence of sabotage or malware.",
