  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward utility for establishing SSH/SFTP connections to EC2 instances using PuTTY keys. It performs necessary validation and delegates connection handling to external classes without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and the code's transparency and simplicity support a benign assessment."
