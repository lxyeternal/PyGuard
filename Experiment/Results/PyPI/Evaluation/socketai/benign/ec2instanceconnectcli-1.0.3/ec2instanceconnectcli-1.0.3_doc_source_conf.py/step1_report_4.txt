  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation generator for the AWS EC2 Instance Connect CLI project.",
  "sources": "Import statements for os and sys modules, sys.path modification, and static configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external or untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. No dynamic execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with static settings and import statements. It modifies sys.path for documentation purposes and sets project parameters, themes, and extension options. No external input handling, no network communication, no credential management, or code execution features are present. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears purely declarative and typical for a documentation configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a normal Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. It is a straightforward setup script for documentation generation.",
