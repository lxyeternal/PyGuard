  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-driven utility for managing EC2 SSH access and executing commands remotely. No malware or malicious intent is evident. The main security consideration is the use of shell=True, which should be managed with input validation if inputs are untrusted. The scores are consistent with the analysis: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2."
