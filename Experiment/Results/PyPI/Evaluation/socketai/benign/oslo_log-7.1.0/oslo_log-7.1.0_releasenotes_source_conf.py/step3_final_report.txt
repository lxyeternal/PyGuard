  "purpose": "Static configuration for Sphinx documentation setup, including extensions, theme, and project info.",
  "sources": "Comments, extension list, project metadata variables, theme setting, locale directories",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input; no data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration, no data flow or execution flow involving untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, declarative, and static",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Sphinx configuration script with comments, extension definitions, theme settings, and project info. It contains no dynamic code, network calls, or external data handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely declarative, setting parameters for documentation generation. Given its static and benign nature, there are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration file with no malicious intent or security issues. The existing scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
