  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is standard package setup script, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with setup_requires and pbr parameters. This is a typical setup script for Python packaging. No user input, no data processing, no external network calls, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious logic or behavior. It does not handle untrusted data or perform any operations beyond package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
