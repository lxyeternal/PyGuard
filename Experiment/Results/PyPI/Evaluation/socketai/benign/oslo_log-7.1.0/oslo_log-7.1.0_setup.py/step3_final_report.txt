{
  "purpose": "This code is a minimal Python setup script for packaging, importing setuptools and configuring setup parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause leaks or effects, as the code does not process external data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script simply calls setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard Python packaging script with no dynamic or malicious components. It contains no external data inputs, network calls, or obfuscated logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. The reasoning is consistent and appropriate given the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
