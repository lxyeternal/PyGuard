  "purpose": "Demonstrates setup and configuration of Oslo Logging in Python, including registering options, setting defaults, and initializing logging.",
  "sources": "Configuration variables via oslo_config, logging setup functions, and logging calls (LOG.info, LOG.debug, etc.).",
  "sinks": "Logging output to standard output; no external untrusted data sources or network activity.",
  "flows": "Configuration registration -> setting defaults -> setup -> logging messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code; no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward example of configuring Oslo Logging with no external data flows or malicious behavior. It uses standard functions and logging calls, with benign configuration strings. No anomalies or suspicious activities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign example of logging setup in Python with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The assigned scores accurately reflect its safety, and no modifications are necessary.",
