  "purpose": "Demonstrate usage of Oslo Logging library for logging in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Import statements for oslo_config and oslo_log; use of LOG object for logging; configuration functions (register_options, set_defaults, setup).",
  "sinks": "Logging output to standard error or configured handlers; no direct untrusted data sink identified.",
  "flows": "Initialization of configuration and logging setup in prepare(); logging calls (LOG.info, LOG.debug, LOG.warning, LOG.error, LOG.exception) after setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed. Usage is standard for logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports well-known logging and configuration libraries, registers options, sets default log levels, and performs setup with a specified domain. The logging calls after setup are standard and do not handle untrusted input. No suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious code are present. The only notable aspect is the addition of extra log levels, which is part of normal configuration. No anomalies or malicious intents are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward example of configuring and using Oslo Logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is very low.",
