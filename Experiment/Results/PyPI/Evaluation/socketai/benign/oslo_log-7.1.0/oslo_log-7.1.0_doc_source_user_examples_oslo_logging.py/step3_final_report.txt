  "purpose": "Set up minimal Oslo logging configuration and output log messages",
  "sources": "No external inputs or data sources; static import and setup calls",
  "sinks": "Log output to standard logging handlers; no untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Initialization of logging, then logging messages via LOG.info, LOG.warning, LOG.error",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup with no suspicious or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard logging setup using oslo_config and oslo_log libraries, registering options, setting up logging with a domain, and outputting three log messages. No external data, secrets, or dynamic behaviors are present. The code is simple, clear, and typical for OpenStack logging initialization. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The logging messages are static and benign. The code does not process untrusted input or perform any network or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward logging setup with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The scores should reflect this by being all zero.",
