  "purpose": "Demonstration of oslo.i18n integration module for implementing translation features in a project.",
  "sources": "Importing oslo_i18n module; calling oslo_i18n.get_available_languages(DOMAIN).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "The code initializes translation functions and retrieves available languages via oslo_i18n API.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a well-known open-source library (oslo.i18n) and sets up translation functions for a project domain. It provides a function to get available languages. All operations are straightforward and standard for internationalization purposes. No data leaks, no external network communication, and no code injection points are present. The code is a typical example of library usage with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of oslo.i18n for translation support. It contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and serves a benign purpose related to internationalization.",
