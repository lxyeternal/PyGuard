{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates integration of oslo.i18n translation module for internationalization support in a project.",
  "sources": "Imports the oslo_i18n module; calls oslo_i18n.get_available_languages() function.",
  "targets": "No explicit data sinks; no untrusted data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Calls get_available_languages() which retrieves supported languages; no data flow involving untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard open-source practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a well-known internationalization library (oslo_i18n) used in OpenStack projects. It sets up translation functions and a method to retrieve available languages. All functions and calls are standard and do not involve user input, network activity, or data leaks. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code's purpose is purely to facilitate translations and is consistent with documented usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as an example or utility for internationalization. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks identified. The structure and content are typical for open-source translation integration modules.",
