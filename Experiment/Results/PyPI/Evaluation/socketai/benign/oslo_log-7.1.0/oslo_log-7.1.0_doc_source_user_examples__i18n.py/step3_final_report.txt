  "purpose": "Implementation of oslo.i18n translation functions and retrieval of available languages for internationalization support.",
  "sources": "Import of oslo_i18n library, domain definition, creation of TranslatorFactory, and function call to get_available_languages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external network communication, or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code initializes translation functions from the oslo_i18n library and retrieves available languages without processing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard usage of the oslo.i18n library for internationalization. It sets up translation functions and retrieves available languages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not handle untrusted input or output data to external sinks. The structure and comments are typical for such utility modules. All indicators point to benign, well-understood library usage with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of oslo.i18n for translation support, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The analysis and reports are consistent and accurate.",
