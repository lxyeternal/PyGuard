{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates basic usage of Python's logging module for standard logging output",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; code uses static method calls",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs to console, no data sinks involved",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; static log messages are used",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors; code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, sets up a logger, and configures basic logging at INFO level. It then logs three static messages with different severity levels. There are no external inputs, no dynamic data, no network interactions, and no malicious code. It is a minimal, standard example of logging setup without any hidden or malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign example illustrating Python's logging functionality with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
