  "purpose": "Demonstrate the use of Python's standard logging library",
  "sources": "Logging functions (LOG.info, LOG.warning, LOG.error)",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs to console or log files via configured handlers",
  "flows": "Logging calls flow from LOG.* method calls to the logging handlers",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected; code appears straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, sets up a logger, configures basic logging at INFO level, and emits three log messages of different severity levels. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are present. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are observed. The code is a simple example of logging functionality with standard library use only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign example demonstrating Python's logging capabilities. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious or anomalous code, and poses no security risk.",
