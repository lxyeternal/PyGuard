{
  "purpose": "To demonstrate the usage of Python's standard logging library for informational, warning, and error messages.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources; it only initializes logging and logs static messages.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows; the code only logs static strings.",
  "flows": "No data flows from any source to sink, as there are no external inputs or dynamic data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and follows standard logging practices without hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, sets up a logger, configures basic logging at INFO level, and logs three static messages. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no sensitive information handling. The code appears to be a simple example or demonstration of Python logging, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign demonstration of Python's logging functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no anomalies. It is a standard, safe logging example.",
