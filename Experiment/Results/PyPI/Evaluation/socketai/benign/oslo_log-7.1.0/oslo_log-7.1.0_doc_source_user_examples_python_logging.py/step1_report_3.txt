  "purpose": "This code provides a simple example of using Python's standard logging module to log messages at various levels.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only initializes the logging configuration and logs static messages.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs log messages to the console or log handlers configured by logging.basicConfig.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are present; the log messages are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and does not contain suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up Python's logging with a default INFO level, then logs three static messages: an info, a warning, and an error. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no untrusted data handling. The code is standard and intended for demonstration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic example of Python logging without any malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard logging functions and does not include any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
