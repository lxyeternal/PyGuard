{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates basic Python logging setup with static messages.",
  "sources": "No external inputs or data sources; static code with no data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static logging calls only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard logging code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, configures basic logging at INFO level, and logs three static messages. It involves no external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is simple, clear, and adheres to standard practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example of Python logging with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safety and assign appropriate scores. No modifications are necessary.",
