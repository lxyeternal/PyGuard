  "purpose": "Define and manage a comprehensive list of classifiers for a Python package, including current and deprecated classifiers.",
  "sources": "Import statements, list definitions (sorted_classifiers), set creation (classifiers), dictionary of deprecated_classifiers, and combined list all_classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains data sinks or operations that process untrusted input, nor does it write data externally.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely constructs and combines static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is purely declarative, managing static classifier data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a large static list of classifiers, converts it to a set, and maintains a dictionary for deprecated classifiers with possible replacements. It then combines these into a sorted list. There are no input operations, external network calls, or dynamic code execution. All data appears static and intended for categorization purposes. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, declarative module managing classifiers for a Python package. It shows no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe and solely serves as a data structure definition.",
