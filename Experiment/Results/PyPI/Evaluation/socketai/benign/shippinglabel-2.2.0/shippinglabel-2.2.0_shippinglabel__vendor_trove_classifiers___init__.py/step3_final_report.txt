  "purpose": "Static data initialization for package classifiers and deprecated mappings, serving as configuration or metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; only defines static lists, sets, and dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static data structures (lists, sets, dictionaries) defining package classifiers and deprecated mappings. No dynamic code execution, input processing, or external interactions are present. The data is purely informational, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. No logical flaws or security concerns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, benign configuration module for package classifiers, with no malicious or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero. No adjustments are necessary.",
