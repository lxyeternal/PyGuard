      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard checksum utility module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is safe for supply chain use, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores assigned in the original reports are justified, though they could be slightly lowered to zero, as the code does not pose any security threat."

      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign utility for validating and parsing sdist filenames. It correctly raises exceptions for invalid or wheel files and uses standard practices. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk are justified."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, purpose-built for package management utilities, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate; the security risk score should be set to 0 to accurately reflect the benign nature."

The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and justified given the benign nature of the code."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for managing vendored dependencies with fallback import logic. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk present. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with a very low risk score due to the dynamic import, which is controlled and safe in this context."
