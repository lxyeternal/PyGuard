  "purpose": "Utilities for validating and deriving trove classifiers from requirements in Python packaging.",
  "sources": "Import statements (stdlib, third-party, local modules), function parameters, and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "stderr_writer calls that output warnings or errors, no external data sinks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input requirements are normalized and checked against known classifiers, then classifiers are yielded; no untrusted data flows into external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The use of stderr_writer for warnings is standard, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for validation and classifier suggestion based on requirements. It performs string comparisons, logging warnings for deprecated or unknown classifiers, and yields classifier strings based on requirements. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code injection. The code is straightforward and relies on standard library and known third-party modules. No network activity, system modifications, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for package classifier validation and suggestion, with no malicious intent or security issues identified.",
