  "purpose": "Utilities for validating and generating Python package classifiers based on requirements and known classifiers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as classifiers list and requirements collection; normalization of requirement names.",
  "sinks": "stderr_writer warnings about deprecated or unknown classifiers; yielded classifier strings.",
  "flows": "Input classifiers or requirements are processed, normalized, and checked against known lists; warnings are issued; classifiers are yielded based on requirements analysis.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward validation and generation logic, no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign validation of classifiers against known lists, warns about deprecated or unknown classifiers, and generates classifiers based on package requirements. It uses standard libraries and known dependencies, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Warnings are logged via stderr_writer, which is safe. The logic is simple string comparisons and mappings, with no external data leaks or unsafe operations. The overall structure is clean and intended for utility purposes, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility module for managing Python package classifiers. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and justified given the benign nature of the code.",
