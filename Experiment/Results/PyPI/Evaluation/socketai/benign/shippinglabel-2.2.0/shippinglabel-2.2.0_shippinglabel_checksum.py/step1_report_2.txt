  "purpose": "Utility functions for creating and verifying file SHA256 and MD5 hashes, and generating record entries for files.",
  "sources": "File input streams from filenames or file-like objects, reading files in chunks.",
  "sinks": "Hash computation and string formatting functions; no data is output or sent over networks.",
  "flows": "File streams are read in chunks, hashed, and results are returned as objects or strings; no external data flow or network activity present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of standard hashing functions and file handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides hashing utilities with support for both file paths and file-like objects, including hash verification and record generation. It employs standard libraries and appears to follow safe coding practices. No signs of obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or malicious intent. No external network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for hashing files and generating checksum records. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
