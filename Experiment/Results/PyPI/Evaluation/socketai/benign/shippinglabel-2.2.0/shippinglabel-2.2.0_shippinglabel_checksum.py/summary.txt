  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard checksum utility module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is safe for supply chain use, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores assigned in the original reports are justified, though they could be slightly lowered to zero, as the code does not pose any security threat."
