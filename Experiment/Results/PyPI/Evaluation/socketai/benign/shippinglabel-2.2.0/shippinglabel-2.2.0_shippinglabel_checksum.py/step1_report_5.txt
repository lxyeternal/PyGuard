  "purpose": "Utility functions for creating and verifying SHA256 and MD5 file hashes, as well as generating record entries for files.",
  "sources": "File inputs via filename parameters or file-like objects; reading file data in chunks.",
  "sinks": "Hash computation functions, digest comparisons, base64 encoding for record entries.",
  "flows": "Input files are read in chunks; hash objects update with data; hashes are returned or compared; record entries are generated using hash digest and file metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets; standard hashing and file handling. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard hashing utilities using hashlib, supports open file objects or filenames, and constructs record entries for package metadata. It performs safe file reads and hash comparisons. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious operations are detected. All functions adhere to common cryptographic practices, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard and legitimate utility for hash computation and verification. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this module.",
