  "purpose": "Utilities for creating and verifying file sha256 and md5 checksums, supporting both filenames and open file objects, and generating checksum record entries.",
  "sources": "File input via filename or open file object, reading file data in blocks.",
  "sinks": "Hash objects updating with file data, checksum string outputs, filename and size info in record entries.",
  "flows": "File data read from input, fed into hash update functions, resulting in hash digest or hexdigest, and checksum record strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no obfuscation or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of file hashing utilities using standard libraries. It supports both filenames and open file objects, performing typical hash calculations and comparisons. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The functions are well-structured, and the logic is clear and safe. No external or hidden data flows or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard checksum utility module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is safe for supply chain use, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores assigned in the original reports are justified, though they could be slightly lowered to zero, as the code does not pose any security threat.",
