{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for creating and verifying SHA256 and MD5 hashes of files, including support for open file objects and generating checksum records.",
  "sources": "Reads data from file objects (fp.read), file paths (open, cast), and file system (filename.stat()).",
  "sinks": "Hash calculation via hashlib update, digest generation, and base64 encoding; file opening for reading file data.",
  "flows": "Source: file data read via fp.read() or open() -> Hash update with file content -> Hash digest or hexdigest -> Return or compare hashes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of standard hashing functions and safe file handling.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs file hashing operations using standard hashlib functions, supports open files and filenames, and generates checksum records. No network operations, no secret extraction, or data exfiltration observed. Hash functions are used securely, and no obfuscated code or malicious behaviors detected. The code's purpose aligns with checksum generation and verification, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for hash calculation and verification. It contains no malicious behaviors, no hidden backdoors, and no suspicious activities. It solely performs cryptographic hashing of files as intended.",
