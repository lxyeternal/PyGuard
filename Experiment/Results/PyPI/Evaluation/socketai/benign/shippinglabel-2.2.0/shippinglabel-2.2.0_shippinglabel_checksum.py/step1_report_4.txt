  "purpose": "Utilities for creating and verifying SHA256 and MD5 checksums of files, including support for open file objects and record entry generation.",
  "sources": "File input via filename (path or open file object); optional relative path for record entries.",
  "sinks": "Hash computation and digest comparison; no direct data leakage or external communication present.",
  "flows": "File data is read in blocks, hashed, and the digest is used for comparison or encoding; no external data flows or network activities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of standard hashing libraries with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard library modules for hashing, reading files, and path manipulations. It supports hashing for both file paths and open file objects, with functions to verify hashes and generate record entries. No external network access, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling are present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of file checksum utilities with proper practices. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for checksum operations, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious data handling. Overall security risk is minimal.",
