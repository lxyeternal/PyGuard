  "purpose": "Import and print a list of classifiers from a vendored dependency module.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'sorted_classifiers' list from 'shippinglabel._vendor.trove_classifiers'.",
  "sinks": "Printing classifiers to standard output (console).",
  "flows": "Source: imported list -> sink: print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and print; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of a static list from a vendored module and iterates over it to print each classifier. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The module path indicates vendored dependencies, which is common. No suspicious logic, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The print statement could potentially leak internal classifier info, but this is minimal and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor security consideration is the potential information disclosure via printing classifiers, which is not a security threat. Overall, the code is straightforward and safe.",
