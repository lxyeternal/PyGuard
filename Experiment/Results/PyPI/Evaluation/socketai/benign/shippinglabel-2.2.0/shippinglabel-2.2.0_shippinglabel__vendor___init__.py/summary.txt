  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for managing vendored dependencies with fallback import logic. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk present. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with a very low risk score due to the dynamic import, which is controlled and safe in this context."
