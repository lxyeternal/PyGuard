  "sinks": [
    "re.fullmatch() if used with untrusted filename (not necessarily dangerous, but potential for malicious input parsing)",
    "super().__str__() in NotAnSdistError.__str__() (safe, as it uses the superclass string representation)"

  "flows": [
    "Input filename -> PathPlus conversion -> basename extraction -> regex matching -> return ParsedSdistFilename",
    "Filename validation and exception raising if conditions not met"
  ],
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. Usage of regex is standard and not obfuscated. The code is mainly for filename validation and parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for parsing source distribution filenames, including validation against a regex pattern. It raises exceptions for invalid filenames or wheel files. No code injection, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The modules used are for standard path and string processing. The exception handling appears to be standard for validation purposes. Overall, the code performs filename validation in a typical manner without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward filename parser for source distributions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any network activity, system modification, or data theft. The code is safe and intended solely for filename validation.",
