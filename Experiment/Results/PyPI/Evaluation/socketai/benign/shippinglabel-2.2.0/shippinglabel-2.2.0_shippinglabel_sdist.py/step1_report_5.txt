  "purpose": "Utilities for parsing and validating source distribution filenames in Python packages.",
  "sources": "The code reads input filenames provided as function arguments, primarily via the 'parse_sdist_filename' function.",
  "sinks": "The code processes filenames, raising exceptions for invalid or non-sdist files; no data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> Validation (file extension check) -> Regex matching -> Parsed components or exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of standard regex and exception handling is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and third-party packages to parse filenames based on a regex pattern. It raises specific exceptions if the filename is not an sdist or is invalid, and returns a structured object with filename components. There are no indications of malicious logic, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward utility module for filename validation.",
  "conclusion": "This source code performs standard filename parsing and validation for Python source distribution files. It does not contain any malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies. The code appears to be safe and legitimate.",
