  "anomalies": [
    "Explicit check for '.whl' extension to raise NotAnSdistError.",
    "No usage of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution.",
    "No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code.",
    "The code strictly performs filename validation and parsing.",
    "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script defines classes and functions for parsing Python package sdist filenames, with validation checks to distinguish between source distributions and wheel files. It uses regex for pattern matching and raises exceptions for invalid or non-sdist files. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, intended solely for filename validation, and contains no network, file system modifications, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs safe filename validation for Python sdist packages. It raises appropriate exceptions for invalid files or wheel files, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
