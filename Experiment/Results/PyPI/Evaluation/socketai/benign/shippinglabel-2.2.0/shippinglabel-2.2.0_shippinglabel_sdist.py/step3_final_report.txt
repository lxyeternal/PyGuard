  "purpose": "Utility for parsing Python package source distribution filenames, validating format, and distinguishing from wheel files.",
  "sources": "Filename input, os.path.basename extraction",
  "sinks": "Regex matching for filename components, exception raising for invalid files",
  "flows": "Input filename -> PathPlus conversion -> basename extraction -> regex match -> return parsed components or raise exception",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward filename validation using regex, raises exceptions for wheel files and invalid formats, and defines data structures for parsed filename components. It relies on standard libraries and third-party path handling. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The exception handling is standard, and the regex pattern is clear and specific. Overall, the code is a benign utility with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign utility for validating and parsing sdist filenames. It correctly raises exceptions for invalid or wheel files and uses standard practices. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk are justified.",
