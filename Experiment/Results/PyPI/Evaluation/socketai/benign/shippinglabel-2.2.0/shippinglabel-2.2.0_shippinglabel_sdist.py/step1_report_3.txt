  "purpose": "Utilities for parsing and handling source distribution filenames in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Reading filename input via function argument; extracting basename from PathPlus object; reading filename suffix.",
  "sinks": "Potentially raises exceptions based on filename validation; no direct data leaks or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Input filename → PathPlus object → basename extraction → regex matching → return parsed object or raise exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; code performs standard filename parsing. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures, exceptions, and a function for parsing distribution filenames. It validates filename suffixes and matches against a regex pattern. Raises exceptions if filename is a wheel or does not conform to expected pattern. Uses standard libraries and third-party packages for path handling and regex. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. It appears to be a benign utility module for filename validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard filename parsing utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It validates filenames and raises exceptions on invalid input, serving a legitimate purpose within a package distribution context.",
