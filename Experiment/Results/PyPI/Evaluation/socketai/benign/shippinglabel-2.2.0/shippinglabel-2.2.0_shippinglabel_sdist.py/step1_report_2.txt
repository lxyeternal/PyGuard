  "flows": [
    "Input filename -> PathPlus conversion -> basename extraction -> regex match -> parsing result.",
    "Filename validation -> exception if not sdist -> exception if wheel file.",
    "Successful parsing -> return ParsedSdistFilename object."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns.",
    "No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
    "Exception message formatting using the filename's representation, which is safe.",
    "Use of third-party libraries is standard and not suspicious."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility for handling sdist filenames. It includes proper validation to exclude wheel files and uses regex to parse filenames. It raises specific exceptions for invalid files, adhering to expected patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data leakage, or backdoors. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and serves a legitimate purpose in parsing sdist filenames. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The implementation follows standard practices and does not raise any security concerns.",
