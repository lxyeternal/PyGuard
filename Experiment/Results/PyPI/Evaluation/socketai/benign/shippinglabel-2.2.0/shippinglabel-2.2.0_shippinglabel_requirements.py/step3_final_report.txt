  "purpose": "Utilities for working with :pep:`508` requirements, including parsing, normalization, combining, and reading dependencies from files and project metadata.",
  "sources": "File reading (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml), distribution metadata, input strings, and internal functions.",
  "sinks": "No execution of untrusted data; data flows through parsing, normalization, and file writing.",
  "flows": "Input data (requirements, metadata) is parsed and normalized; the `_denormalize_ruamel` function modifies requirement names for compatibility; no external system calls or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "The `_denormalize_ruamel` function adjusts requirement names for compatibility with certain packages; this is a benign workaround, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured utility for managing Python project requirements, leveraging standard libraries and practices. It performs parsing, normalization, merging, and writing requirements files. The only noteworthy point is the `_denormalize_ruamel` function, which modifies requirement names for compatibility reasons. This is a documented, benign workaround and does not introduce any malicious behavior or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious code patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low risk: 0–0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard requirements management utility with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The minor workaround for `ruamel.yaml` is a known, benign compatibility fix. Overall, the code is very low risk and safe for use.",
