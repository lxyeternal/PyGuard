  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard requirement management, reading from files and distribution metadata.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No execution of untrusted data; data flows through parsing and normalization.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; the only noteworthy aspect is the `_denormalize_ruamel` function, which modifies requirement names for compatibility.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical, well-structured utility with no malicious behavior. The `_denormalize_ruamel` function is a benign workaround, not a security concern.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. Confidence: 1.0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard dependency parsing and management.\n- **Anomalies:** Same workaround in `_denormalize_ruamel`.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (slightly higher but still very low). Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on dependency parsing, no network or system modifications.\n- **Anomalies:** Same workaround; benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. Confidence: 1.0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar assessment; standard parsing and normalization.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; minor warning for `_denormalize_ruamel`.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1. Confidence: 1.0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion: utility for requirements management, no malicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** Minor workaround for 'ruamel.yaml'.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.0. Confidence: 1.0.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports agree that no malware is present. The code is a standard requirements utility.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and uses common libraries.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** The very low risk scores (0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The only \"anomaly\" is the `_denormalize_ruamel` workaround, which is a known, documented compatibility fix, not malicious.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation Scores:** Both should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Overall Confidence:** High, given the consistent assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is transparent and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — the code performs standard dependency management functions with no security concerns.\n\n**Note:** The slight risk scores (0.1) assigned in some reports are acceptable given the workaround, but overall, the code remains very low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Recommendation |\n|-------------------|----------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                    |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                    |\n| Security Risk     | 0                    |\n\nThe code is a legitimate, standard utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
