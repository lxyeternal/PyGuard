  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling package versioning, normalization, and reading virtual environment configuration files.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as re, typing, and third-party libraries; reads lines from 'pyvenv.cfg' in a specified directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; code mainly performs string processing and file reading without writing or executing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input data from function parameters (version strings, directory paths) flows through filtering, regex normalization, and file reading to produce outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs observed. The code uses standard patterns and libraries for its purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for filtering versions, normalizing package names, and reading configuration files. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The code operates purely on provided inputs and file data, with no external connections or executable code execution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing standard package utility functions. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
