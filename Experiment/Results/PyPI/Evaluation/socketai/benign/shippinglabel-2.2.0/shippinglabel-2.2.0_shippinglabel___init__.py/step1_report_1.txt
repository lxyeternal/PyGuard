  "sources": "Reading lines from a file ('pyvenv.cfg') in read_pyvenv; importing external libraries",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks found; no untrusted data is processed or written to external systems",
  "flows": "Input from filesystem (pyvenv.cfg) to data structure; no data flows to external systems or network",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions for version filtering, string normalization, and configuration reading. All operations are standard and involve safe handling of data. No external inputs are used maliciously, no network activity or code injection present. The import statements are for legitimate libraries, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, purpose-built utility functions with no signs of malware, malicious activity, or security risks.",
