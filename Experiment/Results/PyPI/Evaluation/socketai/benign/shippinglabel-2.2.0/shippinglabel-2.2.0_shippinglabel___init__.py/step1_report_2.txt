  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling Python package names, versions, and virtual environment configurations.",
  "sources": "User-provided input through parameters (e.g., version strings, path strings, package names), reading lines from a file (pyvenv.cfg).",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks, command execution, or malicious actions; no data being sent externally or executed unsafely.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through functions for filtering, normalization, and file reading, with no risky processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of regular expressions and standard library functions appears straightforward. The code handles file reading and string processing securely. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for version filtering, string normalization, and reading configuration files. Version filtering uses standard packaging library functions; normalization uses regex substitution. Reading pyvenv.cfg involves reading lines and splitting on a delimiter, with no external network communication or command execution. No anomalous, suspicious, or malicious patterns are evident. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be benign, providing utility functions for package and environment handling without any malicious intent or security risks. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries appropriately.",
