  "purpose": "Utility functions for filtering versions, normalizing package names, and reading virtual environment configuration files.",
  "sources": "Reading lines from 'pyvenv.cfg' file in the specified directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; file reading is from local filesystem only.",
  "flows": "Reading 'pyvenv.cfg' lines, splitting on ' = ', and storing key-value pairs in a dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "Potential assumption that each line contains ' = ' without validation, which could raise an exception if malformed, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions with no dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The functions operate on trusted inputs or filesystem data. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The import statements are from legitimate libraries. The only minor concern is the assumption in 'read_pyvenv' that each line contains ' = ', which could be made more robust, but this does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purpose-built for package management utilities, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate; the security risk score should be set to 0 to accurately reflect the benign nature.",
