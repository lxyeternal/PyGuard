  "sources": "Reading lines from 'pyvenv.cfg' file in read_pyvenv function.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input from file read in read_pyvenv -> parsed into dictionary; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious function behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for version filtering, string normalization, and reading virtual environment configuration files. The functions use safe, well-understood Python library features. No external network communication, no dynamic code execution, and no data leaks or backdoors are present. The code appears to be purely utility and does not perform any malicious or suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for package handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
