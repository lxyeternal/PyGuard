  "purpose": "Integrates Sentry error tracking with Django to pass correlation IDs as transaction_id tags.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.core.exceptions, django_guid.integrations, and local imports; input data from parameters like guid.",
  "sinks": "Uses sentry_sdk to set tags within scope/context managers.",
  "flows": "The guid parameter flows into sentry_sdk's scope/tag setting functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or hidden behavior. The code properly checks for sentry_sdk installation and version.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Django exceptions and a third-party integration. It verifies the presence of the sentry_sdk package, raising an exception if not installed. In the run method, it dynamically imports sentry_sdk and sets a transaction_id tag based on the SDK version, using appropriate scope management functions. All operations are standard for a logging/monitoring integration with no signs of malicious activity or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for passing transaction IDs to Sentry for tracing purposes. There are no malicious behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious code patterns.",
