{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to integrate with Sentry for error tracking, passing transaction IDs for better request correlation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules 'logging', 'typing', and 'django.core.exceptions'; dynamic import of 'sentry_sdk' within methods.",
  "sinks": "Setting of Sentry tags via 'sentry_sdk' methods; logging of debug messages.",
  "flows": "Importing 'sentry_sdk' in 'setup' to verify installation; using 'sentry_sdk' within 'run' to set 'transaction_id' tag in scope based on version.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; standard use of exception handling for missing modules; proper version checking and scope setting.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard integration setup for Sentry, ensuring the SDK is installed before use. The dynamic import within 'setup' and 'run' prevents unnecessary dependency loading unless needed. The version check differentiates between SDK versions to call the correct context manager for setting tags. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. Logging is limited to debug information. The code does not perform any network operations, data leakage, or system modifications. It follows expected practices for SDK integration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Sentry integration with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It securely verifies dependencies, sets transaction IDs, and logs debug info. There are no anomalies or malicious signals.",
