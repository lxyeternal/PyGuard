  "purpose": "Manage GUIDs within a Django project, providing functions to clear, get, and set GUIDs, with compatibility for different Django versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django and django_guid.api functions, version string definition, Django version check for configuration, and function exports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, external network communications, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Import of GUID functions (clear_guid, get_guid, set_guid) -> usage within Django app setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django configuration module that imports necessary functions, defines version info, conditionally sets app configuration based on Django version, and exposes functions. It contains no external data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is standard for Django apps, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Django setup snippet for GUID management, with no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports accurately reflect this, and the scores are appropriate.",
