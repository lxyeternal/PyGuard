  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `django` and functions (`clear_guid`, `get_guid`, `set_guid`) from `django_guid.api`.\n- Sets a version string `__version__`.\n- Checks Django version to conditionally set `default_app_config`.\n- Defines `__all__` for exported functions.\n\n**Security Analysis:**\n- No untrusted data is processed.\n- No external network communication.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code structures.\n- The functions imported are intended for GUID management, which is a benign utility.\n- The code is typical for a Django app setup or configuration module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- No errors, flaws, or security flaws are evident.\n\n### Logical or Reasoning Flaws:\n- None identified. The report correctly states that this is standard setup code.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating certainty about benign nature.\n- The reasoning in all reports aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n\n### Potential Risks:\n- Since the code only performs import and configuration, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- No reason to assign higher scores unless future context indicates malicious usage.\n\n### Malware and Obfuscation:\n- The malware score should be 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- Obfuscation score should be 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n### Overall:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign, with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is standard Django setup code with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical Django app configuration snippet for GUID management, with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores and reasoning in the reports are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
