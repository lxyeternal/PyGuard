{
  "purpose": "This code imports Django framework and a specific API module related to GUID management, and sets configuration based on Django version.",
  "sources": "Import statements for django and django_guid.api, version assignment, conditional assignment based on django.VERSION",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and sets configuration variables",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports Django modules and a specific GUID API, then sets a configuration variable based on Django version. The __all__ list exposes imported functions. No external data inputs, user inputs, or dynamic behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and appears to be standard setup code for a Django app component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration/setup module with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply manages imports and version-dependent configuration.",
