{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for managing GUIDs within a Django project, exposing functions to clear, get, and set GUIDs via django_guid.api.",
  "sources": "Importing functions from django_guid.api and accessing django.VERSION",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output actions",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to critical functions; no source-to-sink paths present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import and configuration setup, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django and specific API functions from django_guid.api, declares a package version, and conditionally sets default_app_config based on Django version. All actions are standard for Django apps setup. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior. The functions imported are intended for GUID management, and no untrusted data handling or external communications are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup snippet for a Django app, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and intended solely for GUID management within a Django project.",
