{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for managing GUIDs within a Django project, including version handling and importing related functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'import django' and 'from django_guid.api import clear_guid, get_guid, set_guid'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the imported functions may be used elsewhere in the project, but this code itself does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this snippet; it primarily sets up imports and configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard Django version checks and imports. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django and specific GUID-related functions from a module 'django_guid.api'. It sets a version string and conditionally assigns a default app configuration based on Django version. No input handling, no data processing, and no suspicious code structures are present. The code appears to serve as part of a larger Django app setup, with no malicious or malicious-looking behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Django application configuration code that imports and sets up GUID management functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
