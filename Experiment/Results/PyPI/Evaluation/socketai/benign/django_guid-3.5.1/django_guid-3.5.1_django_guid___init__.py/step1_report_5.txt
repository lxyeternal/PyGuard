  "purpose": "This code appears to be a simple Django package module that provides API functions for managing GUIDs within a Django project.",
  "sources": "Imports from django and django_guid.api; reading version info, and setting default_app_config based on Django version",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is sent to external sources or untrusted sinks",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no external data manipulation observed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual constructs, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and standard for a Django app module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django and specific functions from a local API module. It sets a version string and conditionally defines a Django app config based on the Django version. No user input, environment variables, or external data handling is present. The functions imported and variables used are standard for Django applications. There are no suspicious behaviors, code injections, or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django module for GUID management with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs configuration based on Django version and exports API functions, all without malicious behavior.",
