{
  "purpose": "This module imports Django framework and a custom package 'django_guid.api' to manage GUIDs within a Django application, and sets some version-dependent configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'django' and 'django_guid.api', version assignment, and conditional setting of 'default_app_config'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is processed or output. No sensitive data handling or external network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up module-level configurations and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward configuration and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Django framework and a specific API from 'django_guid'. It assigns a version string and conditionally sets 'default_app_config' based on Django's version, which is standard practice for Django apps. No external data inputs, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity are present. The structure and syntax are typical for a Django app module, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django app configuration module with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply manages module imports and version-dependent configuration.",
