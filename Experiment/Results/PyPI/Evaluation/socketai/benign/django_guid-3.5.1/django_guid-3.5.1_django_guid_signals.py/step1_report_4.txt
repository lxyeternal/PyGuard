  "purpose": "Handle Django's request_finished signal to clear a GUID from context when a request completes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'guid' context variable via guid.set(None). It also receives signal data via 'sender' and 'kwargs', but does not process them directly.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the call to guid.set(None), which clears the GUID stored in the context variable.",
  "flows": "Signal reception (request_finished) → calling guid.set(None) to clear context data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns. The code appears standard for signal handling and context cleanup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a receiver function for Django's request_finished signal. When triggered, it logs the event and clears the GUID stored in the context variable. No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, no external network activity, and no malicious code are present. The code performs a simple cleanup task in a standard manner.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard Django signal handler for cleaning up context data after request completion. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
