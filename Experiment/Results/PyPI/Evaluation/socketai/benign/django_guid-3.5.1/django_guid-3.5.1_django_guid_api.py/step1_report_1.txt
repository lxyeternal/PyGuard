{
  "purpose": "Manage and manipulate a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) associated with the current request context using a context variable.",
  "sources": "Read operations from guid.get() to retrieve the current GUID; input parameter new_guid in set_guid()",
  "sinks": "guid.set() function to update the GUID; logging statements that record GUID changes",
  "flows": "Input parameter new_guid flows into guid.set() in set_guid(); current GUID from guid.get() flows into logging and guid.set() in set_guid() and clear_guid()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors; no malicious code or privacy violations detected; logging is standard for debugging/audit purposes",
  "analysis": "The code uses the django_guid.context.guid context variable to get, set, and clear a GUID value associated with the request. It includes logging for changes, which is typical for request tracing. There are no indications of malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The functions are simple and straightforward, with no obfuscation or dangerous patterns. The code does not perform network operations, handle sensitive data beyond the GUID, or include any secret keys or credentials.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard request context management utility with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It primarily serves to track request identifiers for debugging or logging purposes.",
