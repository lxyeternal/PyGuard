  "purpose": "Manage a GUID within the request context for tracing purposes.",
  "sources": "Calls to guid.get() and guid.set() for retrieving and assigning the GUID.",
  "sinks": "guid.set() potentially affecting the request context; logging outputs.",
  "flows": "get_guid() retrieves GUID; set_guid(new_guid) updates GUID and logs; clear_guid() resets GUID and logs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward functions to get, set, and clear a GUID stored in a ContextVar-like object. It uses standard logging to record changes. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The functions are simple wrappers around the ContextVar, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The code relies on the external 'django_guid' package, but within this snippet, no malicious activity is evident. The logging of GUID changes is typical for request tracing and does not pose security risks. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing request GUIDs in a Django application. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify its purpose and security posture, and the scores are justified.",
