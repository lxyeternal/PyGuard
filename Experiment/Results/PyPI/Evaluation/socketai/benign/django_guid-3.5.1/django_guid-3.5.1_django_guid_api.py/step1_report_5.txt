  "purpose": "Manage and log a GUID for the current request context using django_guid's ContextVar",
  "sources": "The guid.get() method, which retrieves the current GUID from the ContextVar",
  "sinks": "The guid.set() method, which assigns a new GUID to the ContextVar",
  "flows": "Source (guid.get()) to sink (guid.set()), used in set_guid and clear_guid functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to get, set, and clear a GUID within the current request context using django_guid. It logs changes when the GUID is updated or cleared. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are processed directly; the functions operate on internal ContextVar state. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of logging is standard for debugging and audit purposes. The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple request context management utility that logs GUID changes. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, and there are no security concerns identified in this module.",
