  "sinks": "Invocation of integration methods which could execute external code if integrations are malicious.",
  "flows": "Loading settings -> validating types and method signatures -> calling integration.setup() and other methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard validation routines. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code loads configuration data, validates types and method signatures, and invokes setup methods on integrations. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The main security concern is trusting external integrations, which could execute malicious code during their method calls. The validation routines are thorough, and the code structure is standard for plugin systems. No signs of malware or obfuscation are detected. The risk score reflects potential danger if integrations are compromised, but the code itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured configuration handler with thorough validation. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The primary security risk stems from external integrations, not the code itself. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and justified.",
