  "purpose": "Middleware and request processing functions for handling GUIDs in Django requests and responses, including integration execution.",
  "sources": "request headers (get_id_from_header), settings (settings.integrations, settings.guid_header_name, settings.expose_header), environment configuration (apps.is_installed)",
  "sinks": "response headers (adding GUID and expose headers), integration methods (integration.run and integration.cleanup)",
  "flows": "get_id_from_header reads input header -> guid.set stores GUID -> integrations are run -> response headers are modified -> integrations cleanup",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; use of standard Django middleware patterns; no obfuscated or suspicious code features",
  "analysis": "The code implements middleware to handle GUIDs in HTTP requests and responses. It checks installed apps, processes incoming headers, sets GUIDs in context variables, and modifies response headers. It runs integrations' run and cleanup methods, which could be a concern if integrations are malicious but are part of the expected plugin architecture. The code uses standard Django patterns, imports, and logging. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors are present. No suspicious or anomalous code behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django middleware implementation for GUID management, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. All actions align with expected functionality, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is identified.",
