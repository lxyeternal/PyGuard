  "purpose": "Middleware for handling GUIDs in Django requests, managing request and response processing, and integrating with external systems.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from Django HttpRequest headers via get_id_from_header(request). No other external or untrusted sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "GUIDs are injected into response headers via response[settings.guid_header_name]. No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input from request headers (get_id_from_header) flows through process_incoming_request, then into integrations. GUIDs are injected into responses and passed to integrations' cleanup methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual behavior observed. The code primarily manages middleware logic and calls external integration methods.",
  "analysis": "The code manages GUID handling within Django middleware, with standard practices such as context variables and request/response processing. It loads external integrations and logs activity. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is present. The use of 'guid' and headers appears legitimate, and there are no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django middleware implementation for GUID handling, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not include harmful behaviors such as data theft, backdoors, or malicious network activity.",
