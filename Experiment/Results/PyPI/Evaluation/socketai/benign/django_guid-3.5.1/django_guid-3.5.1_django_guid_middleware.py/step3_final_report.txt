  "purpose": "Middleware for managing GUIDs in Django requests and responses, integrating external plugins and storing GUIDs in context.",
  "sources": "Request headers (get_id_from_header), external integrations (settings.integrations), response headers (settings.guid_header_name).",
  "sinks": "Response headers (setting GUID header), external integration methods (run, cleanup).",
  "flows": "Request headers -> guid.set() -> integrations.run() -> response headers -> integrations.cleanup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; external integrations are external but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django middleware handling GUIDs, supporting both sync and async views. It reads GUIDs from request headers, stores them in context, and adds them to response headers if configured. External integrations are invoked during request processing and cleanup, which could be a vector if malicious, but no such behavior is evident. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature and external plugin architecture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured middleware component with external hooks. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The risk mainly stems from external integrations, but within this code, it remains low. The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
