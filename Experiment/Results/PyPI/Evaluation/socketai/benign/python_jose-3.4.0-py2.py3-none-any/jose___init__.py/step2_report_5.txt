  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine whether the findings are accurate, consistent, and reasonable.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward package metadata and import statements.\n- No dynamic code, external data, or suspicious constructs are mentioned.\n- The import statements are from local modules, with no indication of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the descriptions.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The **original code** matches the descriptions: static assignment of metadata and import statements for exception classes.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks is present in the code snippets.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Checks:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is static, safe, and typical for Python package initialization.\n- They correctly note that import statements do not process untrusted data or involve data flows.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or signs of malicious intent are detected.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware score:** all reports have 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** all 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** all 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- Since the code is purely metadata and imports, the risk scores seem appropriate.\n- The reports are thorough and do not overstate or understate the risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The **scores** assigned in each report are reasonable and justified.\n- The **analyses** are accurate and consistent.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, and the code appears benign.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and well-justified. The code is standard package metadata and import statements with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe, and the scores are correct.",
