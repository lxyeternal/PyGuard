  "purpose": "Defines package metadata (__version__, __author__, etc.) and imports exception classes from a local module (.exceptions).",
  "sources": "Static assignment of metadata variables; import statements from a local module (.exceptions).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static code with no dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static assignments and imports; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static package metadata variables and imports exception classes from a local module, which is typical in Python packages. There are no dynamic behaviors, external inputs, network calls, or data processing. The import statements are safe and standard. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is simple, static, and benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization snippet with no malicious or security concern. All signals indicate benign behavior, and the scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk should remain at 0. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
