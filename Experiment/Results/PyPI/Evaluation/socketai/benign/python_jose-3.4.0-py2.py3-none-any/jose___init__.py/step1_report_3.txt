  "purpose": "Define package metadata and import specific exception classes from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing exception classes from the 'exceptions' module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Import statements do not involve data flow from untrusted sources; they simply import classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. The code appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata variables such as version, author, license, and copyright. It then imports several exception classes from a local 'exceptions' module. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, no dynamic code execution, or unsafe data handling present. The code is typical for initializing a Python package and does not contain any indicators of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package initialization script setting metadata and importing exceptions. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
