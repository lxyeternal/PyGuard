{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and import specific exception classes for error handling within a JWT-related library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for exception classes from a local module (.exceptions). No external input or data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing present; the code only imports classes and sets metadata variables.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only initializes metadata variables and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code consists solely of metadata variables and straightforward import statements without any dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata variables such as version, author, license, and copyright. It then imports specific exception classes from a local module named .exceptions. The import statements include noqa comments for linter suppression but do not involve any dynamic execution or suspicious behavior. There are no input sources, no data processing, no network communication, or file operations that could indicate malicious activity. The code appears to be standard for a Python package that handles JWT or JOSE-related errors, likely part of a larger library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely informational and import-based with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as part of a package setup or module initialization, with no indication of supply chain attack vectors or malicious intent.",
