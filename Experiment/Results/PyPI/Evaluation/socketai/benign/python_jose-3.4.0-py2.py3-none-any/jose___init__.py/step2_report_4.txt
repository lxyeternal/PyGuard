  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and assess the validity of their conclusions, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code snippets are straightforward package metadata assignments and import statements from a local module (`.exceptions`).\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, external inputs, network calls, or data processing.\n- The import statements are static and standard for Python packages.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and pose no security risks, which aligns with the code provided.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review per report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Define package metadata and import exception classes.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies that the code is standard and safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on metadata and imports.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct, straightforward, safe.\n- **Scores:** All zero or maximum confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct, standard code.\n- **Scores:** All zero or maximum confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct, safe.\n- **Scores:** All appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as others.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** All appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n\n- **Code presence:** Confirmed to be simple package metadata and import statements.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risk:** None detected.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** Unwarranted; the code is static and standard.\n- **Scores consistency:** All are consistent with the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The malware score should remain at **0**, as there is no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score should be **0**, no obfuscation present.\n- The overall risk score should be **0**, reflecting no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n**The provided code is a standard, safe package initialization snippet with no malicious or suspicious elements.** The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified given the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
