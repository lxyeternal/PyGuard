{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and import exception classes for a Python package, likely related to JWT or JOSE handling.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of package metadata; import statements importing exception classes from local module.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only static imports and metadata assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package metadata and import statements without obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets package information such as version, author, license, and copyright. It imports specific exception classes from a local exceptions module. There are no dynamic code executions, external data reads, or potential attack vectors. The import statements are standard and limited to exception handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package setup code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely contains metadata and import statements for exception classes, typical of a Python library module.",
