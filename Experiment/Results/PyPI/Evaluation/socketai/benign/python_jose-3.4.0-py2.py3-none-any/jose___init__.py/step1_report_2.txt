  "purpose": "Define module metadata and import specific exceptions from a local exceptions module.",
  "sources": "Module metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __license__, __copyright__) and import statements for exception classes from a relative exceptions module.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static metadata and imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of metadata definitions and import statements with no dynamic or potentially malicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata and imports exception classes from a local module. There are no user inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The import statements are standard for Python packages, and the metadata variables are straightforward. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module setup with metadata and exception imports, presenting no malicious intent or security risks.",
