  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as setting package metadata and importing exception classes from a local module.\n- There are no dynamic operations, external inputs, or network interactions.\n- The code snippets are standard for Python package initialization (`__version__`, `__author__`, etc., and import statements).\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware and security risk scores at 0, which appears appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**Specific analysis:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - *Purpose:* Correctly describes the code's function.  \n   - *Assessment:* No issues; import statements are safe, and no malicious behavior is indicated.  \n   - *Scores:* Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0 — reasonable.\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - *Purpose:* Same as above, accurate.  \n   - *Assessment:* No issues; standard package setup.  \n   - *Scores:* Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - *Purpose:* Similar description, consistent.  \n   - *Assessment:* No suspicious activity or anomalies.  \n   - *Scores:* Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0 — justified.\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - *Purpose:* Correctly states the code's intent.  \n   - *Assessment:* No signs of malicious activity.  \n   - *Scores:* Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - *Purpose:* Accurate.  \n   - *Assessment:* No issues.  \n   - *Scores:* Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0 — justified.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The code snippets are simple package metadata and import statements, common in Python modules.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports aligns with the content.\n- The risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the lack of any active or potential security issues.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final note:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. No changes are necessary. The code is benign and typical for package initialization.",
