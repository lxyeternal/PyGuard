  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the context provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Assigns package metadata variables (__version__, __author__, etc.).\n- Imports exception classes from a local module (.exceptions).\n\n**Key observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as standard package initialization with no dynamic behavior, external inputs, or malicious activity.\n- No signs of obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious code are evident.\n- The import statements are straightforward, importing exception classes from a local module, which is typical in Python packages.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, dynamic code execution, or external data handling.\n- The import statements are safe and standard.\n- Package metadata variables are static and do not pose security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the reports' reasoning and scores:\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n- Malware: 0 across all reports.\n- Obfuscated: 0 across all reports.\n- Security risk: 0 across all reports.\n\nThese are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n**Potential inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent; they uniformly conclude no malicious activity or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code only contains static metadata and import statements, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- No reason exists to assign higher scores unless additional context or code is provided.\n\n---\n\n### Malware score:\n- The code does **not** perform any malicious actions.\n- The import of exception classes from a local module is benign, assuming the local module is trustworthy.\n- The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious patterns.\n\n**Thus, malware score should remain at 0.**\n\n---\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities:\n- The code snippet is isolated and appears safe.\n- No assumptions about malicious behavior are justified based solely on this code.\n- The only concern could be the trustworthiness of the local `.exceptions` module, but that is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**These scores are consistent with the code's nature.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall recommendation:\n- The code is standard, safe, and contains no security issues.\n- The scores assigned by all reports are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical package initialization snippet with no malicious or security concern. The scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
