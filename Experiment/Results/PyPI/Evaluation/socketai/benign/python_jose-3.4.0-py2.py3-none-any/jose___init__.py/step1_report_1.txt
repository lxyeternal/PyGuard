  "purpose": "Define package metadata and import exception classes for handling errors related to JSON Web Tokens (JWT).",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version, author, license, copyright; import statements for exception classes from local module.",
  "sinks": "Import statements do not involve untrusted data or external input; no data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; import statements are static and safe.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns package metadata attributes and imports specific exception classes from a local module. All actions are static and standard for Python package initialization. There are no dynamic evaluations, external inputs, or suspicious patterns. Importing exception classes does not pose security risks unless the imported code is malicious, which cannot be determined solely from this snippet. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package metadata and import statements with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
