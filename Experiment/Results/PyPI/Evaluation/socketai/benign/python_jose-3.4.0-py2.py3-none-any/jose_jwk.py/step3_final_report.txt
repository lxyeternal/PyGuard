  "purpose": "Manage cryptographic key classes and algorithms, dynamically importing backend classes based on algorithm identifiers, constructing key objects from provided data, and allowing registration of new key classes.",
  "sources": "ALGORITHMS constants, key_data input, algorithm parameter",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of key classes, modification of ALGORITHMS.KEYS and ALGORITHMS.SUPPORTED",
  "flows": "Input data and algorithm parameter flow into get_key, construct, and register_key functions, leading to key class instantiation or registration",
  "anomalies": "Conditional dynamic imports within functions, which are unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic utility functions with dynamic imports for optional dependencies. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic import pattern is typical for optional dependencies and does not indicate malicious intent. The functions validate input and handle exceptions appropriately. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk~0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and risk profile.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cryptographic utility module with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The dynamic import pattern, while somewhat unconventional, is standard practice for optional dependencies and does not pose a security risk in this context. The assigned scores are appropriate and conservative, reflecting the low risk.",
