  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages cryptographic key classes and algorithms, with dynamic imports and key construction functions.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. Dynamic imports are unusual but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.2, overall low risk.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is standard for a cryptographic utility. The low security risk score aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusions are justified. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar functions for key management, with safe import practices and validation.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no malicious code, or obfuscation. Dynamic imports are typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Well-reasoned. The code is standard, and the low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Functions for key management, with dynamic imports based on algorithms.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the code appears legitimate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar key management functions, with dynamic imports.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard; no concerns.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Functions for key class retrieval and registration, with dynamic imports.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation; standard cryptographic utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports find actual malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- **Dynamic imports:** While somewhat unusual, they are used here for optional dependencies and are not malicious.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in some reports, justified by the potential for dynamic behavior, but overall low.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Keep at 0.2 for some reports, reflecting the dynamic import pattern but with low actual risk.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the evidence from all reports and the code review. The code is a standard, legitimate cryptographic utility with no signs of malicious intent.",
