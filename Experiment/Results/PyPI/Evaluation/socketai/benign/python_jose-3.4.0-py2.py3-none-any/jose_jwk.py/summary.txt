  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cryptographic utility module with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The dynamic import pattern, while somewhat unconventional, is standard practice for optional dependencies and does not pose a security risk in this context. The assigned scores are appropriate and conservative, reflecting the low risk."
