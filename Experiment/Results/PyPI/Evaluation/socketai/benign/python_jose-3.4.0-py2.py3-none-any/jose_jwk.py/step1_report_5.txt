{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions for retrieving and registering cryptographic key classes based on algorithms, and constructing key objects from key data.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'algorithm' parameter in 'get_key' and 'construct' functions, and the 'key_data' dictionary in 'construct'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include dynamic import statements within 'get_key', and the instantiation of key classes using 'key_data' and 'algorithm'.",
  "flows": "Flow involves 'construct' retrieving 'algorithm' from 'key_data' or parameter, calling 'get_key' which performs conditional imports and returns class references, then 'construct' instantiates the key class with 'key_data'.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic imports inside functions are unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code performs standard cryptographic class management.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed for managing cryptographic key classes for various algorithms. It performs dynamic imports based on algorithm needs, and constructs key objects from provided data. The imports are conditional and limited to the package scope. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. The code lacks any obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The functions serve legitimate purposes related to cryptography and key management, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard cryptographic key management module without malicious intent. It handles key class retrieval and construction securely, with no evidence of malware or security risks. The dynamic imports are controlled and purposeful. Overall, it is safe.",
