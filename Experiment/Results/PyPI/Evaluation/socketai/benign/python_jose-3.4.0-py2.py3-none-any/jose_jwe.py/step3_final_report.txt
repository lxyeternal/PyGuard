  "purpose": "Implementation of JSON Web Encryption (JWE) encryption and decryption functions, supporting multiple algorithms, with serialization, deserialization, compression, and key management.",
  "sources": "Input plaintext, encryption keys, JWE compact strings, headers, and cryptographic primitives (e.g., get_random_bytes).",
  "sinks": "Output serialized JWE strings, decrypted plaintext, and cryptographic data flows within functions.",
  "flows": "Plaintext and keys flow into cryptographic functions (_encrypt_and_auth, _decrypt_and_auth), with data serialized/deserialized via base64url encoding, and size checks prevent resource exhaustion.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code constructs, no obfuscation, and proper validation (size limits, header checks).",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard JWE procedures with appropriate validation, error handling, and security measures such as size limits to prevent decompression bombs. Usage of external cryptographic primitives appears standard. No malicious data flows, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The cryptographic practices follow best practices, and the code structure is clear and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of JWE functionality with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero. The overall assessment confirms the code's integrity and safety.",
