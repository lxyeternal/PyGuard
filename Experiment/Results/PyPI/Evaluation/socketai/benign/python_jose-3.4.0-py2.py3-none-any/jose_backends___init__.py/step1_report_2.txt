{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import cryptographic backend functions and classes from the 'jose' library, with fallbacks if certain modules are not available.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'jose.backends' package and a relative import from '.base'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "Imports from various backend modules are straightforward; no data flows or transformations are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Multiple fallback imports suggest potential version or environment compatibility handling, which is standard. No suspicious or malicious code is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs conditional imports of cryptography-related functions and classes, ensuring compatibility across different environments. No code execution, data handling, or security-sensitive operations are performed. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The structure appears typical for a library setup or compatibility layer, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility layer for importing cryptographic backend functions and classes from the 'jose' library. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a standard pattern for ensuring compatibility across different environments.",
