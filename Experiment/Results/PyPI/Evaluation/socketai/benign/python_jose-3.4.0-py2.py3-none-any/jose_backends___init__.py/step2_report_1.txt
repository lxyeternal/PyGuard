  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code consists solely of import statements with fallback mechanisms, which is standard practice for handling optional dependencies.\n- No actual cryptographic operations, data processing, or untrusted input handling are present.\n- The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n- The fallback imports are typical for ensuring compatibility across environments.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code appears clean; no issues are present in the actual code snippet.\n- The import fallback pattern is standard and safe.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n- The reports consistently state that the code is safe, with no malicious activity or security risks.\n- They mention the fallback pattern and compatibility, which are accurate.\n- No false claims or assumptions are evident.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code. No malicious behavior is detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign very low scores (0.1 or 0), which seems reasonable considering the code's nature.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- Since the code only manages imports and does not process data or perform cryptographic operations, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unjustified.\n- The malware score should remain 0 unless evidence of malicious behavior is found.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), aligning with the clear, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk present)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured dependency import pattern with fallback mechanisms. It does not pose security risks, contain malware, or exhibit obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and their scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nAll scores should remain at 0 for malware and obfuscated, with a risk score of 0, reflecting the benign nature of this code snippet.",
