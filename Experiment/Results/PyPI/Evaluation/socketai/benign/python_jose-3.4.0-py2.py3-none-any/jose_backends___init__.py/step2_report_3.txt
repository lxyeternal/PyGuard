  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Import cryptographic functions/classes with fallbacks.\n- Findings: No suspicious behavior; standard import pattern.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- Justification: The minimal securityRisk score (0.1) seems reasonable given the reliance on external dependencies, but no actual cryptographic operations or data handling are performed here. The low risk score aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, ensuring compatibility.\n- Findings: Standard fallback import pattern.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- Justification: The high confidence and zero risk/malware scores are appropriate. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Findings: Standard import fallback.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- Justification: Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Findings: Standard dependency management.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- Justification: Similar to report 1, the slight securityRisk score is justified due to dependency handling but no actual malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Findings: Standard import pattern.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- Justification: Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Malicious Behavior:** None of the reports or the code snippets indicate any malicious activity, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward import management with fallback mechanisms.\n  \n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is present; the code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** The low risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1) are justified given the benign nature of the code. The small security risk associated with dependency management is acceptable and typical.\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** The code does not process untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or perform any cryptographic operations directly. Its role is purely dependency management.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — Slight dependency management risk, but overall very low.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign dependency import pattern with fallback mechanisms to ensure compatibility. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The overall security posture based on this code snippet is very good. The minimal security risk score reflects the dependency handling nature, not any actual vulnerability.",
