  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the provided code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of import statements with multiple fallback mechanisms to ensure compatibility across different environments.\n- No actual cryptographic operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code structure is typical for a library supporting multiple backends.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- All reports conclude that the code is standard, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as import logic with fallbacks, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (low, given the nature of import setup)\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard import fallback pattern.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Also confirms standard dependency handling, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Reiterates the fallback import pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same conclusion, standard dependency import pattern.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is straightforward import logic with fallback mechanisms. No actual cryptographic processing, data handling, or dynamic code execution.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code content.\n- **Security Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), reflecting minimal concern for potential dependency issues, but no real security risk is present.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be **0**, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity, a risk score of **0.0 to 0.1** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured import fallback pattern for cryptographic backend classes/functions, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting minimal dependency management risk)\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed explanation or further analysis.",
