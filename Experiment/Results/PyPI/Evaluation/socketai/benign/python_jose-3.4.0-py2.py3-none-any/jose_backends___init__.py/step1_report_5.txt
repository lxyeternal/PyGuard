{
  "purpose": "Import backend modules and classes from the 'jose' library, providing fallbacks if certain modules are unavailable.",
  "sources": "The code reads imported modules and classes from the 'jose.backends' package and a local 'base' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to security vulnerabilities. No output or external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves conditional imports based on availability, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present. The code primarily manages imports.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import specific cryptographic backend functions and classes, providing fallback options in case of ImportError. This approach ensures compatibility across different environments but does not perform any computation or data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks, as it solely manages module imports. No external or untrusted data sources are involved, and there are no suspicious code patterns or obfuscated sections.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard conditional imports to ensure compatibility of cryptographic backends. There is no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks evident. It is a typical setup for managing optional dependencies with fallback options.",
