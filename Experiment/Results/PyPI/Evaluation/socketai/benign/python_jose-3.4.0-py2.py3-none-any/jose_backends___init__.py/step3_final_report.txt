  "purpose": "Conditional imports of cryptographic backend classes and functions with fallback mechanisms to ensure compatibility across different environments.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'jose.backends' modules, reading module availability to determine fallback options.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs are processed; the code does not contain sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Import source checks determine which backend classes/functions are imported; no data flows or untrusted data handling occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior are present; the code is straightforward dependency management.",
  "analysis": "The code performs multiple conditional imports to handle optional dependencies for cryptographic backends, with fallback options to maintain compatibility. It does not execute untrusted code, process user input, or perform cryptographic operations directly. The import pattern is standard and safe, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0-0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of this code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident, and the code's purpose is solely dependency management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard dependency import pattern with fallback mechanisms, posing no security risks or malicious threats. The scores and assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
