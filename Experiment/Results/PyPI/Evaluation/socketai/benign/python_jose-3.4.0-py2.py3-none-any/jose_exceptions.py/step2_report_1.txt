  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is solely a set of class definitions for custom exceptions related to JOSE, JWE, JWS, and JWT errors.\n   - There are no data flows, input/output operations, or processing logic.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code appears to be a standard, benign exception hierarchy for a cryptography library.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely structural (exception classes) with no malicious or security-compromising behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the straightforward class definitions and lack of suspicious content.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree on zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk, there is no justification for higher scores.\n   - The code is standard exception class hierarchy, which is common in security libraries.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly do not assume vulnerabilities; they only describe the code's structure.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are made, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable ratings are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for a JOSE/JWE/JWT library.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores reflect this reality accurately.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, safe set of exception class definitions with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent.",
