{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for JOSE, JWE, JWS, and JWT errors to handle specific error cases in a cryptography library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions of exception classes; no data input, output, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or processing; no sinks related to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only declares classes without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class hierarchy with descriptive docstrings, no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions for error handling in JOSE-related cryptography operations. No data processing, input/output, network activity, or cryptographic operations are present. The structure is standard and benign. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. The confidence score of 1 reflects certainty about the benign and straightforward nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
