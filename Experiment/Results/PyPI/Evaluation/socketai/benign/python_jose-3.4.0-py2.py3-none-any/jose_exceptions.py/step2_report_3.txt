  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports confirm that the code is solely defining exception classes for JOSE, JWE, JWS, and JWT errors.\n- No data inputs, outputs, or processing logic are present.\n- No external data sources, network operations, or file handling.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The exception hierarchy appears standard and benign.\n\n**Specific review of scores:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's nature. Exception class definitions are inherently benign.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward class definitions.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any operational or security-sensitive code.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly identify that the code is a benign exception hierarchy with no malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and reasonable.\n- No report suggests any reason to increase the risk scores.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception classes for a cryptographic library.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores are justified and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code appears safe, with no indication of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is benign, standard exception hierarchy.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**End of review.**",
