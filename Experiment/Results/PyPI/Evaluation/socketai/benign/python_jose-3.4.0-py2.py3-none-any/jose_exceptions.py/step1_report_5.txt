  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to JOSE, JWS, JWT, and JWE protocols.",
  "sources": "None; the code solely defines classes and does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data outputs, network connections, or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only establishes exception hierarchies.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class inheritance without obfuscation, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a series of custom exception class definitions for error handling in JOSE-related protocols. No external input, data processing, or network operations are present. The class hierarchy is standard, and there are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code segments. The implementation is typical for structured error management in a Python package. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines error classes without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign part of a larger JOSE/JWT/JWE handling library.",
