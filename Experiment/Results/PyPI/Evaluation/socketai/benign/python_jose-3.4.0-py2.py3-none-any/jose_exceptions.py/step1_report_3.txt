{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for JOSE, JWS, JWT, and JWE errors to handle specific error conditions in security tokens processing.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance structures, no data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks present in the code.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward class inheritance for exceptions with no unusual language features, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of custom exception classes related to JOSE, JWS, JWT, and JWE. These are standard and semantic, used for error handling within security token implementations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is simple, well-structured, and does not perform any operations beyond class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists solely of exception class definitions intended for error handling in JOSE-related processing. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign and standard for a token processing library.",
