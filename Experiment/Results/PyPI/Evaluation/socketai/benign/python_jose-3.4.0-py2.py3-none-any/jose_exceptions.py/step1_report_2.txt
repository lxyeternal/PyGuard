  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to JOSE, JWS, JWT, and JWE operations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance declarations; no data input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; only exception class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code only defines exception hierarchies without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for a JOSE-related library. No data input, no untrusted data handling, no security-sensitive operations. The classes inherit from built-in exceptions or each other in a standard way. There is no indication of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard and benign set of custom exception classes for a security library. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
