  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to JOSE, JWE, JWS, and JWT.\n   - No data processing, input/output, or cryptographic operations are present.\n   - No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and intended for error handling.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The reports correctly note the absence of suspicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree on zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and the code is purely class definitions, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The code does not perform any cryptographic operations, data handling, or network communication that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is zero across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - No malicious behavior is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they only describe the code as it is—simple class definitions.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities or potential exploits are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Overall Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for a JOSE/JWE/JWT library. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive elements. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as low or zero risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is safe.\n- No further action or concern is warranted.\n- The current scoring reflects the benign nature accurately.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
