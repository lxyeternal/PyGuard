{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for JOSE, JWE, and JWT errors related to cryptographic operations and parsing.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow; the code defines exception hierarchy without data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class inheritance for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code solely establishes custom exception classes with clear inheritance hierarchy for cryptographic and token-related errors. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing logic. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or insecure operations present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for a JOSE/JWE/JWT library, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
