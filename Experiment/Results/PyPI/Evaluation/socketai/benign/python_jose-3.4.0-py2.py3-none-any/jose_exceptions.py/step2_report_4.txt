  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes related to JOSE, JWE, JWS, and JWT errors.\n   - All classes inherit from base exception classes, with descriptive docstrings.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network operations, or cryptographic processing within this snippet.\n   - The code is purely structural, establishing error handling mechanisms.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n   - The exception classes are standard and benign, used for error handling within a larger cryptographic library.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - **Malware score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Security risk score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Risk score**: All reports assign 0 or very low (not explicitly given but implied), which is justified because the code only defines exception classes.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Logical Issues**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that this code is non-malicious, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n   - No changes are necessary to the scores; they are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since this code is purely structural and part of a larger library, the real security implications depend on how these exceptions are used elsewhere.\n   - However, based solely on this snippet, there are no security concerns.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for a JOSE/JWE/JWT library.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and justified.\n- No modifications to the scores are needed.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is safe, non-malicious, and standard for its purpose.",
