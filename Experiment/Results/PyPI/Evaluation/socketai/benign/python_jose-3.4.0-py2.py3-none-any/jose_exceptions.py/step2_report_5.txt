  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of all reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a straightforward set of custom exception classes for JOSE/JWE/JWT processing.\n- No external data sources, no data flows, no processing logic.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n- All conclude the code is benign, standard, and without malicious intent.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports.\n- Security risk scores are 0 across all reports.\n- Confidence is perfect (1) in all.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code **matches** the description: it only defines exception classes with inheritance and docstrings.\n- **No issues are present** in the code itself.\n- **No errors, flaws, or mistakes** in the report's logic or reasoning.\n- The **scores** (malware, security risk) are consistent with the code content.\n- **No assumptions** about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The exception classes are standard, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The **malware score of 0** is justified.\n- The **risk score of 0** is justified.\n- The **confidence level of 1** is appropriate, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven all the evidence, I agree with the reports' conclusions. There is **no indication of malware, obfuscation, or security risk**.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for a JOSE/JWE/JWT library. No malicious or security-threatening issues are present.",
