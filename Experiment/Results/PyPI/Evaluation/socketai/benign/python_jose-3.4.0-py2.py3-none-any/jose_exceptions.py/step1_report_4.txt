{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to JOSE, JWE, JWS, and JWT errors for a security or cryptography library",
  "sources": "Class definitions, inheritance, and docstrings; no input reading or data processing",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks or external interactions",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; just class and exception declarations",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; straightforward exception class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling related to JOSE/JWE/JWS/JWT standards. These classes inherit from base exception classes and include descriptive docstrings. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no use of environment variables, and no suspicious patterns. The code appears to be part of a larger cryptographic or security library providing structured error handling. No signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard set of exception class definitions for handling cryptographic errors. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It is safe and typical for a cryptography-focused Python library.",
