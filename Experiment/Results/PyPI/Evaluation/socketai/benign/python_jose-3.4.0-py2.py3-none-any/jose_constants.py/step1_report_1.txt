  "purpose": "Definition of cryptographic algorithms, constants, and data structures related to encryption, signing, and compression used for security operations.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, class attribute assignments, and the hashlib module import.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only defines constants and mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs. The code only provides static cryptographic algorithm identifiers and mappings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various cryptographic algorithms, constants, and related data structures for cryptography purposes. The 'hashlib' module is imported but only used within a mapping for hash functions, which is standard. There are no data input or output operations, no network communications, and no executable code beyond constant definitions. No backdoors, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a standard cryptographic utility module with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward cryptographic algorithm and constant definition module with no malicious behavior detected. It appears safe and intended for use in secure cryptographic operations.",
