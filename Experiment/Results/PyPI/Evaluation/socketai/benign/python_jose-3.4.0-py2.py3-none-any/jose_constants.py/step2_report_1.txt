  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that the code is only defining constants and mappings related to cryptographic algorithms. No data processing, external input, or malicious behavior is present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These seem appropriate given the content.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, static, and safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes that the code only defines constants and mappings without data processing or external interactions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is purely static, defining cryptographic constants, with no dynamic or external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and standard.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, no input/output or dynamic behavior; purely static definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern; only constants and static groupings, no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports agree that the code is purely defining constants and mappings. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or covert channels.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is evident; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** Since the code only defines static data, it does not pose a security risk by itself.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The only minor point is that the 'hashlib' module is imported solely for defining hash function mappings, which is standard practice.\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, external data handling, or executable code beyond constants.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall, the code appears to be a benign, static configuration module for cryptographic algorithms, with no indicators of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.**",
