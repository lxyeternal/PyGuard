  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code defines cryptographic constants, mappings, and imports `hashlib`. No data sinks, flows, anomalies, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely declarative, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the static nature of the constants and mappings, with no data processing or external interactions.\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion that this is a benign configuration module is valid.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, the code is a set of constants and mappings with no dynamic or external data handling.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior; safe to assume this is a standard cryptographic reference.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a collection of algorithm constants, with no external input or output, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears standard and benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—constants and mappings, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent or security risk evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Judgment:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports correctly identify that there is no malicious code or payload. The code is purely declarative, defining constants and mappings for cryptographic algorithms.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** Since the code only defines constants, there is no active behavior that could introduce security risks. The use of `hashlib` is standard and limited to hash function references.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — static constants with no dynamic or external dependencies.\n\n**Final note:** Given the absence of any suspicious or malicious elements, and the fact that this code is a typical constants module for cryptography, I concur with the assessments in the reports.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, static configuration module defining cryptographic algorithms and related constants.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned (all zero) are appropriate and should remain as such.\n\n**Conclusion:** I agree with the reports' assessments. No changes needed.",
