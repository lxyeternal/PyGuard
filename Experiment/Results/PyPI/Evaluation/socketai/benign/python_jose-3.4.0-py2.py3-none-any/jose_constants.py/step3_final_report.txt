{
  "purpose": "This code defines cryptographic algorithm constants, groupings, and hash function mappings for use in cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; purely static constants and mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static definitions with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports hashlib solely for defining hash function mappings. It declares classes with constants representing various cryptographic algorithms, groupings, and sets for supported algorithms. No dynamic code, input/output, or executable logic is present. The structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code appears to serve as a configuration or reference module for cryptographic operations, which is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, benign configuration module defining cryptographic algorithm constants and mappings. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
