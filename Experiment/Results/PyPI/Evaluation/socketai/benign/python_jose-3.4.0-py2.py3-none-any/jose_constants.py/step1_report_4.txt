{
  "purpose": "Defines cryptographic algorithms, constants, and mappings for use in a cryptography-related package or application.",
  "sources": "No external data input; all data are hardcoded constants and mappings within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs/inputs from untrusted sources; code only defines constants and mappings.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. All algorithms and constants are standard and well-known.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a collection of cryptographic algorithm names, constants, and mappings to hashlib functions. It includes various encryption, hashing, and key wrapping algorithms. No dynamic code execution, external input handling, or data transmission is present. The code appears to be a standard configuration or constants module for cryptography, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static definitions module for cryptographic algorithms and constants. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears safe and standard, serving as a reference for cryptographic operations.",
