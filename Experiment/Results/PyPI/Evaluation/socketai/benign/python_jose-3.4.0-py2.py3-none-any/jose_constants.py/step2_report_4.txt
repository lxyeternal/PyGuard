  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is purely defining constants, algorithm identifiers, and mappings related to cryptography.\n   - There are no data sinks, external data processing, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The only imported module is `hashlib`, used solely for mapping algorithm names to hash functions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, with no logical flaws or misinterpretations.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is static and benign, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the content.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any risk that warrants a higher score.\n   - The code is purely declarative, with no runtime or external interactions.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n   - No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made that are based on unfounded assumptions.\n   - All assessments are consistent with the code's static nature.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores align well with the code's characteristics.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional Expert Estimate:**\n\nGiven the complete lack of dynamic behavior, data handling, or external interactions, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard constants module for cryptographic algorithms.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Score | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0            | No malicious activity or payloads detected.                |\n| Obfuscated         | 0            | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation observed.          |\n| Security Risk      | 0            | Static definitions with no external or runtime influence. |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is safe, benign, and suitable for its intended purpose as a cryptographic constants definition module. No further action or concern is warranted.",
