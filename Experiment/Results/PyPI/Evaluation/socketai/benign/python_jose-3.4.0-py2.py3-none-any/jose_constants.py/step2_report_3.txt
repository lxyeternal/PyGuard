  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is purely defining constants, algorithm names, and static mappings.\n   - No data processing, external input/output, or executable logic is present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are detected.\n   - The use of `hashlib` is standard and only used for mapping hash functions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the static, well-understood nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - The only potential concern would be if these constants are misused elsewhere, but based solely on this code, there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n   - The reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about external behavior.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No report suggests any suspicious or malicious activity that warrants a higher risk or malware score.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks evident; static definitions only.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a standard, static configuration module defining cryptographic algorithm constants and mappings. It is safe, non-obfuscated, and contains no malware or security risks.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- Maintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- No further action needed unless future code integrates these constants into dynamic or external contexts.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code appears benign and safe for use within cryptographic libraries.",
