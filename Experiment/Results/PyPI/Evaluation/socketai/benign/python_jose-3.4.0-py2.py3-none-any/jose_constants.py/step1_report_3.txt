  "purpose": "Definition and categorization of cryptographic algorithms, encryption schemes, and related constants for use in a cryptographic library or application.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code solely defines constants and mappings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code establishes static mappings and constants only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures detected. The code is purely declarative, defining algorithm identifiers and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive set of algorithm identifiers, categories, and mappings related to cryptographic operations. It uses standard library hashlib for hash functions and defines several algorithm sets and unions. There is no evidence of input processing, external communication, or dynamic execution. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard, static configuration of cryptographic algorithms. No obfuscation or malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration module defining constants and mappings for cryptographic algorithms. It poses no security threats, malware, or malicious behavior. It appears safe and intended for use within a cryptographic context.",
