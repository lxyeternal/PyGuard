  "purpose": "Definition of cryptographic algorithms, constants, and related mappings for use in a security or encryption library.",
  "sources": "Constants within the Algorithms and Zips classes, including algorithm names, hash functions, and supported values.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no processing of untrusted data, input, or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines constants and mappings without dynamic or data-processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code; the code strictly defines algorithm constants and static mappings. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of algorithm names, categorization, and hash function mappings for cryptographic purposes. It only establishes constants and static sets, which are standard in cryptographic libraries. No input handling, data processing, or network operations are present. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign configuration or constants module for cryptographic algorithms. It does not contain malicious code or behaviors. It is safe based on the provided content.",
