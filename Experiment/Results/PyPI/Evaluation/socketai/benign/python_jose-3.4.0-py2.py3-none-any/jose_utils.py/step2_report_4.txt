  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details, scores, and potential implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for cryptography, encoding, decoding, and key format detection. No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, high confidence (0.9). Malware score: 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are standard, rely on external libraries, and perform typical cryptographic tasks. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion and malware score are reasonable. The security risk score (0.2) might be slightly high given the benign nature, but considering the utility scope, it's acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions for encoding, decoding, hashing, and format detection. No suspicious behaviors, standard practices, high confidence (0.9). Malware score: 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard cryptographic helpers, no malicious logic. The functions are typical of cryptography libraries.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment and scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for token processing, format detection, and encoding/decoding. No malicious behavior, standard practices, high confidence (0.9). Malware score: 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions handle untrusted data safely, with no network or system commands involved. The logic is straightforward and standard.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion and malware score are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Cryptographic utility functions, format detection, safe data handling, high confidence (0.9). Malware score: 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation. The functions are typical for cryptography support code.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The scores and reasoning are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, no malicious behavior, high confidence (0.9). Malware score: 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** Standard cryptographic utilities, no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 across reports, reflecting low security risk. Given the functions are utility-based and do not perform dangerous operations, this is reasonable.\n\n### My Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal risk, primarily due to cryptographic utility functions, which are standard.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, and the code appears to be a standard cryptographic utility library with no malicious intent or supply chain concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1  \n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis.",
