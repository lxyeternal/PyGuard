  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The functions are standard cryptographic utilities, handling encoding, decoding, hash calculation, and key format detection.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears benign, well-structured, and aligned with typical cryptographic practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues detected. The low security risk score aligns with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar utility functions, safe handling of data, no network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard cryptographic utility functions, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Again, benign, with very low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Utility functions for token handling, key detection, and encoding.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard cryptographic helpers, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; very low security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar cryptographic utility functions, safe data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, benign cryptographic utilities.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues, very low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Utility functions for encoding, decoding, and key format detection.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical cryptographic utility functions, no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Benign, standard code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is purely utility functions for cryptography and encoding.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, consistent with the benign nature of utility functions.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0.0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Keep at 0.0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the lack of any suspicious behavior, I would reduce the overall security risk to **0.0 or 0.1** to reflect minimal concern.\n\n**Note:** The current scores are reasonable, but I would suggest lowering the risk scores slightly to 0.0 or 0.1, considering the absence of any suspicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a standard cryptographic utility library with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The current scores are appropriate, but I recommend minimal risk levels (0.0 or 0.1) for a more accurate reflection of its benign nature.",
