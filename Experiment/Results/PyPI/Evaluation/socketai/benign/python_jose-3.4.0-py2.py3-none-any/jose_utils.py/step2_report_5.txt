  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their accuracy, consistency, and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as utility functions for cryptography, encoding, decoding, and key format detection.\n- They uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, and obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no suspicion of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Code Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code matches the description; no discrepancies are observed.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are evident.\n- **Dependency handling:** The fallback for `long_to_bytes` is correctly implemented.\n- **Functionality:** All functions perform standard cryptographic or encoding tasks, aligned with their descriptions.\n- **Potential concerns:** No signs of data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious control flow.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Scores:** The malware scores of 0 are justified given the benign description.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly higher for some reports (0.2), which seems reasonable given the functions' cryptographic nature but no evident vulnerabilities.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The reports' assessments seem accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are reasonable; no adjustments are necessary.\n- The detailed reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, due to cryptographic utility functions but no vulnerabilities)\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard cryptographic utility library with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The provided reports are accurate and reasonable in their scoring.",
