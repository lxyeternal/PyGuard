{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding, decoding, cryptographic operations, and PEM/SSH key format detection, likely used in security or cryptography-related applications.",
  "sources": "Input data from function arguments such as access_token, hash_alg, and string inputs; external modules like base64, re, struct; environment variables are not used.",
  "sinks": "Data transformations such as encoding/decoding (base64, utf-8), cryptographic hash calculations, and data parsing, which do not directly lead to data leakage or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input strings or bytes pass through encoding/decoding functions; cryptographic hashes are computed from tokens; data is transformed between formats, but there are no evident source-to-sink malicious data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code performs standard cryptography-related utility functions, including PEM/SSH key format detection. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for encoding, decoding, cryptographic hash calculation, and format detection for PEM and SSH keys. It performs standard cryptographic operations such as base64 encoding/decoding, conversion between integers and bytes, and hash-based token validation. No signs of malicious behavior like network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The functions are typical of security-related libraries. The code is well-structured, using safe cryptographic practices, and does not execute external code or contain suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of utility functions related to cryptography, encoding, and format validation. No malicious or sabotage behavior detected. The code is standard for security or cryptography applications, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
