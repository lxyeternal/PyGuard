    "Use of cryptographic functions and regex patterns is standard, but code relies on external cryptography libraries",

  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for cryptographic data manipulation, encoding, decoding, and key format detection. Functions such as long_to_bytes adapt depending on available libraries, and base64 encoding/decoding includes handling for URL-safe variants. The calculate_at_hash function implements standard hashing per OpenID Connect specifications. Key format detection functions use regex to identify PEM and SSH key types, which is typical. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All functions perform standard cryptography-related tasks, and no suspicious data flows or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a collection of utility functions for cryptographic encoding, decoding, and key format detection. It does not contain malicious behavior or malicious data flows. The implementation is standard and aligned with typical cryptographic practices. No indicators of malicious intent or supply chain attacks are observed.",
