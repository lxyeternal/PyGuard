  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of cryptographic utility functions with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by its utility nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9)."
