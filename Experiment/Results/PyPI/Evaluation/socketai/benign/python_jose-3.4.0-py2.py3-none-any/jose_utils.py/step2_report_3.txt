  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for cryptography, encoding, decoding, key format detection. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is standard cryptographic utility code with no signs of malicious activity. The functions are straightforward, using standard libraries, and perform typical tasks. The low risk score (0.2) aligns with the benign nature.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1—utility functions for encoding, decoding, cryptography, and format detection. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature. The risk score is even lower here, which is reasonable given the benign functions.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for token handling, key format detection, safe processing of cryptographic data. No malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly states that the code is standard cryptographic support code with no signs of malicious intent. The risk score is appropriate.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Cryptographic utility functions, format detection, safe data handling, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9  \n- **Assessment:** The evaluation is consistent with the code's content. The low risk and malware scores are justified.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for cryptography, format detection, safe handling, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9  \n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusions are consistent with the code. The low risk and malware scores are appropriate.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the benign utility nature of the code. These are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (a slightly higher but still low score, reflecting the utility nature but acknowledging the cryptographic functions involved)\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are present. The scores are appropriate, and the detailed reasoning aligns with the code's content.\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign an overall score based on my analysis, I would agree with the existing scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.",
