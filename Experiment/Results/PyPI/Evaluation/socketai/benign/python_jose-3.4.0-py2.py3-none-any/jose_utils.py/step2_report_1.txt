  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the reported issues with the code, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for cryptographic encoding, decoding, key format detection. No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is standard cryptographic utility code. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The risk score is low, justified by the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. The scores and analysis are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe handling of cryptographic data, format detection, and standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the benign nature. The very low risk score aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focused on encoding, decoding, token handling, format detection, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, no network or system modification, standard cryptographic practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious signs.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for cryptography, format detection, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The code contains no malicious payloads, no network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, ranging from 0.1 to 0.2, justified by the benign utility functions.\n\n### Additional Observations:\n\n- The functions handle cryptographic data safely, with fallback mechanisms for dependencies.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No suspicious control flow or obfuscation.\n- The regex patterns and key format detection are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n- The `calculate_at_hash` function correctly implements a standard hash truncation per OpenID Connect specs.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware, Obfuscated, Risk Scores:** Based on the review, I agree with the provided scores. They are consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Potential Adjustments:** None necessary; the assessments are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a set of cryptographic utility functions, standard in security libraries, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are justified and align with the analysis.\n\n**My final estimate:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with reports)  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's benign nature and appropriate scoring.",
