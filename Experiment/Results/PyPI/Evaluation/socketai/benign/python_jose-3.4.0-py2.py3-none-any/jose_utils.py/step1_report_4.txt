  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding, decoding, cryptographic transformations, and key format detection in security-related contexts.",
  "sources": "Input is received via function arguments such as access_token, data, or strings from external sources; some functions handle encoded data from base64 or user input.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include base64 encoding/decoding, hashing, and cryptographic key format validation. No direct network or file system operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data is transformed from input (e.g., access tokens, base64 strings) through hashing or encoding functions, with no external or untrusted data flow to system or network layers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; the functions serve standard cryptographic and encoding purposes. The base64 and key format detection functions are standard utility functions. No suspicious logic or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides cryptographic utility functions, encoding/decoding helpers, and key format validation routines. The functions handle input data for encoding, decoding, hashing, and format detection without performing any network, file, or system modifications. The code relies on standard libraries and straightforward logic. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage, are detected. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard set of cryptographic and encoding utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Overall security risk is very low.",
