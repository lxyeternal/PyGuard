{
  "purpose": "Standard JWT signing, verification, and decoding functions using the 'jose' library, implementing cryptographic operations for token handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as payload, key, token, headers, and algorithms; data read during token parsing and key processing.",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic signing and verification functions; decoding of JWT components; exception handling pathways.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into encoding, signing, or verification functions; cryptographic operations process the data; results are returned or exceptions raised.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity; standard cryptographic practices observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard JWT operations using the 'jose' library, with proper handling of various key formats and algorithms. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. Exception handling is appropriate, and the code is readable and straightforward. The cryptographic functions are implemented securely, assuming proper use. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's nature and potential for misuse if misconfigured, but do not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of JWT signing and verification, showing no signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious intent. The low security risk score is justified given its cryptographic purpose. No modifications or further security concerns are warranted based on this review.",
