  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements JWT signing, verification, and decoding functions using the 'jose' library.\n- Handles various key formats, supports multiple algorithms.\n- Uses standard cryptographic practices, with exception handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The code is consistent with typical JWT handling libraries.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code appears correct and aligns with standard practices.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.\n- No external network or system commands involved.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The code relies heavily on external 'jose' library functions, which are assumed secure.\n- The `_load()` function encodes the JWT string if it's a str, which is standard.\n- Exception handling is appropriate, but the code does not sanitize or log errors, which could be a concern in some environments but not malicious.\n- The key handling functions (`_get_keys()`) are flexible but could be exploited if malicious keys are supplied—though this is expected for cryptographic libraries.\n\n### Review of the scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. Given the code's nature, this seems appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Low (~0.2), which aligns with the fact that this is cryptographic code that could be misused if misconfigured but is not inherently risky.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign scores > 0.5; they all are low (0.2), which is justified.\n- The code does not perform any dangerous actions beyond cryptographic operations, which are standard.\n\n### Potential issues based on assumptions:\n- If untrusted data is used improperly, cryptographic failures could occur, but this is expected.\n- The code does not perform input validation beyond decoding, but that is typical for such libraries.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, obfuscation, or high security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, typical for cryptographic libraries)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe code is a standard JWT utility, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The low security risk score is appropriate, considering the context.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate; the code is legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified. No changes needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The supply chain security risk for this code is minimal; it is a standard JWT handling library with no evidence of malicious activity.",
