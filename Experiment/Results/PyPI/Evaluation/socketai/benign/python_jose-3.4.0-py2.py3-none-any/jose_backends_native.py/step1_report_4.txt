{
  "purpose": "Implement HMAC-based cryptographic signing and verification using specified hash algorithms, supporting key processing from various formats including JWK.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'key' parameter during initialization, and from the 'msg' and 'sig' parameters during sign and verify methods.",
  "sinks": "The 'hmac.new()' function uses the prepared key and message to generate signatures, and 'hmac.compare_digest()' compares signatures. The 'base64url_encode()' and 'base64url_decode()' functions handle encoding/decoding of keys.",
  "flows": "The 'key' input flows into key processing steps, possibly through JWK or raw string/bytes, then into HMAC signing. Message data flows from 'msg' into 'sign' and 'verify' functions, with signatures compared for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code properly handles key validation, encoding, and cryptographic operations. The check for asymmetric keys to prevent misuse as HMAC secrets is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cryptographic practices for HMAC signing and verification, validating key types and encoding. It does not include any suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious data leaks. The functions rely on secure, standard libraries and correctly handle key formats and encodings. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The security measures, such as key validation and digest comparison, are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a well-implemented cryptographic utility for HMAC signing and verification with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It processes input securely and performs standard cryptographic operations as intended.",
