  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-implemented cryptographic utility for HMAC operations. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain issues are evident. The security and malware scores are justified as zero, with a very low risk score (~0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the implementation."
