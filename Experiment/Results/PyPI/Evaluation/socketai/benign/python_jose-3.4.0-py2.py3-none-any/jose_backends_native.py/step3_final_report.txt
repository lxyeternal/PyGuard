{
  "purpose": "Implement HMAC signing and verification with support for multiple hash algorithms, handling keys from raw bytes, strings, or JWK format.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for key initialization, key data in JWK 'k' field, key encoding functions.",
  "sinks": "HMAC digest computation, key serialization via base64url encoding.",
  "flows": "Input key data (raw or JWK) -> validation and decoding -> stored as prepared_key -> used in sign() and verify() functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and performs expected cryptographic operations without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly validates key types, prevents asymmetric keys from being used as HMAC secrets, and securely handles key encoding/decoding. It employs os.urandom() for randomness, which is appropriate. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The signing and verification functions use standard hmac and hashlib libraries, with proper digest comparison. Validation steps are thorough, and the overall structure is clear and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-implemented cryptographic utility for HMAC operations. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain issues are evident. The security and malware scores are justified as zero, with a very low risk score (~0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the implementation.",
