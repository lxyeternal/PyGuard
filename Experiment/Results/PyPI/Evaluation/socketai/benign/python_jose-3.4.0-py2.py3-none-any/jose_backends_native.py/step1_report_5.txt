{
  "purpose": "Implement HMAC-based key management for signing and verification using various hash algorithms.",
  "sources": "os.urandom for generating random bytes; input parameters 'key' and 'algorithm' for HMAC setup; jwk_dict for key processing.",
  "sinks": "hmac.new for signing; hmac.compare_digest for verification; base64url_encode for key serialization.",
  "flows": "get_random_bytes generates secure random data; constructor processes key input; sign creates HMAC digest; verify compares signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data; use of standard libraries and functions; no unusual or obfuscated code; key processing appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a secure method for HMAC signing and verification, with proper handling of key formats and algorithms. Random bytes generation uses os.urandom, a cryptographically secure method. Key processing includes base64url decoding and type validation. No malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code relies on well-established cryptographic practices and libraries, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malware. The key serialization is done via base64url encoding, which is typical. Overall, the code appears to serve its intended purpose securely and transparently.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of HMAC key handling and signing/verification without any malicious behavior or security risks. It adheres to best practices and does not contain suspicious or malicious code segments.",
