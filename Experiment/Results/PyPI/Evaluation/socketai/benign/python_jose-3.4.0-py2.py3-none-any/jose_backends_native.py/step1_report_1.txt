{
  "purpose": "Implement HMAC-based signing and verification using specified hash algorithms, supporting key processing from various formats.",
  "sources": "os.urandom for random bytes, key input during class initialization, and potentially external JWK data via get method.",
  "sinks": "hmac.new for signing, hmac.compare_digest for verification, base64url_decode and encode for key handling.",
  "flows": "Input key (raw or JWK) -> process key (possibly decoding) -> sign/verify data with HMAC -> encode/decode keys as needed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.urandom is standard, no suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks identified. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for HMAC signing and verification using secure hashing algorithms. It properly processes keys from various formats, including JWKs, and performs cryptographic operations using Python's standard library and established libraries. The key processing, including decoding and validation, appears standard and safe. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. Random number generation is from os.urandom, which is appropriate. The functions are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The imports and code structure do not suggest malicious intent or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard cryptographic operations securely, with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It appears to be a legitimate implementation of HMAC signing and verification.",
