{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and rules for linting git commit messages, such as enforcing line length, whitespace, and content rules to ensure commit message standards.",
  "sources": "Reading commit message content (title, body, changed files), commit metadata (author email, author name), and user-defined options via configuration.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data sources include commit message content, author email, author name, changed file list, and user-provided regex patterns and options.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data (e.g., commit message, author info, changed files, regex patterns) flow from sources into validation methods and rule application logic, influencing rule violation creation and configuration modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors, are present. The code relies on standard Python modules, uses regex for validation, and has no network activity or system manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs validation of commit message content and metadata using regex and string checks, and modifies configuration based on matching patterns. It also employs logging for debugging and warnings. No malicious behavior, such as network access, data exfiltration, or system compromise, is evident. The use of regex and string matching is typical for linting tools. All inputs are from commit data or user options, and no unsafe operations are performed. The structure and purpose align with standard code quality enforcement, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of git commit message linting rules with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely checks commit content against user-configurable rules, with proper logging and error handling. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or exploits are detected.",
