{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of classes and rules for analyzing git commit messages for style and quality violations, including configurable options for various commit message aspects.",
  "sources": "Input sources include commit message content (title, body), author email, author name, and changed files from commit objects, accessed via properties and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur if commit data (such as author info or message content) were mishandled or sent over the network, but there are no explicit network or file write operations. Logging functions output data, but are standard.",
  "flows": "Data flows from commit objects and their properties (title, body, author email/name, changed files) into validation functions and conditional checks, resulting in rule violation reports or rule application effects. No external or system command execution observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected. The code uses regex for validation, which is standard. Logging configurations are minimal and appear benign. No backdoors or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a rule-based system for commit message validation, including regex-based matching and length/format checks. All data sources are commit message fields or author info, with no external input streams. There are no network operations, file system manipulations, or subprocess calls. The use of logging is standard for debugging. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of style validation rules, with no malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard, rule-based validation framework for commit messages, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs pattern matching, length checks, and applies configurable rules without engaging in any harmful or unauthorized actions.",
