  "purpose": "Defines configurable rule options for a Git linting tool, including validation and type handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements: os, re, and external modules; class and function definitions; decorators and data class initializations.",
  "sinks": "os.path.isdir, os.path.isfile, os.path.realpath, re.compile, and raising exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input data from constructor arguments or method calls flows into validation (e.g., os.path checks, regex compilation), which then sets internal state or raises exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code; no hardcoded credentials, no network operations, or hidden behaviors. Use of os.path functions to verify file/directory existence is standard. Regex compilation is for validation purposes only. Exception handling is standard and does not leak data.",
  "analysis": "The code implements various classes for handling rule options with validation logic, such as string, integer, boolean, list, path, and regex options. Decorators are used for null handling. Validation involves filesystem checks, regex compilation, and type conversions. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. All external library usage appears legitimate and limited to standard validation procedures. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of configuration options for a linting tool, with proper validation and error handling. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
