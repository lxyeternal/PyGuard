{
  "purpose": "To import the 'metadata' module based on Python version and retrieve the version of the 'gitlint-core' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version from sys.version_info and calls metadata.version('gitlint-core') to get package version info.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the call to metadata.version(), which accesses package metadata. No untrusted input handling is evident.",
  "flows": "The flow is: check Python version -> import appropriate metadata module -> retrieve package version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The code conditionally imports modules based on version and retrieves package version info.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard Python version check to import 'metadata' from the correct location, then retrieves the version of a package. This is typical behavior for managing compatibility across Python versions. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data exfiltration. The use of 'sys' and 'importlib_metadata' is standard. No external data is read from untrusted sources beyond package metadata, which is not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility snippet for retrieving a package version. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It appears safe and purposeful.",
