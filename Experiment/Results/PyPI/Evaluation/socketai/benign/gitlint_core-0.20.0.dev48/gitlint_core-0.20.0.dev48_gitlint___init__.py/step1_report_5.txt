{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves the version information of the 'gitlint-core' package using the importlib.metadata API, with compatibility for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.version_info, and metadata.version() function call",
  "sinks": "Potential use of the version string returned by metadata.version()",
  "flows": "importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata (based on Python version) -> metadata.version() -> __version__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. The code uses standard libraries for version retrieval, which is typical and expected.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by checking the Python version to determine the appropriate import method for retrieving package metadata. For Python 3.8 and above, it imports from importlib.metadata; for earlier versions, it imports from the backport package importlib_metadata. It then assigns the version of 'gitlint-core' to __version__ using metadata.version(). This process is standard and does not contain obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behavior. No external data is sent over the network, no hardcoded secrets are present, and the code simply retrieves package version info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for obtaining package version information with compatibility across Python versions. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
