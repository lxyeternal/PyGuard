  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'gitlint-core' package in a Python environment, ensuring compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reading Python version info via sys.version_info; importing 'metadata' module conditionally; calling 'metadata.version(\"gitlint-core\")'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks, network activity, or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Python version check -> conditional import of 'metadata' -> retrieval of package version via 'metadata.version()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard compatibility check for Python versions >= 3.8, importing 'importlib.metadata' or its backport 'importlib_metadata' accordingly, then retrieves the version of 'gitlint-core'. It uses well-known libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leaks. The code is straightforward, with clear intent, and does not process untrusted input or perform network operations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility pattern for package version retrieval. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
