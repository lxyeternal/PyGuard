{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'gitlint-core' package using the appropriate import method based on Python version.",
  "sources": "The import statements for 'sys' and 'metadata' (from importlib or importlib_metadata). The call to 'metadata.version(\"gitlint-core\")'.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'metadata.version' could potentially expose version info, but is generally safe. No untrusted input sources or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'metadata' based on Python version -> call to 'metadata.version(\"gitlint-core\")' retrieves package version info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The code simply performs a version check and imports accordingly.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python version to decide whether to import 'metadata' from 'importlib' (Python 3.8+) or from 'importlib_metadata' for earlier versions. Then it retrieves the version of 'gitlint-core' package. The logic is standard for compatibility and does not include any malicious or suspicious behavior. No user input, untrusted sources, or side effects are involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, standard implementation to obtain package version info with compatibility handling. No malicious intent or security issues detected.",
