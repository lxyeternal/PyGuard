  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll reports describe the same core logic: checking Python version, importing the appropriate 'metadata' module, and retrieving the version of 'gitlint-core'. The analysis across reports consistently concludes that the code is standard, benign, and poses no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n- The code functions as intended: it conditionally imports modules based on Python version and retrieves package version info.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The code does not process untrusted input or perform any network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify that the code is a compatibility pattern, with no malicious intent.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n- **Conclusion:** The reports are sound and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Since there's no malicious or suspicious activity, these scores are appropriate.\n- **Suggestion:** No change needed; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**\n- The risk scores are all 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n- No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware Score Considerations**\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score is appropriately assigned.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n- All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's actual behavior.\n- They correctly interpret the purpose and flow of the code.\n- No unwarranted claims are made.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report Content**\n- The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n- No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment & Personal Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a common compatibility pattern.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security issues.\n- The purpose is solely to retrieve package version info in a safe manner.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\nThe code is safe, standard, and correctly scored across all reports. The detailed reasoning confirms that there are no security concerns.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Maintain malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n- No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future code that might incorporate malicious payloads or obfuscation, but this particular snippet is benign.",
