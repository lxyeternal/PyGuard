  "purpose": "Utility class for conditional output printing based on verbosity levels and stream selection (stdout/stderr).",
  "sources": "Configuration object 'config' providing verbosity level; method parameters for message, verbosity, exact match, and stream.",
  "sinks": "Stream write methods (stream.write) that output messages based on verbosity and configuration.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (message, verbosity, exact, stream) flow into '_output', which conditionally writes to stream depending on 'config.verbosity'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard library functions and well-known classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility class for output management based on verbosity settings. It uses the 'LintConfig' object to determine if messages should be printed, either exactly matching the verbosity level or exceeding it. The output streams are stdout and stderr. No data is read from untrusted sources, no untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for controlled logging/output based on verbosity levels. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies identified. The implementation uses standard patterns and libraries, with no signs of malicious intent.",
