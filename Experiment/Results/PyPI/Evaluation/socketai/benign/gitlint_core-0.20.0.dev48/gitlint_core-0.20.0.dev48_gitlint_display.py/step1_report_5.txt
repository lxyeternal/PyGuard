  "purpose": "Utility class for conditional printing messages to output streams based on verbosity settings.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; uses configuration object 'config' for verbosity levels.",
  "sinks": "Outputs messages to stdout or stderr streams.",
  "flows": "Method calls to '_output' with message and verbosity, leading to writing to stdout or stderr streams.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'Display' that prints messages depending on verbosity levels set in 'LintConfig'. It uses standard Python streams (stdout and stderr) and conditional logic to control message output. No untrusted input handling, no dynamic code execution, no external data sources or sinks that could be malicious. The code is a simple utility without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for logging output with verbosity control. No malicious intent or malicious behavior is detected. It functions as a standard, safe logging helper.",
