  "purpose": "Utility class for conditional printing of messages to output streams based on verbosity levels and configuration",
  "sources": "Input data from external configuration (LintConfig) and method parameters",
  "sinks": "Writing messages to stdout or stderr streams",
  "flows": "Configuration's verbosity level influences output; message and verbosity parameters determine output flow to streams",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected; no data leakage or malicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility class Display that manages message output based on verbosity settings from a configuration object. It uses standard input/output streams (stdout/stderr) for displaying messages. The logic compares verbosity levels and writes messages accordingly. No external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated parts, and no suspicious activities are present. The code appears to be straightforward, focusing solely on message logging based on verbosity flags.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for output control with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages logging output depending on configuration settings.",
