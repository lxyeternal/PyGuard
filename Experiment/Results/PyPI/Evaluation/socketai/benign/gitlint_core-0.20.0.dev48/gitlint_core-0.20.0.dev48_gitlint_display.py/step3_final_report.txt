  "purpose": "Utility class to print messages to output streams (stdout/stderr) based on verbosity levels from a configuration object.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from 'LintConfig' for verbosity; writes messages to 'stdout' or 'stderr' streams.",
  "sinks": "Output streams (stdout, stderr) where messages are written; no untrusted data sources involved.",
  "flows": "Configuration verbosity level determines if messages are written; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, transparent utility class managing message output based on verbosity levels. It uses standard Python modules and a configuration object. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is benign, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging utility with no malicious or security concerns. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
