  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward utility class (`Display`) for printing messages based on verbosity levels.\n- They uniformly state that the code uses standard library functions (`stream.write()`) and a configuration object (`LintConfig`) to control output.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The logic is simple: compare verbosity levels and output messages accordingly.\n- No external data sources, dynamic code execution, or network activity is involved.\n\n**Review of the code against the reports:**\n- The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n- The `Display` class and its methods are standard for logging or verbose output control.\n- No vulnerabilities or security risks are apparent.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward implementation.\n- **Risk score:** All reports give 0, which is appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- No changes needed in the scoring or reasoning.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a safe, standard utility with no security concerns.\n- The high confidence scores (mostly 1) are justified.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n**My final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's actual behavior.",
