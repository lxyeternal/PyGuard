  "purpose": "Utility class for printing messages to stdout or stderr based on verbosity settings from a configuration object.",
  "sources": "The code reads the configuration object 'config' to determine verbosity levels; reads messages passed to methods.",
  "sinks": "Writing messages to stdout or stderr streams using stream.write().",
  "flows": "Input: 'message' parameter and 'config' object; Output: messages written to stdout/stderr streams if verbosity conditions are met.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious or obfuscated code, no network activity, and no data leaks. Usage is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for outputting messages based on verbosity levels. It uses the 'sys' streams for output and relies on a configuration object for control. There are no external data sources, no dangerous code flows, and no hidden or malicious logic. The functions perform simple checks and write to streams; no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for printing messages according to verbosity settings. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It appears to be a safe, standard implementation.",
