  "purpose": "Utility class for printing messages to output streams based on verbosity settings",
  "sources": "The class reads the 'config.verbosity' attribute from the LintConfig object",
  "sinks": "Writing messages to stdout or stderr streams using stream.write()",
  "flows": "The method _output checks verbosity levels and then writes messages to streams based on conditions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Display class with methods to print messages to stdout or stderr depending on verbosity levels specified in a config object. The _output method compares the config's verbosity with the desired level and outputs accordingly. The class is purely for logging purposes, with no external inputs or data flows that could introduce security risks. No data leaks, injection, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for message output based on verbosity, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues.",
