  "purpose": "Manage deprecation warnings related to regex method usage, providing warnings once and returning appropriate regex functions based on configuration.",
  "sources": "Configuration object 'cls.config.regex_style_search', rule objects providing 'id', 'name', and 'regex_option', and the 'regex_option.value' methods.",
  "sinks": "Logging warnings via the 'logging' module; returning regex methods ('match' or 'search') from 'regex_option.value'.",
  "flows": "Checks configuration; if deprecated 'match' is used, logs a warning once; then returns the 'match' method; otherwise, returns 'search'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious code; standard warning handling and method returning logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton class 'Deprecation' that manages regex method deprecation warnings. It reads configuration to determine whether to use 'search' or 'match' methods, logs a warning once per message to avoid duplicates, and returns the appropriate method. No external data, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The warning message is constructed dynamically and logged, which could expose information if logs are insecure, but this is standard practice. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The warning logging is a typical pattern, and the method return logic is safe. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.1) are justified, considering the minimal risk associated with log exposure, which is manageable with proper log security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe deprecation warning handler with no malicious or security vulnerabilities. The scoring in the reports is appropriate; the minimal risk score reflects potential log exposure, which is common and not inherently dangerous.",
