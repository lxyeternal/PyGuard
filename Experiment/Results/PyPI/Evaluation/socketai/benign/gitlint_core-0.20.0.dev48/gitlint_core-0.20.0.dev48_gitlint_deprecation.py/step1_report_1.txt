{
  "purpose": "The code defines a singleton class 'Deprecation' to handle deprecation warnings related to regex method usage in a logging system, and manages warning messages to prevent duplicates.",
  "sources": "The class reads configuration data from 'cls.config.regex_style_search', and rule objects with 'id', 'name', and 'regex_option' attributes. It also reads from the logging system.",
  "sinks": "The code returns either 'regex_option.value.search' or 'regex_option.value.match' functions, which could be used elsewhere in regex matching operations. No direct data sinks or external data transmission is present.",
  "flows": "The function 'get_regex_method' reads configuration, logs warnings if necessary, and returns a regex method ('match' or 'search') based on config and rule parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. No suspicious network or system activity is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages deprecation warnings related to regex method semantics. It uses class variables to store config state and previously logged warnings to avoid repetition. The warning message is generated dynamically and logged once per unique message. The code relies on external configuration ('cls.config') and rule objects, but does not perform any unsafe operations or data leaks. There is no malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deprecation warning handler with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It merely manages warnings about regex method changes and logs them appropriately.",
