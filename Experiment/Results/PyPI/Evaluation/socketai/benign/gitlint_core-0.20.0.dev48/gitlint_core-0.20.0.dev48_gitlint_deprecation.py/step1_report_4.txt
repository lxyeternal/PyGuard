{
  "purpose": "The code manages deprecation warnings and behavior for regex handling in a Git linting tool, specifically switching between 'match' and 'search' methods for regex patterns.",
  "sources": "Input is read from the rule objects (rule.id and rule.name) and configuration (config.regex_style_search). Warnings are logged via the logging module.",
  "sinks": "Logging warnings potentially leaks information if logs are exposed, but no other data sinks or external data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "When get_regex_method is called, depending on config.regex_style_search, it returns either search or match method from regex_option.value, with a warning logged if switching from match to search.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Use of class variables and dynamic method selection is standard for configuration handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton class handling deprecation warnings related to regex method changes. It checks configuration flags to determine whether to use 'search' or 'match' and logs warnings only once per message. No external inputs are processed directly, and all data flow is internal to configuration and rule metadata. There is no malicious or suspicious activity, and no code injection or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration and warning management component with no malicious intent or security risks. It only logs warnings about regex method deprecation and does not perform any harmful actions.",
