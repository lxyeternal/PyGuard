{
  "purpose": "The code defines a singleton class for handling deprecation warnings related to regex method usage in a linting tool, with mechanisms for logging warnings only once.",
  "sources": "Logging statements, class variables, and method parameters accessing rule and regex options.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs and return of regex methods (search/match).",
  "flows": "Deprecation class method retrieves regex methods based on configuration, logs warnings if needed, and returns regex functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or backdoors. The logging setup and method logic appear standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages deprecation warnings and does not process external input or execute external commands. The logging and warning management are standard practices. The use of regex functions is safe as long as regex_option.value is a standard regex object. No malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are detected. No obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration and warning handling component for a linting tool, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
