  "purpose": "CLI tool for git commit message linting, hook management, and configuration generation.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line options, environment variables, stdin, configuration files, and git data.",
  "sinks": "External shell commands (via shell()), file operations, output to console, subprocesses for editing.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and stdin feed into shell commands and file reads; outputs are printed or passed to external editors.",
  "anomalies": "Use of shell() for invoking editors; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured CLI utility that manages git hooks, reads configuration, and interacts with the system in a controlled manner. The use of shell() for invoking an editor is standard practice, assuming safe implementation. Input handling via stdin and environment variables appears secure. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk ~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the observed behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe CLI utility for git commit message linting and hook management. No malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation detected. The minor risk stems from external command invocation, which is typical for such tools and appears controlled. The scores are justified and accurate.",
