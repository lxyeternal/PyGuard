  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence provided, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a CLI tool for linting git commit messages, managing hooks, and generating configs. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, due to potential shell invocation)\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly notes that no malicious behavior is evident. The only potential concern is the use of `shell()` for invoking an editor, which is standard but could be risky if inputs are manipulated. However, in this context, the command is constructed from environment variables and user inputs in a controlled manner. The overall confidence is high (0.9), and no issues are identified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, emphasizing standard CLI behavior, input handling, and no malicious activity. Notes that `shell()` is used for editing commits, which is typical.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** Slightly higher at 0.2, due to `shell()` invocation.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The use of `shell()` for launching an editor is common, and no malicious activity is suggested. The input handling via `input()` prompts is standard, with no evident injection vulnerabilities.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the same points—no malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard practices, and safe input handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2, due to external shell invocation.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis aligns with the code's behavior. The `shell()` call is controlled, and no network activity or data exfiltration is observed.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the safe handling of inputs, configuration, and external commands. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1, due to `shell()` use.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The use of `shell()` for invoking an editor is standard for such tools and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same overall conclusion—no malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard CLI practices.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1, again due to `shell()` invocation.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is sound. The code's external interactions are typical for CLI tools managing git hooks and commit message linting.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the absence of any malicious activity, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), primarily due to the use of `shell()` for invoking an editor. This is standard but should be noted as a minor potential vector if inputs are manipulated, which seems unlikely here.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, mainly related to external command execution via `shell()`, which is a common pattern for CLI tools.\n\n**Summary:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented CLI utility for git commit message linting, hook management, and configuration generation. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is evident, and the minor risk score reflects typical external command invocation practices.",
