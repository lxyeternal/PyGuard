  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a CLI for linting, hook management, config generation. Inputs are user options, env vars, stdin, files.\n- **Sinks:** External commands (shell), file I/O, output.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity. The only potential concern is the `shell()` function, but its implementation isn't shown. It’s used for editing commit messages, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, with no malicious behavior. Malware score: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the report is reasonable. The use of `shell()` warrants attention but isn't inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar CLI functions, with inputs from config files, command-line, stdin, env vars, git data.\n- **Sinks:** Shell commands (`shell()`), output, file operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of `shell()` for editing commits is typical; no network activity or data exfiltration. The `input()` prompts are for user confirmation, standard in CLI tools.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; safe, with malware score 0. Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the standard use of external commands and safe input handling.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** CLI for linting, hook management, config generation.\n- **Sinks:** Shell commands, file I/O, output.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation. The `shell()` invocation for editors is standard; no malicious network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate tool, no malicious behavior; malware score: 0. Confidence: 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no malicious signs detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** CLI for linting, hook management, config.\n- **Sinks:** Shell commands, file operations, output.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of `shell()` for external editors is common; no hardcoded secrets or malicious activity. User prompts via `input()` are safe.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; safe, malware score: 0. Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-reasoned; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar CLI functions; inputs from command-line, env, stdin, files.\n- **Sinks:** External shell commands, file I/O, output.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard use of external commands for editing commit messages.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; malware score: 0. Confidence: 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence of malware or malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Risk Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Potential concerns:** The use of `shell()` for invoking editors could be risky if inputs are manipulated, but in context, it is a standard pattern and appears controlled.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a CLI tool for git commit message linting, hook management, and config generation.\n- It handles user inputs, environment variables, files, and stdin safely.\n- External command invocations are limited to standard operations (e.g., invoking an editor), with no network activity or data exfiltration.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious code is present.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimate:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                               |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 | No malicious activity detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 | Code is clear and well-structured.                           |\n| Risk           | 0.1 - 0.2         | Minor risks related to external command execution but standard in CLI tools. |\n\n**Overall, the code is a legitimate, safe CLI utility with no signs of malware or malicious intent.**",
