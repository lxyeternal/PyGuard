{
  "purpose": "This code defines utility functions and constants for platform detection and encoding preferences, mainly for ensuring proper handling of text encodings based on system environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('LC_ALL', 'LC_CTYPE', 'LANG') accessed via os.environ.get; platform.system() called for platform detection.",
  "sinks": "No direct data leaks or security-sensitive actions; no external network calls or file writes with untrusted data; just system info reads.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read to determine preferred encoding, which influences how text is processed; platform detection influences behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; code comments indicate deliberate design choices for testability and environment handling. No obfuscation or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment inspection and platform detection with safe system calls. It avoids executing untrusted code or writing sensitive data. It uses standard Python libraries to determine system and environment configurations. No suspicious or malicious activities are evident. The functions are straightforward and do not perform any network, file, or data exfiltration actions. Overall, the code appears benign and purpose-specific.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, primarily for system configuration and encoding handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on the provided code fragment.",
