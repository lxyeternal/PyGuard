  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling gitlint-related errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code",
  "flows": "No data flow as the code only defines an exception class",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is a straightforward class definition",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class named 'GitlintError' that inherits from Python's built-in Exception class. It includes a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no external data sources, sinks, or data flows. The code is minimal and appears to be a simple, standard class definition for exception handling in a larger project. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard and harmless class definition for a custom exception. There are no malicious behaviors, anomalies, or security concerns present.",
