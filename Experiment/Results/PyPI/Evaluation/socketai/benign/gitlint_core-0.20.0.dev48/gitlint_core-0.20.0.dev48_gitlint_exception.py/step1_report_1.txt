  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for gitlint-related errors",
  "sources": "No input data sources; class definition does not read external data",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurring in this code",
  "flows": "No data flow present in this minimal class definition",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or unusual code behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class inheriting from Exception. It contains only a docstring and no executable or data-processing logic. There are no external data sources, no sensitive operations, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior. The class appears to serve as a structured exception for use elsewhere in the application.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward class definition with no malicious or security-related issues. It does not introduce any vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.",
