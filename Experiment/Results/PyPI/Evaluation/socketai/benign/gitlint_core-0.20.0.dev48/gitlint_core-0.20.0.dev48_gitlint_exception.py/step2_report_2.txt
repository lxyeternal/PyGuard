  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a minimal class definition:\n     ```python\n     class GitlintError(Exception):\n         \"\"\"Based Exception class for all gitlint exceptions\"\"\"\n     ```\n   - There are no signs of embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are involved.\n   - The class is a standard custom exception, likely used elsewhere in the application.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is a straightforward class definition with no malicious or security issues.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The analysis in each report correctly states that the code is benign and standard.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n   - The confidence score of 1 is justified, as the analysis is consistent and thorough.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, no higher risk scores are warranted.\n   - The code is not malicious, does not contain obfuscation, and poses no security risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and avoid assumptions, correctly identifying the code as benign.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all zeroes for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n   - The confidence scores of 1 reflect certainty in these assessments.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, harmless class definition used for exception handling. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the nature of the code.",
