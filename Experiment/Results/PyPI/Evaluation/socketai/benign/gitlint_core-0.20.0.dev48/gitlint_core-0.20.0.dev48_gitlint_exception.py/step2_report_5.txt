  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines a class `GitlintError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - The class contains only a docstring and no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, embedded secrets, or malicious code are present.\n\n2. **Issues Present?**\n   - Based on the code snippet and reports, there are no issues or vulnerabilities. The class serves as a standard custom exception class.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as a straightforward class definition.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent in the reports.\n\n4. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are zero, there is no need to justify higher risk scores.\n   - The code is clearly non-malicious and non-obfuscated.\n\n6. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n7. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - They acknowledge the code's simplicity and benign purpose.\n\n8. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the reports' conclusions.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard custom exception class with no security issues.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No modifications to the scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code snippet is harmless and standard. The reports correctly identify its benign nature. No security concerns or malicious behaviors are present.",
