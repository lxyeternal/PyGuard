{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator function 'tag' used to attach metadata to GraphQL schema elements, supporting different federation versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'graphene_type' argument, the 'name' parameter, and imports from external modules ('graphene_directives', 'graphene_federation.apollo_versions', '.utils').",
  "sinks": "The 'decorator' function resulting from 'directive_decorator' may modify the input 'field_or_type', which could be a schema type or field, but no direct data leaks or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'graphene_type' or 'field_or_type' flows through the 'wrapper' function, which applies a decorator. The 'name' parameter is used to generate directives. No untrusted data is executed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. External imports are standard for GraphQL schema tooling. No dynamic code execution, system calls, or network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily facilitates attaching metadata to GraphQL schema elements via decorators. It uses external libraries for directive handling, which is typical in schema definition workflows. No input validation or sanitization concerns are relevant here, as the parameters are used for metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage. The code structure is straightforward, with no suspicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a schema metadata decorator with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external, reputable GraphQL libraries and performs standard operations. No security issues or malware behaviors are detected.",
