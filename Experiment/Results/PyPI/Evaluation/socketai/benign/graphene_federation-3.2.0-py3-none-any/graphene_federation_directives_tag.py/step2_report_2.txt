  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Describes a decorator attaching metadata to GraphQL schema elements.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard parameters and external library calls; no data leaks or malicious actions.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns; straightforward usage.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard schema decoration.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no security issues or malware.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity) — aligns with analysis.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation) — aligns.  \n- Security Risk: 0 (no vulnerabilities) — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining a schema decorator.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Uses external functions for directives; no untrusted data flow.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Standard schema decoration, no external data or malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Benign utility, no risks.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — consistent.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Security Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, for applying 'tag' directives.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Applies directives via 'directive_decorator'; potential concern if 'directive_decorator' executes user code.\n- Anomalies: No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: The main point is whether 'directive_decorator' could execute malicious code. Given standard practices, it's a decorator factory that applies directives; unless 'directive_decorator' is malicious or untrusted, this is safe.\n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious behavior; standard schema decoration.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malicious activity indicated.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 — a slight caution due to potential for decorator execution, but unlikely.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Similar, attaching 'tag' metadata.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Uses external functions; potential concern if 'directive_decorator' executes untrusted code.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Same as above, standard decoration with no evident malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Benign utility.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 — minor concern, but unlikely.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Again, a schema decorator.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Similar pattern; no suspicious data flow.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies.\n- Analysis: Standard decoration, safe assumptions.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malware.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — straightforward code.  \n- Security Risk: 0 — no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Risk Score:** All are low (0 or 0.1). Given the code's purpose and lack of suspicious behavior, a risk score of 0.1 is reasonable, accounting for potential misuse if external functions are malicious, but unlikely here.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-understood pattern for attaching metadata to GraphQL schema elements. No evidence suggests malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The minor risk score reflects the theoretical possibility if external functions were compromised, but based on the provided code and context, this is very unlikely.",
