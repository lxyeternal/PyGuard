{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator function for applying a 'tag' directive to GraphQL schema elements, enabling custom metadata annotations for schema delivery and tooling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'graphene_type', 'name', and 'federation_version'; function calls to 'get_directive_from_name', 'directive_decorator', and 'is_non_field'.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'directive_decorator' which applies directives to schema fields or types; the decorator may execute user-defined code if improperly implemented.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> 'get_directive_from_name' and 'directive_decorator' -> 'wrapper' function applies decorator to field or type -> potentially executes user-provided decorator logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs. The code primarily performs schema metadata decoration with no external network activity or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and external libraries for schema directives, defines a 'tag' decorator function that attaches metadata to GraphQL schema elements, and handles different input scenarios. It relies on external functions to fetch directives and check input types. No data leakage, malicious payloads, or malicious logic is evident. The code appears to be a standard implementation for schema annotation in GraphQL Federation, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for adding metadata tags to GraphQL schema elements. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation appears straightforward and intended for schema tooling.",
