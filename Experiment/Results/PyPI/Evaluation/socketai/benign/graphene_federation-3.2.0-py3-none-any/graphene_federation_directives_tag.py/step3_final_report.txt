  "purpose": "Defines a decorator factory 'tag' that attaches metadata to GraphQL schema elements, supporting different federation versions.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'name' and 'federation_version'; external functions 'get_directive_from_name', 'directive_decorator', and 'is_non_field'.",
  "sinks": "Application of directives via 'directive_decorator' to schema types or fields, modifying schema metadata.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to retrieve directives and decorate schema elements; no untrusted data flows into code execution or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. External functions are standard and presumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for attaching metadata to GraphQL schema elements, utilizing external directive functions. It handles both types and fields with proper checks. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. External functions' security depends on their implementation, but their usage here is standard and safe. The code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard schema decoration utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
