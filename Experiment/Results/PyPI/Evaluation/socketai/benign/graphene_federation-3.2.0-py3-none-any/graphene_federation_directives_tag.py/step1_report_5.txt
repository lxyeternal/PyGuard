{
  "purpose": "Defines a decorator function to attach 'tag' metadata to GraphQL schema types or fields, enabling custom tooling during schema processing.",
  "sources": "User input via 'graphene_type' parameter, function parameters 'name' and 'federation_version', and imported functions 'get_directive_from_name' and 'directive_decorator'.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of 'directive_decorator' which applies metadata to schema elements, potentially affecting schema generation or execution.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (name, graphene_type, federation_version) flow into 'get_directive_from_name' and 'directive_decorator'; the decorator function then applies metadata based on these inputs to schema fields or types.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules related to GraphQL federation and defines a decorator 'tag' for adding metadata. It safely handles input parameters and applies decorators conditionally without executing external or unsafe code. The functions used ('get_directive_from_name' and 'directive_decorator') are imported, and their security depends on their implementations, but their use here appears standard. No suspicious logic, external data handling, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of a schema annotation decorator for GraphQL federation. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on its logic. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose in schema tooling.",
