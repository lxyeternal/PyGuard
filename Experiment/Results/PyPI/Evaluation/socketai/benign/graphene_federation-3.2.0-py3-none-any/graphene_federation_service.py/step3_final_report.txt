  "purpose": "Utility functions for extracting the SDL string from a GraphQL schema and creating a federation service query object.",
  "sources": "The 'schema' parameter passed into get_sdl and get_service_query functions; the string conversion of the schema object.",
  "sinks": "The resolve_sdl method returns the schema SDL string; the resolve__service method returns the _Service object containing the SDL.",
  "flows": "Schema object -> str(schema) -> SDL string -> returned by resolver functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for schema introspection in GraphQL federation. It serializes a schema object into a string and exposes it via GraphQL resolvers. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input beyond the schema object. The resolvers simply return static or derived data, with no external dependencies or side effects. The code is standard and safe for its purpose, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for exposing GraphQL schema SDL for federation purposes. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
