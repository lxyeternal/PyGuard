  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for extracting SDL schema string and defining a GraphQL service query for federation.",
  "sources": "Reads input from schema parameter passed to get_sdl and get_service_query functions.",
  "sinks": "Returns schema string; provides a GraphQL query object.",
  "flows": "get_sdl reads schema, converts to string; get_service_query calls get_sdl and constructs GraphQL ObjectType classes that return schema info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports GraphQL-related modules and defines two functions: get_sdl and get_service_query. get_sdl converts a schema object into a string and trims it. get_service_query constructs GraphQL ObjectType classes, defining a _service field that returns schema info. The schema parameter is used only for reading data, and the functions do not perform any network operations, data leaks, or code execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The code is standard for GraphQL schema handling and does not exhibit obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for GraphQL schema handling with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely exposes schema information via GraphQL queries without any malicious side effects.",
