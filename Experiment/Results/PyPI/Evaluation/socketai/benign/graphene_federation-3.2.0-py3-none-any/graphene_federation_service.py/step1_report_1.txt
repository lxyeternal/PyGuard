{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for extracting SDL (Schema Definition Language) from a GraphQL schema and creating a service query object for federation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'schema' parameter passed to 'get_sdl' and 'get_service_query' functions.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the SDL string and constructs GraphQL ObjectType classes and fields, which are not inherently dangerous.",
  "flows": "The 'schema' input flows into 'get_sdl' to produce a string, which is then used in 'resolve_sdl'. The 'get_service_query' constructs a class with a resolver that returns this SDL string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code structures are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward functions to convert a GraphQL schema object into a string representation and to create GraphQL ObjectType classes with simple resolver methods. There are no inputs from untrusted sources besides the 'schema' parameter, which appears to be a GraphQL schema object. The resolvers simply return data derived from this object without processing untrusted input or executing external code. No use of network, file I/O, or environment variables that could be exploited is present. The structure is standard for GraphQL schema definitions, and there is no suspicious behavior or malicious intent observable.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe utility for schema introspection and GraphQL object type construction. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malicious payloads, or security risks in this code fragment.",
