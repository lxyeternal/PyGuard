  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's behavior, and assess the scores.\n\n**Code Behavior Summary:**\n- The code provides utility functions to convert a GraphQL schema object into its SDL string and to generate a GraphQL ObjectType class with a resolver that returns this SDL.\n- The functions do not perform any network I/O, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted input beyond the schema object.\n- The schema object is assumed to be a valid GraphQL schema, likely created within the application or by trusted sources.\n- The resolvers simply return the schema's string representation; no malicious payloads or obfuscation are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports conclude that the code is straightforward, standard, and safe. No malicious or suspicious behavior is observed.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify that the code is utility-focused, with no security concerns.\n\n- **Scores given (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk):**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Scores:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  Since the code only serializes and exposes schema information without executing untrusted code or network activity, malware=0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  The code is clear and straightforward; obfuscated=0 is justified.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  The code does not handle untrusted input in a dangerous way, nor does it leak sensitive data or perform insecure operations. securityRisk=0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk Score (overall):**  \n  The reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Consistency & Potential Caveats:\n- **Potential for misuse?**  \n  The only concern could be if exposing schema SDL via GraphQL resolvers leaks sensitive internal schema details. However, this is a standard pattern in federation setups, and the code itself doesn't introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Assumptions about input schema:**  \n  If the schema object is untrusted or malformed, it could cause issues, but this is outside the scope of the code itself.\n\n- **Is there any reason to raise the risk score?**  \n  No. The code does not exhibit malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate. The code is a safe, standard utility for GraphQL schema introspection and federation support. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, with no indicators of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
