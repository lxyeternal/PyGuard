{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to extract SDL from a GraphQL schema and defines a GraphQL federation service query schema.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'schema' object in get_sdl() and get_service_query() functions, and constructs GraphQL ObjectType classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is written or exposed, as the code only serializes and returns schema information.",
  "flows": "The schema object is converted to string in get_sdl(), and get_service_query() encapsulates this SDL within a GraphQL ObjectType response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to typical GraphQL schema patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions to obtain SDL from a schema and to create a service query for federation. It involves serializing schema objects and creating GraphQL ObjectType classes with resolvers. No external inputs, environment variables, or dynamic execution are present. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected. The code appears to be standard utility code for GraphQL schema management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility for GraphQL schema serialization and federation setup, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
