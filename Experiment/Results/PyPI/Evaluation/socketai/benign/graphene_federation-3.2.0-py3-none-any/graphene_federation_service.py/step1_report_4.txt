{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to extract schema SDL as a string and define a GraphQL federation service query.",
  "sources": "The code reads the schema object in get_sdl(schema), and schema in get_service_query(schema).",
  "sinks": "The get_sdl function outputs a string representation of the schema; the get_service_query function returns a schema object that could be used in a GraphQL server.",
  "flows": "Schema object is converted to string in get_sdl, then potentially used in a GraphQL server context. The ServiceQuery class exposes a resolver that returns schema SDL, which could be accessed externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present. No dynamic code execution or external network activity is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for schema processing and GraphQL type definitions. It uses standard patterns of GraphQL schema and resolver definitions. The get_sdl function safely returns the string form of the schema; get_service_query creates GraphQL types with resolvers that return this string. No input/output flows suggest malicious data handling or suspicious behavior. The code does not interact with external resources or perform insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard GraphQL schema utility code with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely intended for schema introspection or federation purposes without exposing sensitive data or performing harmful actions.",
