  "purpose": "Defines utility functions and GraphQL schema for schema introspection and federation support.",
  "sources": "Input data is the 'schema' argument passed to get_sdl() and get_service_query(), which is used to generate SDL string and schema object.",
  "sinks": "The string representation of the schema in get_sdl(), and the returned ObjectType classes that provide schema information.",
  "flows": "The schema object is converted to string in get_sdl(), then passed to get_service_query() which embeds it in a resolver for SDL. The flow from schema input to the schema SDL string is straightforward; the schema string is returned via resolvers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or obfuscated code present. Use of schema string in resolvers is standard for GraphQL schema introspection.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: get_sdl() converts a schema object to its string form, and get_service_query() creates GraphQL ObjectType classes with resolvers that return this schema SDL. Both classes serve standard schema introspection purposes, especially in federation. No user input, external data, or dynamic code execution is involved. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard GraphQL schema helper functions for federation support, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
