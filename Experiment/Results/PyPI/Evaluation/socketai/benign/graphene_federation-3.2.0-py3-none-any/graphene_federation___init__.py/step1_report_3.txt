{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various GraphQL directives, schema builders, and versioning constants to facilitate schema composition and directive management in a GraphQL service.",
  "sources": "Imports from other modules (.apollo_versions, .composable_directive, .directives, .schema, .schema_directives, .service)",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or network communication",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; primarily static imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation observed; straightforward import and export statements",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements, constant definitions, and an __all__ export list. There are no data inputs, external data processing, or network operations. It does not perform any runtime logic, user input handling, or system modifications. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detectable based on this static code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a GraphQL Python project, importing necessary components and defining exported symbols. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
