{
  "purpose": "Organizes and re-exports GraphQL directives, schema components, and version constants for modular use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.apollo_versions, .composable_directive, etc.)",
  "sinks": "None; static import/export module with no data sinks or external data handling",
  "flows": "Import statements to __all__ list for module exports",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export pattern, no suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module that imports various components related to GraphQL schema and directives, then re-exports them via __all__. No dynamic execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. All reports confirm the code's benign nature, assigning malware and security risk scores of 0. The code's purpose is organizational, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities. The imported modules are assumed to be safe, and the code itself does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static organizational module with no malicious behavior or security risks. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
