{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various components, directives, and functions related to schema building and GraphQL directives, likely for use in a larger GraphQL server or schema management system.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.apollo_versions, .composable_directive, .directives, .schema, .schema_directives, .service) and the __all__ list defining exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this code; no functions or operations that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks, code execution, or network communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply imports modules and defines an export list without processing external input or executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The import statements are standard, and the code structure is typical for a Python module.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ list for module exports. It imports components related to GraphQL directives and schema building, which is common in schema definition files. No dynamic execution, input handling, or network operations are present. The code does not include any signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The presence of local module imports suggests this is part of a larger, controlled codebase, not a malicious package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python module for organizing and exporting GraphQL schema components. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. All elements are typical and do not indicate any supply chain compromise or malicious behavior.",
