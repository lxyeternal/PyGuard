  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Behavior**  \n   The code is a simple Python module that imports various components (directives, schema builders, version constants) and then re-exports them via the `__all__` list. It contains no dynamic code, no data processing, no network activity, and no user input handling. It appears to be a straightforward organizational module.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**  \n   All reports agree that the code is purely import/export with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no external data sinks are present.\n\n3. **Assessment of Security Risks & Malware**  \n   Given the static, non-executing nature of this module, and the lack of any suspicious code patterns, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The reports' malware scores are all zero, which aligns with this assessment.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Logical Errors**  \n   The reports do not identify any logical flaws or errors. The code's purpose is clear and standard.\n\n5. **Scores Justification**  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as there's no obfuscation.  \n   - **Malware Score:** 0, no malicious activity detected.  \n   - **Risk Score:** 0, as the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n6. **Conclusion & Final Assessment**  \n   All reports consistently indicate that this is a benign, standard module with no security concerns. The scores assigned (all zeros for malware and security risk) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores based on this review:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign, straightforward Python module that functions solely as an organizational import/export script for GraphQL schema components. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n\n---\n\nIf you have further context or suspect this code is part of a larger supply chain concern, please provide additional details. But based on the static analysis here, this code is safe.",
