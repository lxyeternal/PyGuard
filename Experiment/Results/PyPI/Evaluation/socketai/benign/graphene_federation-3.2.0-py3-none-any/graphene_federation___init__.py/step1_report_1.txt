{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an import and export module, organizing and exposing various GraphQL-related components, directives, and utility functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Imported modules and functions: 'graphene_directives', 'apollo_versions', 'composable_directive', 'directives', 'schema', 'schema_directives', 'service'. These are used to gather dependencies and internal components.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing points are present. The code does not handle user input, environment variables, or external data directly.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules, gathers specific components, and re-exports them via __all__ for external use. There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The module is purely organizational and export-oriented.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports various modules and functions related to GraphQL schema and directives. It then consolidates these components into the __all__ list for external access. There is no evidence of code execution based on untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, network activity, or other suspicious behavior. The module functions as a straightforward aggregator, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple organizational module for exporting GraphQL components. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a benign and standard pattern in Python projects.",
