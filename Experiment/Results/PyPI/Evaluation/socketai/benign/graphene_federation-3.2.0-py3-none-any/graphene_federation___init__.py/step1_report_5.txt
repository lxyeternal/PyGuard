{
  "purpose": "The code primarily imports various modules and functions related to GraphQL schema directives and versions, then exports them for use elsewhere. Its main purpose appears to be modular organization and exposure of components for a GraphQL federation setup.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.apollo_versions, .composable_directive, .directives, .schema, .schema_directives, .service)",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no untrusted data handling, external network connections, or sensitive data processing are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears standard for a module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import and export module, organizing and exposing various components related to GraphQL federation. It does not contain any input/output handling, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior, no sensitive data handling, and no security issues. It functions solely as an organizational script for GraphQL directives and related components.",
