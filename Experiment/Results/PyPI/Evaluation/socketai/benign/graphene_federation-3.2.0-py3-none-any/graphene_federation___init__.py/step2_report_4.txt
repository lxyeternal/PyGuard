  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module that imports various components and re-exports them via `__all__`. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity. The code appears purely organizational.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks. No logical errors or omissions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0  \n   \n   These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since all reports agree on zero for malware and security risk, and the code is purely import/export with no dynamic or external data handling, there is no justification for increasing these scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   The malware score is zero across all reports, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All claims are based on static analysis and are reasonable. No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made; the analysis is thorough and consistent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature—simple import/export module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (no obfuscation or unusual code patterns)\n- **Risk Score**: **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard Python module serving as an organizational layer for GraphQL components. It contains no code execution, no external data handling, and no suspicious patterns. All evidence points to a benign, well-structured component with no supply chain security issues.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe provided reports are accurate and comprehensive. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
