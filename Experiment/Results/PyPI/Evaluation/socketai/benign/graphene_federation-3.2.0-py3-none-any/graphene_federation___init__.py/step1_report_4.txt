{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various components related to GraphQL schema directives and versioning, and then exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from other modules: graphene_directives, .apollo_versions, .composable_directive, .directives, .schema, .schema_directives, .service",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or actions; no network, file, or environment variable operations are present",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to module imports and exporting components; no runtime data processing or user input handling observed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code structures, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors identified",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports various components and then re-exports them via __all__, indicating a module setup or package interface. There are no functions, data processing, or external calls that could pose security risks. The imported modules are likely internal or external dependencies, but their usage here is standard. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module setup for a GraphQL schema package, with no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
