{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports various components or functions from local modules within a package, likely for organizational or modular design purposes.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data; all imports are static and local.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or operations that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; the code only performs imports, which do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements with no additional logic, which is typical for module setup. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple components from sibling modules, indicating modular organization. There are no functions, data handling, or network operations. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or hidden logic, are present. The absence of code beyond imports suggests this is a standard import block.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of import statements used for modular organization. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be benign and purely structural.",
