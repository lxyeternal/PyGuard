  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read directly in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows, input processing, or data sinks in this static import list.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements without any executable logic, which is typical and not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "This fragment is a straightforward list of import statements for local modules, probably to organize features or functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The imports seem to be part of a modular design, possibly for an API or access control system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of module imports without any suspicious or malicious elements. No security issues or malware signals are detected.",
