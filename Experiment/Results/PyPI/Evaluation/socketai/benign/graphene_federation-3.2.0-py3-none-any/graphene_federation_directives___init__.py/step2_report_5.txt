  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \nAll reports confirm that the code consists solely of static import statements for local modules. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or embedded payloads are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, standard for modular Python packages, and lacks any malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. This is appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Risk Score Analysis:**  \nThe risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the context. Since the code is purely static imports with no suspicious behavior, there's no reason to increase the risk score.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**  \nNo vulnerabilities are claimed or implied beyond the import statements. The reports correctly challenge any assumptions about malicious intent, confirming the benign nature.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis provided. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Evaluation and Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)  \n\n**Overall, I agree with the assessments provided.** The code is a standard, benign module import block with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a typical, safe code snippet with no malicious or risky elements.",
