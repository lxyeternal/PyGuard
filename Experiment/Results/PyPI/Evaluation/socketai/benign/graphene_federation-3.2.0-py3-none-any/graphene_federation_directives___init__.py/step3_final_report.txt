{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module import list, integrating various components related to authentication, policy, extension, and other functionalities within a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static import statements from local modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only imports modules without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements importing local modules, with no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The module names suggest standard components of a modular security or policy framework. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis. The code's static and structural nature indicates no vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The absence of dynamic code, secrets, or external communication confirms the low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module import block with no malicious or security concerns. The reports and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
