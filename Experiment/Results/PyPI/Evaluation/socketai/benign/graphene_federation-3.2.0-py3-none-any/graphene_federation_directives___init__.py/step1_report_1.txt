  "purpose": "Import statements for various modules or components within a package, likely for modular functionality or feature inclusion.",
  "sources": "Import statements referencing local modules: authenticated, extends, external, inaccessible, interface_object, key, override, policy, provides, requires, requires_scope, shareable, tag.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as system calls, network connections, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows; import statements load modules but do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements importing various modules from the current package. There are no function definitions, data processing, network activity, or embedded malicious code. The import list appears organized and standard for modular Python packages. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as module imports within a Python package. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified based on the provided snippet.",
