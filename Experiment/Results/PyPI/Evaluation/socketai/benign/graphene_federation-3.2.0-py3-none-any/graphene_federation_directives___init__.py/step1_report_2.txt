{
  "purpose": "This code imports multiple modules or components, likely as part of a package or framework setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements referencing local modules (e.g., .authenticated, .extends, .external, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual language features, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from sibling modules within a package, indicating standard modular organization. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or suspicious patterns are present. The imported module names suggest typical components of a system (e.g., authentication, policies, extensions). There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads. The structure is straightforward and typical of a well-organized package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of import statements for package modularization, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
