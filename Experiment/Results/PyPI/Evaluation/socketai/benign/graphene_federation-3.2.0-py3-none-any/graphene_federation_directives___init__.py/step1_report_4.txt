  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various components or submodules, likely as part of a larger project or package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules within the same package (indicated by leading dots).",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in this code; no data is being processed, output, or sent over network connections.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this code snippet; it only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "All imported names are standard-looking module identifiers. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. No dynamic execution or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs relative imports of specific modules or components, which is typical in package structure. There is no code execution, data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The import statements are straightforward and adhere to common Python practices. No anomalies, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated code are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of import statements for local modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of a package's internal structure.",
