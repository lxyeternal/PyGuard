  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code constructs a GraphQL schema with federation and directives, based on function inputs and external modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external unsafe operations or data leaks; primarily schema assembly.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Dynamic schema and directive handling are standard.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a schema builder with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar schema construction, with emphasis on dynamic directives and federation support.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No unsafe external calls; dynamic class creation is typical.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious intent; potential risk in handling untrusted directives, but overall standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Secure schema builder, with minimal risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — acceptable, considering dynamic directives.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, focusing on schema and directives.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Schema functions could be misused if directives are malicious, but no actual malicious code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard schema construction.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; standard utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Building schema with federation and directives.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Dynamic schema modifications are typical; no external unsafe operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected; standard schema logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate schema builder, no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Schema construction with federation and directives.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No harmful operations; schema assembly is standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard schema setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (score=0). The code is a schema builder, not executing any malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the dynamic handling of directives and schema, the risk is minimal but present if inputs are malicious. The reports assign 0.2, which is reasonable considering potential misuse if external inputs are maliciously crafted.\n- **Confidence:** High confidence (0.9) across reports, as the code is straightforward.\n\n### Final expert judgment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (potential if inputs are malicious, but overall low)\n- **Reasoning:** The code is a standard, schema-building utility with no malicious logic, backdoors, or unsafe operations. The only concern is misuse if external directives or inputs are malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0              |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2            |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review, confirming the code's purpose as a schema construction utility with no malicious intent.",
