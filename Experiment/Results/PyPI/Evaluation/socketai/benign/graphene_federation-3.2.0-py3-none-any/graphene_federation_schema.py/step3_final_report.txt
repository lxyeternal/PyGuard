{
  "purpose": "Constructs a GraphQL schema supporting federation, directives, and schema extensions with dynamic class and directive management.",
  "sources": "Function arguments, imported modules, external directive functions, and schema type map.",
  "sinks": "Schema creation functions, directive application, and type modifications within the schema object.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into schema construction functions; directives and types are dynamically added to the schema object.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious external calls detected. Dynamic schema and directive handling are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code builds a GraphQL schema with support for federation and custom directives, using dynamic class creation and directive decoration. It does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or system modifications. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of external functions and directives appears standard and safe. The only potential concern is the misuse of directives if inputs are malicious, but this is inherent to schema configuration and not an active vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured schema builder for GraphQL with federation support. It contains no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The minor security risk score reflects potential misuse if external inputs are malicious, but the code itself is safe.",
