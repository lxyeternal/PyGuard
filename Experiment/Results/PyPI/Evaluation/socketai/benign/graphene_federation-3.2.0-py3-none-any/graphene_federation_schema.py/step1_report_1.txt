{
  "purpose": "This code constructs and manages a GraphQL schema with support for Apollo Federation, custom directives, and schema directives, facilitating schema composition, federation support, and directive management.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments (e.g., query, mutation, subscription, types, directives, schema_directives, federation_version) and external imported modules/functions (e.g., get_directives_based_on_version, get_directive_from_name).",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to write or transmit untrusted data to external systems or perform unsafe operations such as system calls, network connections, or file manipulations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence the construction of schema components, directives, and federation configurations; schema is built via build_directive_schema, with custom directives potentially modifying the schema structure. There are no external output flows that handle untrusted data or network connections.",
  "anomalies": "The code mainly performs schema construction and directive management with no apparent hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. It dynamically handles directives and schema types, which could be misused if directives are malicious, but the code itself does not contain malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is schema assembly for a GraphQL API with federation and directive support. It fetches directives based on version, constructs schema with options for custom directives, and adds federation-specific fields and directives. No indications of malicious intent, code injection, or privacy leaks are present. The code's dynamic nature, especially handling directives and schema modifications, does not appear suspicious but requires trust in external directives and imported functions. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads detected. Overall, it is a schema-building utility with no malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured GraphQL schema builder with support for federation and custom directives. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code segment. The logic focuses on schema configuration and directive management without external unsafe interactions.",
