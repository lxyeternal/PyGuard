  "purpose": "This code appears to define utility functions for extracting GraphQL entity types and creating a query for retrieving entities based on schema directives.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the provided schema object, including type maps, directives, and representations in the resolve_entities function.",
  "sinks": "Uses untrusted input 'representations' in resolve_entities to dynamically generate model instances; potential injection points if representations are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input from representations -> type lookup and model creation -> model instance initialization -> optional resolver invocation.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; reliance on dynamic type resolution and flexible argument parsing could be misused if representations are untrusted. No obfuscation or suspicious code structures identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily processes schema metadata and user-provided representations to generate entity instances dynamically. It includes standard pattern of schema introspection, type resolution, and model instantiation. No direct code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity is present. The dynamic handling of representations relies on input data, which could be exploited if input is malicious; however, this is typical in GraphQL resolvers. The code does not perform any network calls, file operations, or system modifications. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for GraphQL schema processing and entity resolution. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. Security risks are limited to the handling of untrusted input representations, which could potentially be misused if malicious data is supplied, but this is typical for GraphQL resolvers. Overall, the code appears legitimate with no malicious intent.",
