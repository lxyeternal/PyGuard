  "purpose": "Define a custom GraphQL directive (@external) for federated schemas, indicating external fields not resolved locally.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'typing', 'graphene_directives', 'graphene_federation.apollo_versions', and local '.utils'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code mainly defines a function and a decorator without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a function 'external' that creates a GraphQL directive decorator based on federation version, and wraps input fields or types. It uses a helper 'is_non_field' to determine how to apply the decorator. All components appear to be standard and well-structured for GraphQL schema extension. No external calls, network activity, or data manipulation of untrusted input is present. The code is purely declarative and does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for defining a GraphQL federation directive without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
