  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the concerns are justified, whether the code presents any security risks, and if the scoring aligns with the findings.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of a GraphQL directive decorator, specifically for the `@external` directive used in federation schemas.\n- It relies on external functions (`get_directive_from_name`, `directive_decorator`, `is_non_field`) which are assumed to be safe and standard in this context.\n- No data from untrusted sources is processed directly.\n- No network, file, or environment variable interactions are present.\n- The logic is clear, well-structured, and adheres to common patterns for schema directives.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly implements the intended functionality. No issues are identified in the logic or implementation.\n- **Malware presence:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risks:** The code does not perform any unsafe operations, handle sensitive data, or interact with external systems in an insecure manner.\n\n### Specific points on scores:\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign a very low risk score (mostly 0 or 0.1). Given the code's nature, this is reasonable.\n- **Confidence levels:** Mostly 1, indicating high confidence in the safety assessment.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports do not identify any actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- They correctly note that the code is standard, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- The only minor concern is a very slight security risk score of 0.1 in report 4, but given the code's nature, this is likely an overestimation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard schema directive decorator with no signs of security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The minimal risk score in one report appears to be an overestimation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                      |\n| Security Risk  | 0                      |\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
