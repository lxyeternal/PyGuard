  "purpose": "Define a custom GraphQL directive (@external) used in federation to annotate fields that are externally resolved or referenced.",
  "sources": "get_directive_from_name('external', federation_version), directive_decorator(directive), is_non_field(field_or_type), input parameters to the external function",
  "sinks": "decorator(field=None) and decorator(field=field_or_type), return statements, any call to get_directive_from_name",
  "flows": "external() calls get_directive_from_name to retrieve directive info -> wraps with directive_decorator -> applies to field or type -> potentially modifies behavior via decorator",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code structures observed. Usage of external library functions appears legitimate and well-defined.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a GraphQL directive wrapper for @external, using imported functions to fetch directives and decorators. It includes a conditional wrapper for non-field types and supports both direct application and decorator usage. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payload, or suspicious behavior are present. The logic is straightforward, focusing on code organization for a GraphQL schema, with external dependencies providing expected functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a GraphQL federation directive without malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected. The code relies on imported functions from external libraries, which seem standard for GraphQL federation setup.",
