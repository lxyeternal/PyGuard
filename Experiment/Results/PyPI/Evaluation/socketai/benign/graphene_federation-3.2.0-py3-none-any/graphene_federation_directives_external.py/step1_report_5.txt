{
  "purpose": "Defines a GraphQL directive decorator for @external, used in federated schemas to mark fields that are externally resolved.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'graphene_type' and 'federation_version'; imported functions and modules, especially 'get_directive_from_name' and 'directive_decorator'.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No network, file, or environment operations are performed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and imported functions flow into 'get_directive_from_name' and 'directive_decorator', which generate decorators applied to schema fields.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected. The code uses well-defined functions for creating directives.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and functions to create a GraphQL directive decorator. It defines an 'external' function that generates a decorator for the '@external' directive, considering the federation version. The 'wrapper' function applies the decorator appropriately depending on whether the input is a field or type, with a check via 'is_non_field'. The logic is straightforward, adheres to expected patterns for GraphQL directive creation, and does not include any code that interacts with external systems, handles sensitive data, or performs unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a GraphQL directive decorator with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on imported modules and functions for core functionality, with no suspicious patterns. The overall security risk is very low.",
