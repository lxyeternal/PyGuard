{
  "purpose": "Defines a Python function 'external' that creates a GraphQL directive decorator for the '@external' directive used in federation schemas.",
  "sources": "Retrieves directive via 'get_directive_from_name', applies decorator through 'directive_decorator', and checks target type with 'is_non_field'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing; no external network, file, or environment variable interactions.",
  "flows": "Gets directive based on name and federation version, then applies decorator conditionally based on whether the target is a field or type.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation; code is straightforward and standard for schema directives.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a GraphQL directive decorator, importing well-known functions, and applying them correctly. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or include any malicious logic. External functions are assumed safe. The code's structure and purpose are clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately zero, with a very minimal risk score possibly overestimating dependency concerns. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and aligns with best practices for schema directives.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe implementation of a GraphQL federation directive decorator with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All indicators confirm its benign nature.",
