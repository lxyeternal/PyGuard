{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python decorator function 'external' that applies a GraphQL federation directive, specifically for marking fields as external in a federated GraphQL schema.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing', 'graphene_directives', 'graphene_federation.apollo_versions', and a local module '.utils'. The 'get_directive_from_name' function fetches directives based on name and federation version.",
  "sinks": "The decorator function 'decorator' applies a directive to a GraphQL field or type, but the code itself does not process untrusted data or user input directly.",
  "flows": "The 'external' function retrieves a directive object, creates a decorator, and applies it to the provided GraphQL type or field, with a check for non-field types using 'is_non_field'. No external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated logic, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward, using standard decorator patterns and function calls.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for GraphQL directive handling, defines a function to mark schema elements as external for federation, and includes a wrapper that applies the directive to a type or field. It uses a helper to determine if the target is a non-field, adjusting application accordingly. No untrusted data processing, external network calls, or credential handling is present. The logic is consistent with standard schema decoration practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a GraphQL federation directive decorator with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain suspicious logic. Overall, it appears safe and standard.",
