{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom GraphQL directive 'external' for use in federated schemas, primarily indicating unresolved object fields.",
  "sources": "Import statements for typing, directive_decorator, FederationVersion, LATEST_VERSION, get_directive_from_name, and is_non_field function.",
  "sinks": "The main function creates and returns decorators and wrappers that may modify fields or types; no direct data sinks such as network, file, or environment variables are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (graphene_type, federation_version) flows into get_directive_from_name and directive_decorator; then, the wrapper applies the decorator to fields or types, potentially modifying or annotating them.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; usage of standard library, well-documented external functions, and typical decorator patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a function to create a GraphQL directive with optional type input, and uses an internal wrapper to apply the directive decorator. The get_directive_from_name and directive_decorator are external functions assumed to be safe. The is_non_field function checks if the input is a non-field type, influencing how the decorator is applied. No data is read from untrusted sources, and no network or system modifications occur. The logic is straightforward and typical for schema directives.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a GraphQL directive decorator, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply provides schema annotation functionality within a GraphQL federation context.",
