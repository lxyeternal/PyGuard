  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of a GraphQL directive decorator for @external, used in federation schemas.\n- It relies on external functions: `get_directive_from_name`, `directive_decorator`, and `is_non_field`.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or untrusted input processing are evident.\n- The code is well-structured, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious constructs are present.\n\n**Specific analysis:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's purpose.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard decorator pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; no security concerns.\n- **Malware & Risk:** 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is benign, and the security risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No anomalies; straightforward logic.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct; no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Risk:** 0, consistent with the code.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid.\n- **Malware & Risk:** 0, appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious constructs.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid.\n- **Malware & Risk:** 0.1 risk score is slightly above zero, but the report states \"no signs of malicious behavior.\" The low score could be due to the reliance on external functions, but without evidence of malicious intent, this seems overly cautious.\n\n**Recommendation:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity, a malware score of 0 is more appropriate. The security risk should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No anomalies.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid.\n- **Malware & Risk:** 0, consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of a GraphQL directive decorator.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.\n- The external functions are assumed to be safe, as they are standard for GraphQL schema handling.\n- The risk and malware scores assigned in the reports are generally appropriate, with the exception of Report 4, which assigns a very low but non-zero malware score.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** Should be **0** since there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remains **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Should be **0** as the code is purely declarative, with no external data processing or system modifications.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no security risks or malware indications. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscated scores at zero and overall risk at zero.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
