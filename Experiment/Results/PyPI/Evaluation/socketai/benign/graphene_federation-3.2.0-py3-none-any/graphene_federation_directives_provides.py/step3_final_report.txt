  "purpose": "Decorator for GraphQL federation directives to specify entity fields resolvable at certain schema paths.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'fields', external functions 'get_directive_from_name', 'ast_to_str', 'build_ast', 'directive_decorator'.",
  "sinks": "Application of directive via decorator, conversion of 'fields' into AST string, validation in 'is_non_field'.",
  "flows": "Input 'fields' -> 'build_ast' -> 'ast_to_str' -> directive application in decorator.",
  "anomalies": "Potential handling of untrusted 'fields' input which could contain malicious GraphQL syntax; reliance on external trusted functions mitigates risk.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator that converts 'fields' into a GraphQL AST string and applies a federation directive. It validates application scope and processes input with trusted external functions. No code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The main concern is schema injection via malicious 'fields', but this does not constitute malicious code or malware. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a GraphQL federation directive decorator with no malware or obfuscation detected. The only minimal security concern relates to unvalidated 'fields' input potentially causing schema injection, but this is a common schema handling issue, not malicious activity.",
