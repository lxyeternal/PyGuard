{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator function 'provides' for GraphQL schema directives, specifically for federation purposes, to specify entity fields resolvable by a subgraph.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters 'fields' and 'graphene_type', and imports from external modules such as 'graphene_directives', 'graphene_federation', and local utils.",
  "sinks": "The code uses functions like 'ast_to_str' and 'build_ast' to process the 'fields' parameter, and calls 'directive_decorator' with a directive object. No direct untrusted data sinks or external network calls are evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'fields' is transformed via 'build_ast' and 'ast_to_str' into a directive argument string, then used in the decorator. The 'graphene_type' is wrapped with the decorator if provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code mainly performs schema directive decoration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'provides' decorator that processes input parameters to generate a GraphQL directive with proper AST transformation. It performs validation to ensure correct application scope. No suspicious external calls or malicious logic detected. The use of 'ast_to_str' and 'build_ast' appears to be legitimate schema processing steps. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for schema directive annotation within a GraphQL federation context. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It functions as intended for schema augmentation without suspicious behavior.",
