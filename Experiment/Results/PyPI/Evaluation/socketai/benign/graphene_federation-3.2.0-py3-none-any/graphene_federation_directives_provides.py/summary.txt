  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a GraphQL federation directive decorator with no malware or obfuscation detected. The only minimal security concern relates to unvalidated 'fields' input potentially causing schema injection, but this is a common schema handling issue, not malicious activity."
