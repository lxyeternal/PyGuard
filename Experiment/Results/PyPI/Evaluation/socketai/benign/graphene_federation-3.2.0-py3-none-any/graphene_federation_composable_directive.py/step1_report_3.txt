  "purpose": "Define a custom GraphQL directive class with optional schema integration features.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as name, locations, args, description, extensions, ast_node, spec_url, add_to_schema_directives.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present; class initialization uses parameters only for configuration.",
  "flows": "Parameters are used to set attributes and initialize parent class; no external data flow or execution of untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Assertions ensure required parameters are provided.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from GraphQLDirective, primarily for creating directives with additional schema-related attributes. It performs attribute copying from a custom directive object and sets class attributes accordingly. The code employs standard Python and GraphQL library usage without any external data inputs or unsafe operations. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a custom GraphQL directive wrapper, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is mainly for defining and extending directive functionality in a GraphQL schema.",
