  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the potential security implications, scores, and validity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the class as a schema directive wrapper supporting federation, with a focus on `spec_url` validation and attribute copying from an external object.\n- **Findings:** The assertion that `spec_url` must be provided if `add_to_schema_directives` is True is a validation step. The dynamic copying of attributes from `self.graphene_directive.__dict__` is a reflection of the external directive object, but no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — minor concern about copying attributes without validation, but overall low risk.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 — reasonable certainty.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Verdict:** The code appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious intent. The only minor concern is attribute copying without validation, which is typical in such patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes the class as a straightforward, schema-related directive class with no external data handling.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted input, no network activity, no data leaks, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Verdict:** Completely benign. No security issues or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizing standard class setup, parameter validation, and attribute assignment.\n- **Findings:** No external data sources, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Verdict:** Safe, standard class for GraphQL directive creation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the class's role in schema construction, with no external data handling or malicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No user input, no network calls, straightforward attribute management.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Verdict:** No malicious activity, appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes the class as a standard directive with URL support and schema features.\n- **Findings:** No external untrusted data, no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Verdict:** Clear, safe, and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, indicating the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly due to the attribute copying without validation, but not enough to consider a real security threat.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The code is a legitimate implementation of a custom GraphQL directive class, supporting schema composition and federation.\n- The only minor concern is the copying of attributes from an external object without validation, which could potentially be exploited if `self.graphene_directive` is compromised or manipulated. However, in typical usage, this pattern is common and safe.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minimal, mainly due to attribute copying without validation, but not a serious concern.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no malicious intent or malware detected. The low risk score reflects the minor concern about attribute copying, but overall, it is a standard, well-structured implementation.",
