  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes that the code is legitimate, schema-related, with no malicious intent. It notes the assertion on `spec_url` and the dynamic attribute copying as potential concerns but considers them safe in typical usage.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — very low, justified by minimal potential misuse (e.g., attribute copying).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is deemed benign, with no untrusted data handling, no suspicious patterns, and straightforward class setup.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate, given the lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the absence of issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Confirms the code's straightforward nature, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Also aligns with previous findings; standard class setup, no external data processing or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears to be a standard implementation of a custom GraphQL directive class, with proper parameter validation and attribute management.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected across all reports. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** Very low; mainly related to the `assert` on `spec_url` which is a standard validation, not a security flaw.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to account for the attribute copying without validation, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and safe for use.**",
