{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom GraphQL directive supporting federation and schema directives, with optional URL specification and attribute copying from an internal directive object.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters, self.graphene_directive.__dict__ for attribute copying",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or untrusted inputs; attribute copying is internal",
  "flows": "Attributes from self.graphene_directive.__dict__ are copied to the class instance during initialization",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic attribute copying without validation; assertion on spec_url when add_to_schema_directives is True",
  "analysis": "The code creates a class ComposableDirective extending GraphQLDirective, initializing with parameters and copying attributes from an internal CustomDirective instance. The assertion ensures spec_url is provided if schema directives are added. The attribute copying occurs from a known internal object, with no external data handling or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard schema directive patterns, with minimal security concern primarily around attribute copying without validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, schema-focused class for GraphQL directives with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The only minor concern is attribute copying without validation, which is typical in such contexts. Overall, it is safe for use.",
