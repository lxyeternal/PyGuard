{
  "purpose": "Define a custom GraphQL directive class that supports federation, schema directives, and URL specification.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes, reads function parameters, and accesses object attributes.",
  "sinks": "Uses parameters and object attributes to instantiate objects and set attributes; no evident sink for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Parameters are assigned to class attributes and used to instantiate a CustomDirective; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors; the code appears to follow standard patterns for defining a class and methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from GraphQLDirective, initializing it with various parameters, some of which include URL validation and optional schema directive addition. It uses imported modules to create a custom directive object and copies its attributes. No data is fetched from external sources, nor is any untrusted input processed or executed dynamically. The code is structured straightforwardly with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for a custom GraphQL directive with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is well-structured, with proper handling of parameters, and does not process external untrusted data maliciously.",
