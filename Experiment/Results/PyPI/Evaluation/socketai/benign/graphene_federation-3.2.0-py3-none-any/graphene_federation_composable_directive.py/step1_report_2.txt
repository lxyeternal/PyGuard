  "purpose": "Define a custom GraphQL directive class with optional schema integration features.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read untrusted input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data sinks or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily initializes and configures class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward class setup with no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'ComposableDirective' for creating GraphQL directives with optional schema-related parameters. It includes parameter validation (assert for spec_url) but no user input handling or external data processing. No use of dynamic execution, no network operations, no data leaks, and no suspicious behavior. The code is standard class initialization, documentation, and attribute copying. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured class for configuring GraphQL directives. No malicious intent, no malicious code, and no security risks identified.",
