  "purpose": "Define a custom GraphQL directive class with schema integration features.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing', 'graphene_directives', and 'graphql'; class initialization parameters; attribute copying from 'self.graphene_directive'.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of attributes; creation of 'CustomDirective'; call to superclass '__init__'; returning decorator function.",
  "flows": "Initialization parameters -> creation of 'CustomDirective' instance -> attribute copying -> superclass '__init__' -> decorator method returns a callable.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. The code mostly defines classes and manages attribute copying and directive creation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a class definition that extends 'GraphQLDirective' to create a composable directive with additional metadata. It imports necessary modules, constructs a custom directive, and sets attributes accordingly. No user input handling, external system interaction, or network calls are present. The purpose appears to be schema construction for GraphQL, with no signs of malicious activity. The only potential concern might be the assertion that 'spec_url' is not None, which is a standard check, not malicious. The decorator method simply returns a directive decorator. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class for defining custom GraphQL directives with schema support, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears safe and intended for schema construction purposes.",
