  "purpose": "Defines a decorator factory 'authenticated' for GraphQL schema elements, applying an 'authenticated' directive retrieved based on federation version.",
  "sources": "Retrieval of directive via 'get_directive_from_name' and application through 'directive_decorator'; use of 'is_non_field' to determine decoration method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or external input handling; no data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "Directive fetched from name and federation version -> decorator created -> applied to schema element based on 'is_non_field' check.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility for applying a GraphQL 'authenticated' directive to schema elements, using safe and well-understood patterns. No external data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The directive retrieval and application are safe given the context. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score should be 0, obfuscation score 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the dynamic directive fetching but not indicating any actual risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for schema decoration with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
