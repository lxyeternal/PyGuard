  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Malicious Indicators:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, importing known modules, and applying decorators for schema access control.\n   - No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n   - The code operates solely on schema elements, using directives retrieved via `get_directive_from_name` and applied through `directive_decorator`.\n   - No external untrusted input handling, network activity, or data leaks are evident.\n\n2. **Code Logic and Implementation:**\n   - The `authenticated` decorator factory correctly retrieves a directive based on name and federation version.\n   - It wraps schema elements (fields or types) conditionally, based on whether the element is a non-field (using `is_non_field`).\n   - The implementation is clean, modular, and follows standard patterns for schema directive decorators.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the clear, readable code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Very low (0.1), reflecting minimal potential for misuse—mainly due to the dynamic directive retrieval, which is standard and safe here.\n   - **Confidence Levels:** Ranging from 0.9 to 1, indicating high confidence that the code is benign and well-understood.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Misjudgments:**\n   - The only slight point is the dynamic retrieval of directives (`get_directive_from_name`) and application via decorators, which could, in theory, be misused if directives are manipulated. However, given the context and the lack of external input handling, this is not a security concern here.\n   - The reports correctly identify no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 is reasonable; it accounts for the minimal risk associated with dynamic directive handling but is not a concern here.\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, well-structured utility for schema directives with no security issues.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the detailed analysis above.",
