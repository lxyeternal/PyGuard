{
  "purpose": "Defines a decorator function 'authenticated' for GraphQL federation to indicate access restrictions based on authentication status.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing', 'graphene_directives', 'graphene_federation.apollo_versions', and local utils; calls to 'get_directive_from_name'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'get_directive_from_name' and 'directive_decorator' which may load directives dynamically; no evidence of untrusted data handling or malicious sink functions.",
  "flows": "Calls 'get_directive_from_name' to fetch directive, then applies 'directive_decorator' to decorate GraphQL fields or types; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors; the code mainly handles decorator logic and directive fetching.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a decorator for GraphQL federation directives, utilizing dynamic directive retrieval based on name and version. It uses standard Python practices, no external or untrusted input handling, or suspicious code patterns. The functions rely on imported modules and local utils. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security flaws within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for GraphQL federation with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a straightforward implementation of a directive decorator with no suspicious behavior.",
