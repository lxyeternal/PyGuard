{
  "purpose": "Define a decorator for marking GraphQL schema elements as accessible only to authenticated users using federation directives.",
  "sources": "import statements; get_directive_from_name function call; is_non_field function call",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code primarily constructs and returns decorators, does not process untrusted input directly",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code retrieves directives and wraps fields/types with decorators",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a decorator 'authenticated' that retrieves a federation directive and creates a decorator using 'directive_decorator'. It conditionally applies the decorator to fields or types based on 'is_non_field'. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for GraphQL schema annotation, with no data manipulation, network operations, or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a schema annotation utility with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured code for GraphQL federation directive handling.",
