  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any security concerns are justified.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code defines a decorator factory `authenticated` that fetches a GraphQL directive and applies it to schema elements.\n- It uses `get_directive_from_name` and `directive_decorator` to obtain and apply directives.\n- The utility `is_non_field` determines how to decorate schema elements.\n- No external data is processed, no network or file I/O, and no suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### **Individual Report Review**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Define a custom GraphQL directive for access control.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** The security risk score is very low, indicating minimal concern, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1—define a decorator for access control.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious behavior, no external threats.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0\n- **Justification:** No security risks or malware present; the code is a utility function.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Define a decorator for a GraphQL directive.\n- **Assessment:** Straightforward, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0\n- **Justification:** No external data or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Decorator for GraphQL federation directives.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0\n- **Justification:** No external threats or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Utility for GraphQL federation directives.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** The slight security risk score might reflect the dynamic directive retrieval, but given the code's context, this is minimal and acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, with scores at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation, with scores at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low across all, mostly 0 or 0.1, which is appropriate given the utility nature of the code.\n\n### **My Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very minimal, possibly due to dynamic directive retrieval, but not concerning)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and appropriately scored. No modifications or escalations are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured utility for applying GraphQL federation directives, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores reflect this accurately.",
