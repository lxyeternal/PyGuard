  "purpose": "Define a custom GraphQL directive 'authenticated' for access control in a federated GraphQL schema.",
  "sources": "Import statements, get_directive_from_name function, and is_non_field utility",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling; decorators are used for schema manipulation, not data processing",
  "flows": "The directive fetched by get_directive_from_name flows into the decorator, which is then applied to GraphQL schema elements",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present; no obfuscated code or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a decorator factory 'authenticated' that creates a GraphQL directive for access control. It uses 'get_directive_from_name' to fetch a directive object, then wraps schema elements with a decorator. The function supports optional application to a type directly or as a decorator. The utility 'is_non_field' helps determine how to apply the decorator. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. No external untrusted inputs are processed, and the code is structured for schema modification.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a schema directive for access control without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured schema utility function.",
