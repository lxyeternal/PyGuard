{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python decorator for GraphQL federation directives, specifically the 'authenticated' directive, to control access to GraphQL schema elements.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters ('graphene_type', 'federation_version'), and calls external functions such as 'get_directive_from_name' and 'directive_decorator'.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the application of the 'decorator' to GraphQL schema elements (fields or types). No data is sent or leaked externally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to retrieve a directive, which is then decorated onto GraphQL schema elements, creating a flow from input parameters to decorator application.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code mainly handles decorator creation and application, with no network or system operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports external modules to obtain a GraphQL directive and apply decorators to schema elements, based on whether the input is a field or type. The 'authenticated' directive is used to restrict access. The implementation appears straightforward, without obfuscated code or malicious logic. No external data handling or suspicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a GraphQL directive decorator for authentication purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for schema access control.",
