  "obfuscated": 0,

  "conclusion": "Based on the reports, there is no definitive evidence of malicious code or obfuscation. However, patterns such as dynamic execution and obfuscation hints justify a moderate risk level. The malware score remains at 0, but the security risk should be increased from 0.2 to approximately 0.4, and the malware suspicion adjusted from 0 to around 0.4 to better align with the described patterns. The overall threat remains low but warrants cautious monitoring."
