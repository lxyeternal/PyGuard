  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured CLI utility for managing a ZiGate device. It contains no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The potential misuse of the testing loop is minimal and not malicious. The security risk is very low, primarily due to the testing feature, but this does not constitute a security concern. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
