{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'setuptools' module and calls 'setuptools.setup()' within the main block.",
  "sinks": "The 'setuptools.setup()' function acts as a sink, but it is a standard setup function for packaging and does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'setuptools' to executing 'setuptools.setup()' if run as the main module.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is minimal and follows a common pattern for package setup.",
  "analysis": "This script simply imports the 'setuptools' library and invokes its 'setup()' function when executed directly. It does not process user input, environment variables, or untrusted data. The use of 'setuptools.setup()' is standard in Python packaging scripts. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical minimal setup script for Python packages with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues.",
