  "purpose": "This code is intended to set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'setuptools' library and the '__main__' module to initiate setup.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in this code that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setuptools.setup()' when executed as the main program.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are present. The code performs a standard package setup process.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library, which is a common package for building and distributing Python projects. When run directly, it executes 'setuptools.setup()', which is typical for setup scripts. There are no inputs, data leaks, or malicious instructions. No obfuscation or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
