  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'setuptools' module and uses it to run setup() when executed as the main program.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sources are used; no sinks that process untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script simply calls setuptools.setup() without any data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for a setup script. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setuptools' library and invokes its setup() function if executed directly. This is a typical pattern for Python package setup scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The code does not perform any network operations, data collection, or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
