  "purpose": "Standard Python packaging setup script using setuptools",
  "sources": "Import of setuptools module, call to setuptools.setup() within __main__ guard",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external inputs, or dynamic code execution present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code executes only standard setup call",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, well-known pattern for Python package setup. It imports setuptools and calls setup() when run directly. No dynamic input, external data, or malicious constructs are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign with no security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The security assessment and scores are accurate and require no modification.",
