{
  "purpose": "The code is used to configure and initiate the setup process for a Python package distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'setuptools' module import and the '__main__' conditional.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or input is processed or passed to sensitive functions.",
  "flows": "Import of 'setuptools' -> execution of 'setuptools.setup()' if run as main script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; the code is minimal and standard for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls its 'setup()' function within a main guard. This is typical in Python packaging scripts to define package metadata and configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The script performs a common, legitimate function for packaging Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
