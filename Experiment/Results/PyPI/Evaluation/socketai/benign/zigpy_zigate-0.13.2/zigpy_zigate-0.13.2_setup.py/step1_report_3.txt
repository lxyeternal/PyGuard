  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; script simply calls setuptools.setup() when executed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script that invokes setuptools.setup() if run as the main program. It contains no malicious logic, data handling, or suspicious behaviors. The use of setuptools is standard for Python packaging and does not indicate malicious intent. The code does not include any dynamic execution, external data, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python packaging setup file with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
