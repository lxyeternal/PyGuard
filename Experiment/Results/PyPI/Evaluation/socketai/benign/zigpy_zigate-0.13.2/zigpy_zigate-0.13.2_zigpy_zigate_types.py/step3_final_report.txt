  "purpose": "Serialization and deserialization of Zigbee protocol data types for data exchange and processing.",
  "sources": "Input byte streams during deserialization, structured data during serialization",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures, no external I/O or network activity",
  "flows": "Byte streams into structured objects via deserialize methods; structured data into byte sequences via serialize methods",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; protocol-specific byte reversal in EUI64 is standard, not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard serialization/deserialization routines for Zigbee data types, including enums, integers, byte arrays, and custom structures. It performs length checks and type handling appropriately. No external system calls, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The deserialization functions handle untrusted data safely within the scope of the code, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious payloads. The code aligns with typical protocol handling libraries and follows best practices for data parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured serialization/deserialization library for Zigbee protocol data types. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified, considering the inherent risks of deserializing untrusted data, but no actual vulnerabilities are evident.",
