  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for verifying dataset metadata in the vega_datasets package.",
  "sources": "The code reads dataset attributes such as description, filepath, and references from the vega_datasets module.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "The code accesses dataset attributes, performs assertions, and raises exceptions based on dataset properties.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code performs standard testing operations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports testing frameworks and the vega_datasets package. It lists datasets and checks their attributes for correctness. No external data inputs or network operations are involved. The assertions are straightforward and related to dataset metadata validation. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious behavior. The code is a typical test script verifying data attributes with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite validating dataset metadata from the vega_datasets package. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
