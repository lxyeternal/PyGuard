{
  "purpose": "The code provides a data loading framework for various datasets from the vega_datasets package, allowing users to load datasets either locally or from remote URLs, and parse them into pandas DataFrames or other formats.",
  "sources": "Package data files loaded via pkgutil.get_data, dataset URLs fetched via urlopen, and user inputs via function parameters such as dataset names and options.",
  "sinks": "Data fetched from URLs and package resources, processed into pandas objects or raw bytes, returned to the user; no evident data leaks or sensitive information handling.",
  "flows": "Dataset info loaded via pkgutil.get_data (source), then URLs or local files accessed (sink), and data parsed into DataFrames or other structures, returned to user functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No unexpected network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data loaders and dataset class definitions with methods for fetching, parsing, and returning datasets. It uses standard libraries (json, os, urllib, pandas) and open-source package management (pkgutil). The URL access is controlled and only retrieves data related to predefined datasets. The data loading process is transparent, and no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external script execution is present. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious data flows, or malicious commands are detected. The implementation adheres to typical data processing patterns with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign dataset loader for vega_datasets, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It safely loads datasets from known URLs or local files, parses them into pandas objects, and offers a clean API for users. The overall security risk is very low.",
