  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent dataset loader with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by external URL access from trusted sources. No modifications are necessary; the code is safe for use in production environments."
