  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for the 'vega_datasets' package.\n- They confirm that the code only reads static files (README.md, __init__.py) and uses standard library functions.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is observed.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The version extraction via regex from __init__.py is a common practice.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, indicating no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. The code is benign and typical for a setup script.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or security risks:** None detected.\n- **Code logic:** Straightforward file reads and setup configuration.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The scores given are consistent with the analysis. Since all reports agree on the benign nature, I concur with their assessments.\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; the code is clear and readable.\n- The overall security risk score of 0 aligns with the lack of vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Additional Observations:\n- The regex for version extraction is simple and safe.\n- The use of static strings and local files for metadata is standard.\n- No external inputs or network calls are involved.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- Given the comprehensive agreement among reports and the code's straightforward nature, I would assign the following scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, standard, and secure nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, well-structured setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and I agree with their conclusions.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the package setup code is safe.",
