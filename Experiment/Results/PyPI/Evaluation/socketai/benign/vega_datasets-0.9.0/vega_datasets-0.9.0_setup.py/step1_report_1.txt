{
  "purpose": "The code is used to configure the packaging and distribution of a Python dataset package named 'vega_datasets'.",
  "sources": "File reading functions (read and version), reading README.md, __init__.py for version string, package_data files, environment variables are not used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or code injection; no network or system command execution is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (e.g., README.md, __init__.py) into variables used in setup(). No untrusted data flows to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file reading and setup configuration for packaging a Python project. The version is extracted via regex from a local file, which is a common practice. All other data (author info, URLs, dependencies) are static strings. The code uses standard library functions and setuptools APIs without any suspicious modifications or obfuscations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
