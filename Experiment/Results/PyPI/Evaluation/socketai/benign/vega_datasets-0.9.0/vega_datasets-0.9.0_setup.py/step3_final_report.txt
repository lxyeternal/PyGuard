  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'vega_datasets' Python library, reading static files for metadata and version info.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and '__init__.py' files for description and version; static data access.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution, network calls, or user input handling.",
  "flows": "Reading files to obtain description and version; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and follows common packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static file reads, regex-based version extraction, and setup configuration with no suspicious or malicious patterns. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no obfuscation, dynamic code, or network activity. All signals indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign Python package setup file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assess it as safe, assigning malware and security risk scores of 0. The code's clarity and static nature confirm its safety.",
