{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python dataset package named 'vega_datasets'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string from a specified file and reads the README.md for long description; it also gathers package data files.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data; no sinks involving external systems or sensitive data processing.",
  "flows": "The version function reads a version string from a file; setup uses this version. No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code follows standard setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup configuration for a Python package, including reading version info from a file and package metadata. The use of regex to extract version string is standard. No suspicious code, obfuscated segments, or malicious patterns are detected. The code avoids dynamic execution or external data manipulation beyond standard setup routines. All functions and data handling are benign and typical for packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected. It follows normal packaging practices without suspicious or malicious constructs.",
