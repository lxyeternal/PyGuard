  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code to identify any discrepancies, potential issues, or inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes that the code performs straightforward file reads, version extraction via regex, and static data usage. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are present.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code, which uses standard practices without dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard setup script with no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code reads static files, extracts version info via regex, and uses setuptools normally. No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-founded.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard packaging setup with no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code's logic is consistent with a typical setup script. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others—benign, standard setup script.\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is a straightforward setup script. It reads files, extracts version info, and configures packaging. All operations are static and standard.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- **Security risk:** None detected; the code does not perform any dangerous operations, network activity, or handle untrusted input.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the consistency across all reports and the code, I concur with the assessments. The scores of malware, obfuscated code, and security risk should all be **0**.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The regex used to extract the version is standard and safe.\n- No dynamic code execution or external data manipulation occurs.\n- The code is a typical setup script for a Python package.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                      |\n| Security Risk  | 0                      |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
