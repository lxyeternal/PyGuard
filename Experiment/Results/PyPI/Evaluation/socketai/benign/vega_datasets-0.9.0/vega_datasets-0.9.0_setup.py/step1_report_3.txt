  "purpose": "This script configures the setup and distribution parameters for the Python package 'vega_datasets'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package version info from a file, long description from README.md, and other metadata from static strings and files.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows from untrusted sources; the code primarily reads static files and sets up package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file, reads long description from README.md, and uses static strings for package info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. Uses standard setup tools with no dynamic or insecure code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines functions to read files and extract version info via regex, and calls setup() with package metadata. All data sources are static or from known files. No user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. The code follows typical Python package setup practices without any suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a standard package configuration with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks identified.",
