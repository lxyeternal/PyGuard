{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'vega_datasets', used for packaging and distribution purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading the package version from '__init__.py', reading 'README.md' for long description, and accessing package files listed in 'package_data'.",
  "sinks": "None of the code involves execution of untrusted input, system calls, or network activities that could be exploited as data sinks.",
  "flows": "The code reads static files (version, README, package data) to gather metadata; no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns are present. The code uses standard setup procedures; no obfuscated or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration for packaging. It retrieves the version number via regex from a local file, reads static files for description, and specifies package data and metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior is observed. The code structure is typical for setup scripts and does not involve any malicious intent or potentially harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign setup script used for packaging a Python library. It contains no malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It is a standard and safe implementation.",
