  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, data flows, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, imported modules, data reads from files or network, subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, subprocess executions, environment variable access, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like network sockets, files, or subprocesses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious dynamic code, or backdoors detected; incomplete code in some reports warrants caution.",
  "analysis": "All reports describe standard or limited code snippets with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. Confidence levels vary based on detail, with scores appropriately low for benign code. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are identified. Slightly increased risk scores could be justified for incomplete or uncertain code, but current low scores are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign across all reports, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, though a cautious approach suggests marginally increasing risk scores for uncertain cases. Overall, the supply chain security posture is acceptable, with scores aligned to the evidence.",
