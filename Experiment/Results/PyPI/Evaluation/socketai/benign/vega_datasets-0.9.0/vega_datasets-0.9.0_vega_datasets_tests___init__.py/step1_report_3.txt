{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a standard Python module possibly intended for general use or specific functionality based on imported modules.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, possibly user input, and imported modules which could include external data if they perform data fetching or network communication.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, subprocess calls, or data serialization/deserialization that could be misused for data exfiltration or command execution.",
  "flows": "Data may flow from environment variables or external inputs through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks like network or file system operations without proper validation.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are detected. The code appears straightforward, but further detailed inspection of imported modules is needed for confirmation.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly for typical malicious indicators. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, suspicious network requests, or obfuscated segments. The structure is clear, and third-party library use is standard. No backdoors or malicious payloads are evident. Without seeing the specific content of imported modules, the risk remains minimal, but the overall code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The code appears to be a standard, benign Python script or module. However, complete confidence depends on inspecting imported modules and any runtime behaviors.",
