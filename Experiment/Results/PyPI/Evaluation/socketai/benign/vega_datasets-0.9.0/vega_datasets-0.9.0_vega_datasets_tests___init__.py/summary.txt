  "conclusion": "The code appears benign across all reports, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, though a cautious approach suggests marginally increasing risk scores for uncertain cases. Overall, the supply chain security posture is acceptable, with scores aligned to the evidence."
