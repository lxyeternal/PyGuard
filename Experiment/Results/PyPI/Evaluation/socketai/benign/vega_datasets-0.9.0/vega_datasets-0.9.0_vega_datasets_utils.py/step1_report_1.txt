  "purpose": "The code checks for internet connectivity by attempting to open a URL associated with the vega_datasets library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from Dataset.base_url using urlopen.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only performs a network request to test connectivity.",
  "flows": "The source (urlopen) attempts to access Dataset.base_url and returns a boolean indicating connection status.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; the code performs a straightforward connectivity check without obfuscated or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a function to check internet connectivity by attempting to open a URL. It handles HTTPError (expected if no index page exists) and URLError (no internet). No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are involved. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present. The logic is simple and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for connectivity checking with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
