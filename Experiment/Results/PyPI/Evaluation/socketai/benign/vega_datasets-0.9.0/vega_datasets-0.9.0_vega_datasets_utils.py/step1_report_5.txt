  "purpose": "Check web connectivity to the vega_datasets core URL to verify internet access and dataset availability.",
  "sources": "The urlopen function reading from Dataset.base_url.",
  "sinks": "None observed; the code only reads data from a URL without writing or executing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "urlopen is called with Dataset.base_url; no data is processed further.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a straightforward connectivity check.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Dataset to access its base_url, then defines a function to verify internet connectivity by attempting to open the URL. It handles HTTPError by returning True, assuming a 404 is acceptable, and handles URLError by returning False. The logic is simple and standard for connectivity checks, with no malicious or suspicious behavior observed. No input is taken from untrusted sources beyond the URL request, and no data is leaked or malicious actions are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic network connectivity check without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign utility function.",
