  "purpose": "Perform a connectivity check by attempting to open Dataset.base_url to verify internet access.",
  "sources": "Reading Dataset.base_url for URL access.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; only network request to check URL reachability.",
  "flows": "urlopen(Dataset.base_url) with error handling determines connectivity status.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward network request with expected error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to open a URL to verify internet connectivity, treating HTTP 404 errors as success since the server is reachable, and URLError as failure. It does not process user input, handle sensitive data, or perform malicious actions. The code is simple, clear, and performs a benign network check. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign behavior. The slight security risk score of 0.1 could be lowered to 0, but it remains acceptable as is.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward connectivity check with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further modifications are necessary.",
