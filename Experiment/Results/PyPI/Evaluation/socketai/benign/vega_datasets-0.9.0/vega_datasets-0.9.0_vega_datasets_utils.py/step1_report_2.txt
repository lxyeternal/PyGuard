  "purpose": "The code checks internet connectivity by attempting to open a URL from the vega_datasets library.",
  "sources": "The URL from Dataset.base_url accessed via urlopen.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code only performs a connectivity check without handling or transmitting untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The function attempts to connect to Dataset.base_url; success or failure determines the return value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward connectivity check with exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for HTTP requests and error handling. The function connection_ok() tries to open the base URL from vega_datasets. It considers HTTP errors like 404 as a successful connection since the server is reachable, and only treats URLError as a lack of internet. No user input, sensitive data, or malicious behavior is present. The logic is simple and intended for connectivity verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign connectivity check without malicious intent or security risks. No suspicious behavior detected.",
