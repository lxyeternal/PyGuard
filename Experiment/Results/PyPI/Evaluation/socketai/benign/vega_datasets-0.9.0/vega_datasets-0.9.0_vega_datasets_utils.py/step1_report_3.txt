{
  "purpose": "The code checks the availability of a web connection by attempting to open a URL derived from the vega_datasets library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the value of Dataset.base_url to attempt a URL connection.",
  "targets": "The urlopen function attempts to connect to the URL, which could potentially lead to data leakage if the URL contains sensitive information, but in this case it is a dataset URL.",
  "flows": "The function tries to open Dataset.base_url; on success or a 404 error, it returns True; on network errors, it returns False.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code handles expected HTTP errors normally.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a dataset URL and attempts to open it to check internet connectivity. It handles HTTPError (such as 404) as a positive indicator of network availability, and URLError indicates no internet connection. The logic is straightforward and does not perform any malicious actions. There are no suspicious data flows, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple network connectivity check with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
