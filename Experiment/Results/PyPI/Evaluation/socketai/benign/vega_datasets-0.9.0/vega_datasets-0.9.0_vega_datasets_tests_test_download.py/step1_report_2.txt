{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test functions designed to verify the functionality of the vega_datasets package, ensuring data can be downloaded, parsed, and loaded correctly.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the vega_datasets package functions such as data.iris, data.stocks, data.miserables, data.us_10m, data.world_110m, data.unemployment, data.zipcodes, and the connection_ok utility function.",
  "sinks": "The data functions return data either as DataFrames, bytes, or dicts. No sinks appear to process untrusted input directly; all data sources are from the package or external servers tested with a connectivity check.",
  "flows": "The source functions call external data sources (via network or local files). The data is loaded into memory as DataFrames, bytes, or dicts, with no further processing that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of pytest for testing and the data functions is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for a dataset package, relying on network checks and data loading functions. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. It uses standard libraries and functions. No hardcoded credentials, network communications beyond dataset fetching, or dangerous operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test suite for dataset loading with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It only accesses external datasets with proper connectivity checks and uses standard Python testing practices.",
