  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of pytest functions testing data loading from the 'vega_datasets' package.\n- Data is fetched over the internet, with connectivity checks to avoid failures.\n- No data is written, transmitted, or executed in an insecure or suspicious manner.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The code uses standard libraries and practices.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores**\n\n#### **Malware Score:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, citing no malicious activity.\n- The code only performs data fetching and assertions; no suspicious network activity, code injection, or malicious payloads are present.\n- **Conclusion:** The malware score should remain **0.0**.\n\n#### **Obfuscated Score:**\n- All reports assign 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The code is straightforward, readable, and standard.\n- **Conclusion:** The obfuscated score should remain **0.0**.\n\n#### **Risk Score:**\n- The risk score reflects the potential security impact.\n- The code is a test suite, not executing untrusted code or handling sensitive data.\n- It relies on external datasets, but with proper connectivity checks.\n- The only potential concern could be the reliance on external data sources, but this is typical for such tests.\n- The reports assign low risk scores (0.0 or 0.1), which seems appropriate.\n- **Justification for higher scores:** Only if the code executed untrusted input or had vulnerabilities, which it does not.\n\n---\n\n### **Specific points per report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Fully confident (1.0).\n- No anomalies, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Slightly less confident (0.9), mentions a security risk of 0.1.\n- The only reason for a minimal risk score could be the external data fetching.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1 — acceptable, given the context.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Fully confident (1.0).\n- Similar reasoning; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly less confident (0.9), risk score 0.\n- No issues detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Fully confident (1.0).\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|---------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| 1       | 0.0             | 0.0               | 0.0        |\n| 2       | 0.0             | 0.0               | 0.1        |\n| 3       | 0.0             | 0.0               | 0.1        |\n| 4       | 0.0             | 0.0               | 0.0        |\n| 5       | 0.0             | 0.0               | 0.0        |\n\n**Overall:** The code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified by the external data fetching, which is typical for testing data loading functions.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes to the scores are necessary based on the provided analysis. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and security implications.",
