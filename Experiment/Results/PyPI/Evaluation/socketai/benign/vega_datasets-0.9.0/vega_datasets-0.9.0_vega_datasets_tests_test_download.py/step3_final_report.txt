  "purpose": "A set of pytest functions testing data loading and validation from the vega_datasets package, with internet connectivity checks.",
  "sources": "Data fetching functions such as data.iris(), data.stocks(), data.miserables(), data.us_10m(), data.world_110m(), data.unemployment(), data.zipcodes(), which read data over the network.",
  "sinks": "Assertions on data types, columns, and structures; no data is transmitted or written elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Data is fetched from external sources via the data module functions, then validated through assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for data loading functions, performing data type and structure assertions. It uses connectivity checks to avoid failures. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The code relies on trusted libraries and standard practices. External data fetching is managed via connectivity checks, which is common and safe in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is justified by reliance on external data sources, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity are present.",
