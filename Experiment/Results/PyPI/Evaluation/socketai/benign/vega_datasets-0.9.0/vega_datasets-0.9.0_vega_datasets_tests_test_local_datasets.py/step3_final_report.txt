{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the vega_datasets package, verifying dataset loading, data integrity, column names, data types, and raw byte outputs.",
  "sources": "Dataset listing functions, dataset loading functions, and raw data retrieval methods within the vega_datasets package.",
  "sinks": "Comparison assertions and data type checks; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from internal sources, compared for equality, and raw bytes are retrieved; no external data flows or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs internal dataset validation using trusted libraries and functions. It does not process external input, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. All operations are standard testing routines, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard dataset validation test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The scores should remain at zero across all categories, aligning with the assessments provided.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
