  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard test suite for the vega_datasets package.\n- No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or external data flows are identified.\n- The code performs dataset loading, comparison, and validation within a controlled environment.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is also 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- The security risk score is 0 across all reports, which is reasonable given the context.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The code only interacts with internal datasets and performs benign assertions.\n- No evidence suggests any hidden malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- The reports are thorough and consistent in their assessment.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- Malware: 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is evident.\n- Obfuscated: 0 is appropriate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Risk: 0 is justified; the code does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- All reports are accurate in their evaluation.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n- The code is safe, with no security risks or malware.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are consistent and correct. The code is a standard, benign test suite with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and it poses no security risks.",
