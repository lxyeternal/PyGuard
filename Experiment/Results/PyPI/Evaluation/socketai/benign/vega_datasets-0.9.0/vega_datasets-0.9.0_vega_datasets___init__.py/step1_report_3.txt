{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes from the vega_datasets.core module and initializes two instances of these classes, likely for data loading purposes. It also sets a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement from vega_datasets.core; initialization of DataLoader() and LocalDataLoader() instances; assignment of __version__ variable",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations",
  "flows": "Import leads to class definitions; instances are created but not used further; no data flows to external systems",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed; straightforward import and instantiation",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of dataset loader classes and creates instances without any additional logic. The __version__ variable is assigned a string value. No data input handling, no external network communication, and no suspicious operations are present. The code appears to be standard setup code for data loading without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as part of a data loading setup. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
