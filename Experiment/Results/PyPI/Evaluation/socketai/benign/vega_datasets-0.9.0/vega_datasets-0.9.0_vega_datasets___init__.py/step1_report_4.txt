{
  "purpose": "The code imports data loader classes from the vega_datasets package and initializes instances of these classes, likely for data loading purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package's import statements and the assignment of DataLoader() and LocalDataLoader() instances.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network communications, file writes, or system modifications that could lead to data leaks or system harm.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported classes to the instantiated objects; no further data flow paths are evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports two classes from an external package and creates instances of those classes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or malicious code execution. The assignment of a version string is standard and does not indicate any malicious intent. No external network communication, file manipulation, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing standard import and object instantiation tasks without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
