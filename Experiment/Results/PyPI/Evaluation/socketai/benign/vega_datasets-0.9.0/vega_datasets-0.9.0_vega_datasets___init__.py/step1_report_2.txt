{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes DataLoader and LocalDataLoader from the vega_datasets.core package and creates instances of these classes. It also defines a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing classes from an external package; assignment of instances to variables; assignment of version string",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external communications",
  "flows": "The data flows from imported classes to instantiated objects; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are evident",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard import and object instantiation from a known open-source package. The version string is a typical package version declaration. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious behavior, or malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign import and initialization snippet for datasets, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
