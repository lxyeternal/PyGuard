  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the reported issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as importing classes from `vega_datasets.core` and instantiating them.\n- The code includes a `__version__` string.\n- No data is processed, transmitted, or stored.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The code appears to be a standard setup for dataset loading.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Checks:\n\n**Code correctness:**  \n- The code matches the description: import classes and instantiate objects.  \n- The `__version__` string is a common pattern for package versioning.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n**Malware presence:**  \n- No evidence of malicious activity, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.  \n- The code is benign.\n\n**Obfuscation:**  \n- The code is straightforward; no obfuscation patterns are present.\n\n**Security risk:**  \n- Given the benign nature, no security risks are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Issue-specific analysis:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- All describe the code as benign, standard, and without malicious indicators.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable.\n- The malware scores are 0, aligning with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- The security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Any adjustments needed?**  \n- The scores seem appropriate given the code.  \n- The only point to consider is whether the risk score should be slightly above 0.1 due to the presence of a version string, but that is standard and not risky.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct, code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct, no security risk)\n\n**However,** since all reports are consistent and the code is trivial, I agree with their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple import and instantiation pattern, typical for setup scripts, with no suspicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and carries no security concerns.",
