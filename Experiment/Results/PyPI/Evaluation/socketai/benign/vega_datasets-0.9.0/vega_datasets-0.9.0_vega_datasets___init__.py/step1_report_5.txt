{
  "purpose": "The code imports data loader classes from the vega_datasets library and initializes instances of these classes, likely to load dataset resources.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'vega_datasets.core'; assignment to 'data' and 'local_data' variables",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data processing, system calls, or data leaks are present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; imports and object instantiations are straightforward",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures; version string is harmless",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes designed for dataset handling, creates instances of these classes, and sets a version string. No user input, network communication, or file operations are evident. The code appears to be a simple dataset loader setup without any malicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, performing standard library imports and object initializations related to data loading. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security risks.",
