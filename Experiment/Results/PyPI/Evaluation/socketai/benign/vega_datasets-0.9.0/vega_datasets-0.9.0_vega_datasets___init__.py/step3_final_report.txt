{
  "purpose": "The code imports dataset loader classes from an open-source package and creates instances, serving as a setup for data handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from vega_datasets.core, instantiation of DataLoader and LocalDataLoader, assignment of __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "No data flows to external systems, no network or file operations, no untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "Import source to object instantiation; no external data flow or untrusted sink involved.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code; straightforward and standard code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple imports and object creation with a version string, typical for setup scripts. No data processing, external communication, or suspicious behavior is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of zero, with high confidence. No anomalies or security concerns are evident, and the code's simplicity aligns with a safe, standard pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores and assessments in all reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
