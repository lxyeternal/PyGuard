{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes from the vega_datasets.core module and initializes instances of these classes, likely for loading datasets.",
  "sources": "Import statement from vega_datasets.core; instantiation of DataLoader and LocalDataLoader objects",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in the code",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code merely initializes objects without processing or transmitting data",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an __version__ string is typical for package metadata; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes and creates instances, which is standard practice for dataset loading modules. No suspicious or malicious actions are evident. The version string is a common attribute indicating package version. There are no unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs straightforward imports and object instantiations for dataset loading without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
