  "purpose": "Test suite verifying error handling for invalid dataset names in the vega_datasets library.",
  "sources": "Functions `data()`, `local_data()`, and `Dataset._infodict()` invoked with invalid dataset names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external outputs; exception messages are standard and do not leak sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Input dataset names → function calls → exception raising with specific messages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite that checks for proper exception handling when invalid dataset names are used. It does not perform any external system interactions, data exfiltration, or malicious actions. The exception messages are standard and do not leak sensitive data. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The functions tested are internal API calls that validate dataset existence, and the tests only verify error responses. The scores assigned (malware 0, securityRisk 0, obfuscated 0) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, conventional test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code and assign appropriate scores. No adjustments are necessary.",
