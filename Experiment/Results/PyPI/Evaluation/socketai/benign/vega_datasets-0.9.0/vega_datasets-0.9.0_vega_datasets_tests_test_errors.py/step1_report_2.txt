{
  "purpose": "This code is a set of test functions for validating dataset access and error handling in the vega_datasets library.",
  "sources": "The code reads dataset names via function calls like data(), local_data(), and Dataset._infodict(), and parameterizes dataset names for tests.",
  "sinks": "The code raises exceptions with specific messages, but no direct data leaks or untrusted data flows are evident. No external data is fetched or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input dataset names from parameters or function calls are validated and used within exception handling, with no evident flow leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors. The code appears straightforward, focused on testing.",
  "analysis": "The script imports testing libraries and the vega_datasets package, then defines test functions that verify correct error handling for invalid dataset names. It uses parameterized tests to check datasets not available locally. The code primarily raises and asserts exception messages, with no untrusted input being processed insecurely or malicious code execution observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for dataset validation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. The likelihood of malware or security threats is extremely low.",
