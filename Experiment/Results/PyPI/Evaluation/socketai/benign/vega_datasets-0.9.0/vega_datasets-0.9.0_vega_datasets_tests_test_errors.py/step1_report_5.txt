{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the vega_datasets Python package, verifying dataset access and error handling.",
  "sources": "Input data is implicitly read from function calls such as data(), local_data(), and Dataset methods.",
  "targets": "Exception handling and assertions verify that proper errors are raised for invalid dataset names.",
  "flows": "Input dataset name -> function call -> error handling -> exception raised and caught in tests.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs standard testing routines with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a dataset library and uses pytest to verify dataset error handling for undefined datasets and dataset listing errors. It raises exceptions if invalid dataset names are used, which is expected behavior. There is no indication of data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity. The code appears to be straightforward test cases designed to validate proper error handling within the dataset library. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for a dataset library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions to ensure proper exception handling when datasets are not found, with no malicious or suspicious behavior observed.",
