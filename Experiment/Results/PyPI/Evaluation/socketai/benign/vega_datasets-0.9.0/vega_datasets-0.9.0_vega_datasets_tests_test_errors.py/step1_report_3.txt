{
  "purpose": "The code tests the behavior of dataset retrieval functions in the vega_datasets package, specifically handling undefined datasets and error conditions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the dataset name strings passed to functions like data(), local_data(), and Dataset._infodict().",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include error messages generated by exceptions, which could be exploited if crafted input triggers unintended behavior, but there are no explicit sinks like network calls or file writes.",
  "flows": "Input dataset name strings flow into functions and trigger exception handling; no untrusted data flows into external systems or sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code primarily handles exceptions and parameterized tests.",
  "analysis": "The code defines test functions that invoke dataset-related functions with invalid dataset names to ensure proper exception handling. It verifies that appropriate exceptions are raised with correct messages. The code uses pytest for testing and parameterizes tests to cover multiple cases. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The exception handling is standard and does not involve external communication, environment variables, or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard unit testing for dataset functions with invalid inputs. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscated code. It appears safe and typical for testing error handling in a Python package.",
