  "purpose": "Verify that dataset attribute names in 'data' and 'local_data' modules match the dataset names listed by their respective functions, ensuring naming consistency within the 'vega_datasets' package.",
  "sources": "The functions 'data.list_datasets()' and 'Dataset.list_local_datasets()' providing dataset names; 'dir(data)' and 'dir(local_data)' retrieving module attribute names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only performs internal attribute and list comparisons without external data flow.",
  "flows": "Dataset names from listing functions flow into set operations; attribute names from modules are compared against these sets to verify consistency.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs straightforward attribute listing and comparison without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports dataset modules and defines two test functions that compare module attribute names with dataset names obtained from listing functions, replacing hyphens with underscores for consistency. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The logic is simple and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The purpose is to verify naming consistency, a benign operation. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), and the code shows no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward test verifying dataset naming conventions within the 'vega_datasets' package. It poses no security threat, contains no malware or obfuscation, and the current scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
