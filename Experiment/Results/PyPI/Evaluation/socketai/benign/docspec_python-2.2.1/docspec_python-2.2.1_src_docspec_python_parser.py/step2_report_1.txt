  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as a Python parser and analyzer, which is correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of dangerous data flows; data flows are confined to parsing and data extraction.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or sabotage detected. The code uses standard libraries (`lib2to3`, `blib2to3`) and performs static analysis without executing code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is legitimate with a high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, obfuscated 0, security risk very low.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound, and the conclusion aligns with the code's static, non-executive nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a static analysis tool for Python code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No active data exfiltration or malicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns; uses standard parsing and string handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-reasoned, high confidence (0.95). Malware is 0, obfuscated 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is consistent; no suspicious activity is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a parser converting source into an internal model.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No execution or network activity; only AST processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, with full confidence (1.0). Malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is solid; the code is purely static analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately states the code's role as a parser and analyzer.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous data handling or execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns; standard parsing.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct, high confidence (1.0). Malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly identified as benign static analysis code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a static parser extracting code structure.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Notes the use of `ast.literal_eval` in `prepare_docstring`. While `literal_eval` is safe (evaluates only literals), the report considers this operation as potentially risky if misused.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or obfuscation; the use of `literal_eval` is safe here, only processing string literals.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly more cautious but still reasonable; the code is safe in context. Malware score 0, obfuscated 0, security risk very low.\n\n**Assessment:** The concern about `literal_eval` is overly cautious; in this context, it is safe and standard for processing docstrings.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a static parser and analyzer, not executing code or transmitting data.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All scores are zero, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Potential Risks:** The only operation that could be misused is `ast.literal_eval`, but in this context, it only evaluates string literals, which is safe.\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the static nature and lack of dangerous operations, a low risk score is appropriate, e.g., **0.1** or **0.2**.\n\n**Note:** The reports are consistent and justified. The code appears to be a legitimate static analysis tool with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score |\n|------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0.0                    |\n| Obfuscated       | 0.0                    |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1 (very low)         |\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's static, read-only nature.",
