{
  "purpose": "This code is a static Python parser and analyzer that converts source code into an internal AST representation, extracts docstrings, import statements, class/function definitions, and code structure for documentation or analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads source code strings, AST nodes, comments, and code structure elements such as function and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "String conversions, location tracking, and data extraction within internal data structures; no external or system sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Source code input → parsing into AST → internal data extraction and processing → no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or sabotage detected. Use of 'ast.literal_eval' on string literals is safe in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis using standard libraries ('lib2to3', 'blib2to3') without executing untrusted code. It extracts docstrings, import statements, class/function definitions, and variable declarations. No signs of malicious patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution are present. The only operation that could be mildly risky is 'ast.literal_eval', which is safely used on string literals only. The code is well-structured, with no hidden or malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate static analysis tool for Python source code, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or sabotage. The security risk is very low, and the malware score is 0. The use of 'ast.literal_eval' is safe in this context. The assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent.",
