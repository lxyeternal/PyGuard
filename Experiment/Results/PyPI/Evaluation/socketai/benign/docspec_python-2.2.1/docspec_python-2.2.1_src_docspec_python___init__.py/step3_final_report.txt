  "purpose": "Utility functions for discovering, loading, and parsing Python modules and packages, facilitating static analysis and tooling.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads (os.path, Path, recurse_directory), module resolution (find_module), file-like objects (io.open), sys.path",
  "sinks": "File reads, directory traversal, module parsing; no network or code execution",
  "flows": "Input module/package names or paths lead to filesystem lookups, file reads, and parsing functions",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns; standard filesystem and parsing operations",
  "analysis": "The code performs static discovery and parsing of Python modules/packages using standard libraries and custom filesystem traversal. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data that could lead to malicious behavior is present. The functions are well-structured, with appropriate error handling. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are detected. The code is benign and intended for static analysis or tooling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for static analysis and module discovery. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality.",
