  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a utility module for discovering, loading, and parsing Python modules/packages.\n- It uses standard libraries (os, sys, pathlib, io) and custom modules (e.g., nr.util.fs, docspec, parser).\n- No code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data that could lead to malicious effects is evident.\n- The functions perform filesystem operations, module resolution, and code parsing.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears well-structured, with appropriate error handling and comments.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for loading, parsing, discovering modules/packages.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior; standard filesystem and module discovery.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Verdict:** The low risk score (0.2) is reasonable. Malware score=0 is justified. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar utility functions for loading/parsing modules.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; standard static analysis tooling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n- **Purpose:** Discovery, loading, parsing modules/packages.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code; standard filesystem operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n- **Purpose:** Module/package discovery, loading, parsing.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior; standard utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly lower risk score (0.1) is justified, given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n- **Purpose:** Static analysis utility for modules/packages.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; filesystem operations only.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) is reasonable given the code's nature. The code doesn't perform dangerous operations but handles filesystem and module resolution, which could be misused if the input is malicious. The low scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (low, given the utility nature)\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a benign utility module for static analysis, with no security risks or malware evident.",
