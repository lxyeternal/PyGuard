  "purpose": "A command-line utility for discovering, parsing, and dumping Python modules and packages, relying on external libraries for core functionality.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, sys.path, and external modules (`docspec`, `docspec_python`) during module discovery and loading.",
  "sinks": "Output to stdout via `dump_module`; no untrusted data sinks or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "User input via command-line args → module discovery/loading → output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution; exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool that parses arguments, performs module discovery with `discover`, loads modules with `load_python_modules`, and dumps module info with `dump_module`. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data insecurely. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The external libraries used are assumed safe. Exception handling is appropriate. The code's clarity and lack of suspicious patterns support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, safe utility for Python module analysis with no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
