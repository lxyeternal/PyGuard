{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface for discovering, parsing, and dumping Python modules and packages, primarily for analysis or documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from command-line arguments, including module/package names, search paths, and discovery flags.",
  "sinks": "The script writes output to stdout, including module structures and listings. It does not process untrusted data directly but reads user input from command line.",
  "flows": "User input from command-line arguments flows into module discovery, parsing, and dumping functions. Data flow is straightforward and controlled, with no untrusted data propagation into system calls or external resources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors are present. The script does not handle sensitive credentials, perform network operations, or execute untrusted code. It simply loads and displays module information.",
  "analysis": "The script uses argparse for argument parsing, handles module discovery with potential exclusion, and loads Python modules for inspection. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code primarily relies on safe library functions and standard I/O operations. No hardcoded secrets, unsafe code execution, or malicious network activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI tool for Python module discovery and inspection. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and appropriate for use in supply chain contexts.",
