      "conclusion": "The code functions as a Swagger documentation generator with a configurable external file loading feature. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The primary security concern is unvalidated external file access, which is already reflected in the moderate risk scores. Overall, the code is benign, with the main risk being potential local file disclosure if inputs are untrusted."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is generally benign and performs a legitimate utility function. The primary security risk stems from unvalidated dynamic loading of code via the 'app' argument, which could be exploited if an attacker supplies a malicious package or entry point. No malware or obfuscation is present. The malware score remains at 0. The risk score should be increased to approximately 0.7-0.8 to reflect the potential for code execution via malicious input. Implementing validation or sanitization of the 'app' argument is recommended to mitigate this risk."
