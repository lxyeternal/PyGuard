  "conclusion": "The code functions as a Swagger documentation generator with a configurable external file loading feature. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The primary security concern is unvalidated external file access, which is already reflected in the moderate risk scores. Overall, the code is benign, with the main risk being potential local file disclosure if inputs are untrusted."
