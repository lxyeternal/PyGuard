  "purpose": "Generate Swagger 2.0 schema documentation by inspecting Flask endpoints and extracting docstrings, optionally loading external files specified within docstrings.",
  "sources": "Docstrings of Flask view functions, external files indicated by 'from_file_keyword' within docstrings",
  "sinks": "External file reading via open() when 'from_file_keyword' is present; no other sinks detected",
  "flows": "Docstring content (source) potentially leading to external file load (sink) if 'from_file_keyword' is used",
  "anomalies": "External file loading based on docstring directives without validation; no malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code inspects Flask routes, extracts docstrings, and optionally loads external files based on content in docstrings. No code injection, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The main security concern is unvalidated external file access if 'from_file_keyword' is manipulated. No obfuscation or malware is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are consistent with the behavior. The potential for local file disclosure exists if untrusted input influences file paths, but no active malicious intent is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a Swagger documentation generator with a configurable external file loading feature. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The primary security concern is unvalidated external file access, which is already reflected in the moderate risk scores. Overall, the code is benign, with the main risk being potential local file disclosure if inputs are untrusted.",
