  "purpose": "Generate a Swagger/OpenAPI specification for a specified Flask app, with options to customize the output and template.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments, reading files specified by arguments (template, definitions), loading a Flask app entry point.",
  "sinks": "Writing the final swagger JSON to stdout or a specified file.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> file reading (template and definitions) -> modification of template -> swagger generation -> output to stdout or file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. Usage of dynamic code loading via pkg_resources.EntryPoint.parse is typical for plugin systems but can be misused if the input is maliciously crafted. The code reads files specified by user input, which could be malicious if those files are controlled by an attacker, but this is standard behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments to determine input files and output options. It loads a Flask app via pkg_resources, which is standard for plugin-like architectures. It reads a JSON template and optionally overlays definitions from user-provided files, then generates a Swagger spec via flask_swagger's swagger() function. The output is printed or written to a file. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code only performs file reading and JSON processing based on user inputs, with no network activity or harmful behavior. The only potential concern is reliance on external files and dynamic app loading, which is common in such tools but could be exploited if malicious files are supplied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for generating Swagger specifications from a Flask app. It does not contain any malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The use of dynamic app loading and file reading is typical for such tools and poses no immediate security risk, assuming trusted input files and environment.",
