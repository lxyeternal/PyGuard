  "purpose": "The code parses signature strings, mapping types and defaults, primarily via eval() to generate default values and types. It facilitates signature processing for Qt/PySide bindings.",
  "sources": "Signature strings passed to 'pyside_type_init', particularly in functions like 'calculate_props' and 'fixup_multilines'.",
  "sinks": "eval() calls in 'make_good_value', 'try_to_guess', '_resolve_value', and '_resolve_type' functions, which execute dynamically constructed code strings.",
  "flows": "Signature strings -> eval() in 'make_good_value' and related functions -> dynamic type and default value generation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on signature strings without sanitization; no input validation or sanitization observed before eval().",
  "analysis": "The code processes signature definitions, converting string representations into Python objects or types. It relies heavily on eval() to interpret these strings, which poses a security risk if the input strings are untrusted or maliciously crafted. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are evident, but the eval() usage could lead to code execution vulnerabilities. The overall structure is straightforward, but the unsafe eval() calls are the primary concern. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is detected, but the security risk is significant if inputs are untrusted. The risk score should be elevated to reflect this vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate signature parser with a critical security flaw due to unsafe eval() usage. If signature strings are controlled and sanitized, the risk is minimal. Otherwise, it could be exploited for arbitrary code execution. The malware score remains 0, obfuscation is absent, but the security risk is high; a score of approximately 0.65 is appropriate.",
