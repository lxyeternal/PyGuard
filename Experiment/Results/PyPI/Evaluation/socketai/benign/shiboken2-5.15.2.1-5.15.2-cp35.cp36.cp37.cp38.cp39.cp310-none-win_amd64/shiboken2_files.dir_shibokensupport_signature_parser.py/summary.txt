  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate signature parser with a critical security flaw due to unsafe eval() usage. If signature strings are controlled and sanitized, the risk is minimal. Otherwise, it could be exploited for arbitrary code execution. The malware score remains 0, obfuscation is absent, but the security risk is high; a score of approximately 0.65 is appropriate."
