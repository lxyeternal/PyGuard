{
  "purpose": "The code sets version information and pre-imports various Python modules, including internal and external dependencies, to prepare the environment for subsequent operations, likely related to module embedding or signature initialization.",
  "sources": "Reads data from sys.version_info, importing standard modules like sys, os, zipfile, base64, marshal, io, etc., and from the local module .shiboken2.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data processing, network operations, or sensitive data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "The code primarily initializes imports and sets version info without processing untrusted input or data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. All imported modules are standard or known dependencies; the import of .shiboken2 could be standard for PySide projects. The comment about PyInstaller and module loading is typical for packaging scenarios.",
  "analysis": "The script defines version info variables, comments on issues with module importation in certain environments, and explicitly imports necessary modules to ensure their availability. The import of shiboken2 suggests integration with PySide or Qt-related components. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The presence of __builtins__ trigger indicates initialization logic common in packaging or extension setups. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard setup script for preparing environment dependencies in a PySide/PyInstaller context. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
