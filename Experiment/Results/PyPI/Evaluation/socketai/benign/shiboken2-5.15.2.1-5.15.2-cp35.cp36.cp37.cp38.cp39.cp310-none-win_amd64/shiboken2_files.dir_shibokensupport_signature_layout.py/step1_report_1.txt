{
  "purpose": "This module configures and manages different signature layouts for Python function signatures, allowing customized representation based on specified options.",
  "sources": "Import statements (shibokensupport.signature, shibokensupport.signature.mapping, shibokensupport.signature.lib.tool), class definitions, function definitions, and internal variable initializations.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly. The code mainly defines classes and functions for signature manipulation without external data sinks or system interactions.",
  "flows": "The code processes signature parameters and layouts internally without external data flows or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are evident. The code is primarily a configuration and utility module for signature formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for managing signature layouts, including validation of configuration options and signature manipulation. There is no evidence of data leaks, network communication, or suspicious system modifications. The module performs static configuration tasks and uses safe, standard Python features. No obfuscated code or malicious activity is detected. The structure appears well-formed and consistent with legitimate signature handling utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for signature configuration and manipulation. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It is safe and intended for internal use in signature processing, with no security risks identified.",
