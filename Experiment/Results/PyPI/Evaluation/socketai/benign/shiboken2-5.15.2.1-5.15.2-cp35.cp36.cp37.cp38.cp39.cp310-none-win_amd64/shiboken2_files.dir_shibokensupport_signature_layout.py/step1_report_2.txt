{
  "purpose": "This module defines various signature layout configurations and utility functions for signature manipulation in the context of Python code inspection and type hinting, primarily for use with the 'shibokensupport' library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, annotations, default values, and configuration arguments; it also imports modules like 'inspect', 'typing', and 'shibokensupport.signature'.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data could flow into parameter annotations, default values, or signature modifications, but the code mainly operates on internal data and configurations. No external sinks directly process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code constructs signature objects based on input parameter data and configurations, manipulating signature parameters and annotations internally without external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code performs standard signature configuration and manipulation tasks; no obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a SignatureLayout class for configuring signature string layouts with validation, and utility functions for creating nameless parameters and signatures. It imports external modules for inspection and typing support. No external data is fetched or transmitted; the operations are purely internal. The code handles signature customization and parameter manipulation, which are standard tasks. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent, and the functions operate within expected parameters without executing external or untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate utility module for managing function signatures and signatures layouts. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is well-structured, with input validation and no suspicious operations.",
