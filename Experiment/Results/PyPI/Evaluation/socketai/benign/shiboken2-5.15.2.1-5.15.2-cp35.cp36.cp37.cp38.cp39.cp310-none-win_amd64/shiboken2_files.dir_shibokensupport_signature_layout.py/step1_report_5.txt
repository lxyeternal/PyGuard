{
  "purpose": "The module defines classes and functions to configure and generate function signatures with customizable layouts for use in Python signature inspection and documentation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters in functions, class attributes, imported modules, and possibly external configuration via function parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the code appears to directly process untrusted external data in a way that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs (parameters and function arguments) through signature creation functions and class attribute settings, with no external untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses dynamic class creation and attribute management but in a standard, intended manner. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a SignatureLayout class for managing signature configuration options, with validation to prevent invalid attributes or values. It includes functions for creating nameless parameters by overriding __str__, and functions for generating signatures based on layout configurations. The code imports from support modules, but no external data inputs, network activity, or file I/O that could be malicious are present. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are found. The dynamic class creation and attribute management are within normal bounds for advanced Python metaprogramming, and no malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard implementation of signature configuration and generation utilities with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured utility module.",
