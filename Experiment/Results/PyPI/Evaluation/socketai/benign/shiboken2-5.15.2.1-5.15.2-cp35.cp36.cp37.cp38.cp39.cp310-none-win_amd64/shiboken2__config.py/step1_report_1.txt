  "purpose": "Define version and build information for the shiboken library.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements assigning version-related data to variables.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. Version information is static and typical for library metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static version strings and numerical data to variables, representing library version and build date. There are no dynamic code executions, no external data reads, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation. The data appears to be typical library metadata. No malicious intent is evident based on this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is simply defining version and build information for the library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
