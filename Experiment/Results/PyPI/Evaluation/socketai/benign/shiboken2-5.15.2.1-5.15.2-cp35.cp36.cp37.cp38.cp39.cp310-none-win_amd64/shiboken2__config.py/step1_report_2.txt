  "purpose": "Define version-related metadata for a Python package or library.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting string and numeric version identifiers, and a build date.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted input to critical variables; all are static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments to version strings, numeric tuples, and a build date. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, nor any external data handling. All variables appear to be metadata descriptors, typical for package versioning. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, static assignment of version metadata with no malicious intent or security issues. It serves to provide package version information and build date, which is standard practice.",
