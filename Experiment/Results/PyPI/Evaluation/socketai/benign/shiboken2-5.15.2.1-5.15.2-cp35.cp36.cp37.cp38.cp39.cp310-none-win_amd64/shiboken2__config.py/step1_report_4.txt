  "purpose": "Define versioning and build date information for a Python library or package.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version, shiboken library version, and build date.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static version strings and build date metadata to variables. All data are hardcoded string or numeric literals. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no input/output operations. The variables seem intended for version management or documentation purposes. There is no indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The structure is straightforward and typical for package version info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple set of metadata assignments for a Python package, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
