  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports consistently identify that the code is purely static variable assignments for versioning and build metadata.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be standard, benign package metadata.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or behavior:**\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n2. **Obfuscation:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as non-obfuscated (obfuscated=0).\n\n3. **Risk scoring:**\n   - The risk score is 0 in all reports, which seems appropriate given the static, metadata-only nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential vulnerabilities:**\n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis correctly states that there are no dynamic or insecure behaviors.\n\n**Score justification:**\n\n- Since all reports are consistent and the code is indeed just static metadata, the scores seem reasonable.\n- The confidence level is 1, indicating certainty.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores or reasoning.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\n- The code is typical for package versioning and build info.\n- No further security concerns are warranted based on this fragment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The scoring aligns well with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's nature.",
