  "purpose": "Metadata assignment for versioning and build information in a Python package.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments defining version strings, version info, and build date.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static metadata variables do not process external input.",
  "flows": "N/A – static assignments without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for versioning and build metadata, with no dynamic behavior, input/output, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores set to 0. The code serves a standard purpose and presents no security concerns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely metadata for versioning, with no malicious or security issues. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
