  "purpose": "Define version information and library version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements defining version variables and build date.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or external data flow.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; all are static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward variable assignments for versioning and build metadata. It sets the library version string, version tuple, build date, and package version as static strings or tuples. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no potential data leaks are present. The code appears to be purely informational with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata for a package or module versioning. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks detected.",
