  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted input sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "All variables are assigned static, hardcoded strings or tuples; no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments for versioning and build metadata. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no output or network communication. No obfuscated code, no dynamic evaluation, and no hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. It appears to be standard metadata declaration code with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and only contains static metadata variables related to the package version and build date. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security threats.",
