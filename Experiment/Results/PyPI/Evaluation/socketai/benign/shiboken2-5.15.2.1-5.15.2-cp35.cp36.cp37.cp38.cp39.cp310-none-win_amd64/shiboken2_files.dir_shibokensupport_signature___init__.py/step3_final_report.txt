{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a licensing and metadata header for the Qt for Python project, including licensing notices, import compatibility statements, and an __all__ declaration for public API symbols.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from licensing comments, the import statement, and the __all__ list declaration.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or data leaks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is standard boilerplate with licensing info and minimal import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments, a future import statement for compatibility, and an __all__ list defining public symbols. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execute logic that could be malicious. The import statement is standard and safe. The __all__ list is straightforward. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the benign and static nature of the code. The confidence level is high (1.0) due to the clarity and simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a license header with minimal functional code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the code content, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
