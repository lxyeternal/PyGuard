  "purpose": "This code appears to be a license and copyright notice header for a Python module related to Qt for Python, specifying licensing terms and distribution rights.",
  "sources": "The license and copyright comments at the beginning of the file.",
  "sinks": "There are no data inputs, outputs, or untrusted data handling in the visible code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow involving untrusted data is present; the code only contains comments and an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is solely licensing information with no executable logic, data handling, or suspicious code patterns. The __all__ variable is set to a list of strings, which is normal for defining public API.",
  "analysis": "The file contains only licensing comments and an import statement for print_function and absolute_import, along with an __all__ declaration listing four strings. No functions, variables, or data handling occurs. The __all__ list defines exported symbols, which is standard practice. No obfuscated code, suspicious activity, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This file is purely a licensing header with minimal Python code for defining the public API. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
