{
  "purpose": "This module provides a mapping from C++ Qt/PySide signatures to Python types, supporting dynamic module loading and type registration for Qt bindings.",
  "sources": "Code reads input primarily during module initialization, type registration, and dynamic updates via sys.modules; no external untrusted input is processed.",
  "sinks": "Type mappings and module updates; no data leaks or system effects; eval() is used internally for code generation within a controlled wrapper.",
  "flows": "eval() in _NotCalled.__call__ generates code snippets from internally constructed strings; no external data flows into eval().",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() wrapped within a class designed to prevent execution of arbitrary code; no external input influences eval().",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a support layer for Qt/PySide bindings, with dynamic module management and extensive type mappings. The eval() in _NotCalled.__call__ is used solely for code generation or placeholder purposes, not executing untrusted code. No malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The type maps and module updates are standard for such support modules. The eval() usage, while potentially risky, is controlled and encapsulated, minimizing security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured support module for Qt/PySide bindings. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage activity is detected. The eval() usage is contained within wrappers and used for code generation, not malicious execution. The security risk is minimal, and malware scores should remain at 0.",
