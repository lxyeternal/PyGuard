{
  "purpose": "This module defines type mappings, constants, and initialization functions for PySide and related Qt modules, primarily for use in signature generation, type hinting, or code analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, struct, os, shibokensupport.signature, and PySide2 modules; assignment and update of type_map; function definitions for initializing module-specific types and constants.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted input or data; no network, file, or environment variable interactions present.",
  "flows": "The code sets up a series of mappings and functions that register types and constants; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, nor any execution paths that process external input maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval in _NotCalled.__call__, which could execute arbitrary code if a _NotCalled instance is called with malicious content. However, this is encapsulated within a wrapper class designed to avoid actual invocation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are evident. The code contains extensive license and comment headers but no obfuscated or malicious code logic.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a static configuration for type mapping and module initialization with helper classes and functions. The only potentially risky construct is the eval call within the _NotCalled.__call__ method, which is a controlled wrapper used to generate code snippets or placeholders, not to execute untrusted code directly. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification operations are present. The code appears consistent with its purpose of setting up type mappings for Qt/PySide modules and is free from malware indicators or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration module for type mapping and initialization within the PySide/PyQt ecosystem. It contains a controlled eval within a wrapper class but no malicious intent or harmful behavior. No security threats or malware signatures are detected.",
