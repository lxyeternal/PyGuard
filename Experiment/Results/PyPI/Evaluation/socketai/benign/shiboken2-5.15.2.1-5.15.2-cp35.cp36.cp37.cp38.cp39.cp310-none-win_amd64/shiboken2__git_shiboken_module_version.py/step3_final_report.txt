  "purpose": "Defines static version information variables and outputs them for build systems or version tracking.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments for version components; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputs version info; no untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Static variables assigned, then printed directly when executed as main.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard license comments and straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static script that assigns version components as strings and prints them when run directly. It contains no external data input, network activity, or obfuscation. License comments are standard legal notices. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code serves a legitimate purpose in version reporting for build systems. No vulnerabilities or security risks are evident, and the code structure is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard version info utility. No malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
