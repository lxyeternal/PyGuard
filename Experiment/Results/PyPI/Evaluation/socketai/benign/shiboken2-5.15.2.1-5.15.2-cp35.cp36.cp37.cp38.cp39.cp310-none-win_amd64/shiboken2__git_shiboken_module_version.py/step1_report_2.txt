{
  "purpose": "The code defines version information for the Qt for Python package and outputs it for use by build systems like CMake.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded version components and release type variables.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a formatted string containing version information, which could be used in build or deployment scripts.",
  "flows": "Variables are assigned values, and then these variables are formatted into a string for printing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward version management logic.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version-related variables, including major, minor, patch, release type, and pre-release identifiers. It then prints these values formatted as a string for external use, typically in build processes. No untrusted input sources or data sinks are involved. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code intent. The structure is simple, and all code serves a legitimate purpose related to version information reporting.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version information script for a software package, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It simply outputs predefined version data for build automation.",
