  "purpose": "Define version information for Qt for Python and output version details when run as a script.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments and the __name__ == '__main__' block that prints formatted version info.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs version info to standard output; no untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "No external data flows from input sources; static variables are used, and the only flow is printing version info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static string variables defining version components and license information, with a straightforward print statement executed only when the script is run directly. There are no input sources, data manipulation, or network activity. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version definition script for a library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply outputs version information when executed. No malicious behavior or security concerns are identified.",
