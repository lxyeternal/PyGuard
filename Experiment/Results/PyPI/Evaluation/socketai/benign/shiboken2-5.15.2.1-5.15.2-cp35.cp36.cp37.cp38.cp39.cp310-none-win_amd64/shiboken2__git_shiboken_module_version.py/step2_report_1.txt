  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Findings from Reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward version information script.\n- The code only defines static version variables and prints them when run as a script.\n- No external input, network activity, file I/O, or data manipulation occurs.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The license comments are standard and do not contain malicious content.\n- The purpose is clearly to provide version info for build systems like CMake.\n\n**Confirmation of the code's behavior:**\n\n- The code is benign, serving a legitimate purpose in software versioning.\n- There are no anomalies, suspicious constructs, or security risks identified.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Critical Evaluation:**\n\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- The lack of external data handling or network activity means no attack surface.\n- The license comments are standard legal notices, not malicious payloads.\n- The static nature of the variables and the simple print statement indicate no obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment of the scores:**\n\n- Malware score: 0 is appropriate; no malicious behavior detected.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is appropriate; code is straightforward.\n- Risk score: 0 is appropriate; no security risk present.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the provided assessments. The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus in the reports.",
