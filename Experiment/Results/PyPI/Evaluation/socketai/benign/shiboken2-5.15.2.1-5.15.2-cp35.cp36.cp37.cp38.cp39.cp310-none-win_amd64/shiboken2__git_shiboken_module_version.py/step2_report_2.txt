  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The code defines version info, outputs it, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no external input, no obfuscation, no suspicious constructs. The license comments are standard.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (appropriate, no security risk)  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard version info script.  \n- **Assessment:** No anomalies, no malicious code, no external data flow.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Again, a simple static version info script.  \n- **Assessment:** No suspicious behavior, no external inputs, straightforward print of static data.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Same pattern, static version info output.  \n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, no external data.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Same as others, static version info printing.  \n- **Assessment:** No anomalies, no malicious code, straightforward implementation.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected in any report.  \n- **Obfuscation or suspicious constructs:** None observed.  \n- **Vulnerabilities or security risks:** None, as the code is purely static and intended for version reporting.  \n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assigned 0, as there's no malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly assigned 0.  \n- **Risk score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated overall security risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign version information script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, straightforward, and serves a legitimate purpose.  \n- No changes needed to the scores or assessments.  \n- No further action required.",
