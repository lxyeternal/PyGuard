{
  "purpose": "The code defines version information for a Qt for Python package, formatting and printing version details based on variables.",
  "sources": "Variables: major_version, minor_version, patch_version, release_version_type, pre_release_version.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs formatted version information; no untrusted input or external data is used.",
  "flows": "The source variables are concatenated and output via print, with no external data flow or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all variables are hardcoded string values, and the code simply formats and outputs version info.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes several version-related variables, then prints them in a formatted string when executed as the main program. No external inputs, network activity, or file operations occur. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version info script with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely outputs predefined version strings, serving as a utility within a larger build or deployment process.",
