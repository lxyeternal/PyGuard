  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code presence and behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple versioning script, assigning static string variables for version components and printing them when run directly.\n   - No external inputs, network calls, file I/O, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.\n\n2. **Malicious or suspicious elements**:\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are detected.\n   - The license comments are standard and do not contain any suspicious or malicious content.\n   - The print statement outputs version info only, which is typical for build scripts.\n\n3. **Scores and reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1.0), consistent with the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Potential issues or assumptions**:\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities or exploits are made; all reports are consistent.\n   - The purpose is solely to define and output version information, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Overall assessment**:\n   - The code is a standard, benign version configuration script.\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable and justified.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**Final conclusion**:\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- The report is accurate in its assessment.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
