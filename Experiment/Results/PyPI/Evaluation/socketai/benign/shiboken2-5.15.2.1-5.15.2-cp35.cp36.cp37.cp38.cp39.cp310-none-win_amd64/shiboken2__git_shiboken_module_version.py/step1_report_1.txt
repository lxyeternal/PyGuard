{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for Qt for Python and prints it when run as a script, likely for use in build or configuration processes.",
  "sources": "Constants and variables assigned at the beginning of the file; environment variables are not read.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs version information; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction occurs.",
  "flows": "Variable definitions -> conditional main check -> print statement output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; the code is straightforward and only outputs version info.",
  "analysis": "The script sets version-related variables and outputs them if executed directly. It appears to be a standard version configuration script used for build automation. There are no external data inputs, no network interactions, no file manipulations, and no suspicious behavior. The structure and content are typical for open-source project versioning scripts. The license comments at the top are standard and do not contain malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version information provider for the build process. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
