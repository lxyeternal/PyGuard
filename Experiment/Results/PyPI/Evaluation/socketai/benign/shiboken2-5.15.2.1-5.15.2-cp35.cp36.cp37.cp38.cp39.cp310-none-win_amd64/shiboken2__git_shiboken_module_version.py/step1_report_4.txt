  "purpose": "Define and output version information for Qt for Python.",
  "sources": "Variables assigned at the beginning and within the main block; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs version info; no untrusted data handling or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code simply formats and prints static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares version-related variables, which are static string assignments. The only dynamic operation occurs inside the main block, where it prints these variables formatted into a string. This is a standard pattern for version information scripts. No external input, no network activity, no file I/O, and no suspicious code features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version info generator with no malicious or suspicious elements. It simply outputs static version details when executed, serving a benign purpose.",
