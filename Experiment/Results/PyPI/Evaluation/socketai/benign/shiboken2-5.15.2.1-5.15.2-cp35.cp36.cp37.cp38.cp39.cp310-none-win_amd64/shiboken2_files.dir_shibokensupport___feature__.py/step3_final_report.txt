  "purpose": "Manage feature flags for Qt for Python using dynamic import hooks and frame inspection, primarily for internal feature toggling.",
  "sources": "sys._getframe(), sys.modules, function parameters, internal dictionaries",
  "sinks": "Internal feature dictionaries, module functions, no external data leaks or network activity",
  "flows": "Reads from call stack and modules, updates internal feature flags, calls internal methods to initialize features",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys._getframe() and dynamic import hooks; variable names and code complexity suggest advanced techniques but no malicious obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a feature flag management system employing dynamic import hooks and frame inspection for internal control. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The use of sys._getframe() and import hooks could be misused in malicious contexts, but here they serve legitimate purposes. The obfuscation level is minimal, mostly due to variable naming and dynamic code, which is typical for such internal mechanisms. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is detected. The obfuscated score is 0.2, justified by the code's complexity but not malicious obfuscation. The security risk score is 0.2, reflecting potential for misuse but no active threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate internal feature management system with complex but benign techniques. It does not contain malware or malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a malware score of 0, an obfuscated score of 0.2, and a risk score of 0.2.",
