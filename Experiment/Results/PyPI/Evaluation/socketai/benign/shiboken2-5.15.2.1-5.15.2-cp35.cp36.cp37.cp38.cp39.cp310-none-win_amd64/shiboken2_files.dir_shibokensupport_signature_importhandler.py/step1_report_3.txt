  "purpose": "This code manages special actions after importing PySide2 modules, specifically to replace deprecated functions with Python implementations that issue warnings.",
  "sources": "Imports from PySide2.support.deprecated, module.__name__ attribute, and the exception object in the try-except block.",
  "sinks": "Function calls to deprecated functions, printing error messages to stdout.",
  "flows": "Import of PySide2.support.deprecated -> conditional function call based on module name -> potential error handling output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code performs routine import handling and warning substitution. Exception handling prints errors but does not log or leak sensitive data. No external network connections or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import a specific support module from PySide2. If successful, it sets a flag. It defines a function to fix deprecated modules by calling functions in the deprecated module based on the module name. Error handling prints messages to stdout. The code includes comments explaining design choices and avoids dynamic import tricks that could lead to obfuscation. There are no signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for handling deprecated PySide2 modules, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
