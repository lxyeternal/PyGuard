  "purpose": "Handle post-import actions for PySide2 modules, redirecting deprecated functions to custom implementations with warnings.",
  "sources": "Module import of 'deprecated' from PySide2.support, and module.__name__ during finish_import call.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic getattr calls to functions in deprecated module, error print statements.",
  "flows": "Import 'deprecated' -> finish_import called with module -> constructs function name -> getattr(deprecated, name) -> calls function if exists -> exception handling prints errors.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute access controlled by module name; exception handling with print statements; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports a support module and defines a function to invoke specific deprecated handlers based on module name. It employs controlled dynamic attribute access and exception handling to avoid crashes. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The purpose is to maintain backward compatibility and warn users about deprecated functions. The dynamic calls are based on known module names, reducing risk. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing deprecated PySide2 functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
