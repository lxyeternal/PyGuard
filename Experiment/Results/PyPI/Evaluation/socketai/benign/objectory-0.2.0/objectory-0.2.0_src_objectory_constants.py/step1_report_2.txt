{
  "purpose": "Define constants used for referencing object initialization and target attributes in a package, facilitating robustness to naming changes.",
  "sources": "Import statements, module-level constant definitions, docstring",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, no data leaks, no unsafe operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only sets constants",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward constant definitions and descriptive docstring",
  "analysis": "The code provides a clear docstring explaining the purpose of constants and an example usage. It imports __future__.annotations, defines two constants, and exports them via __all__. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple, benign constants module for internal use, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
