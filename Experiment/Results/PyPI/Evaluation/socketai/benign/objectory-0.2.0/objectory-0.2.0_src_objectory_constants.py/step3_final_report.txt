  "purpose": "Define constants used in object configuration to ensure robustness against naming changes.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string constants `_init_` and `_target_`",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "Not applicable; constants are used as keys, no data flow present",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward constant definitions with example usage",
  "analysis": "The code defines two string constants `_init_` and `_target_` with a descriptive docstring and example. It imports `__future__.annotations` for forward reference support. There are no dynamic behaviors, user inputs, network activities, or obfuscation. The constants serve as keys for object configuration, and the code is static and benign. All reports correctly identify the code as simple, non-malicious, and free of vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature and should remain unchanged.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign constants module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the current scoring is appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
