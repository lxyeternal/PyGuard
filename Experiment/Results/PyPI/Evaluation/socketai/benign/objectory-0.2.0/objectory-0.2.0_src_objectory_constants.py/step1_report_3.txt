  "purpose": "Define constants used in the package to promote robustness and ease of configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statement for annotations, definition of string constants OBJECT_INIT and OBJECT_TARGET.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data input, no external data sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; constants are simply defined and exported.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides documentation and defines two string constants intended for external use. It includes an example demonstrating how the constants can be used to instantiate objects dynamically. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, input handling, or external communications. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module defining constants for use elsewhere. No malicious intent or security risks detected.",
