  "purpose": "Define constants used in the package for robustness to naming changes and external usage.",
  "sources": "Import statement for future annotations, module-level constants OBJECT_INIT and OBJECT_TARGET.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data sources present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; constants are static string values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining string constants and including an example usage. It imports __future__.annotations, which is standard for forward references. The constants are simple strings used as keys. No user input handling, network operations, or data manipulation occurs. The example demonstrates how the constants can be used in a typical application, with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign constants module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
