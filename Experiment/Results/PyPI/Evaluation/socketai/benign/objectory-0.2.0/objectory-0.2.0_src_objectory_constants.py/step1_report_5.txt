  "purpose": "Define constants used in a Python package for robustness and external usage.",
  "sources": "The module imports __future__.annotations and defines two constants OBJECT_INIT and OBJECT_TARGET.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or external input sources detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; straightforward constant definitions with no dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module defining two string constants, with a docstring explaining their use. It includes a future import for annotations and uses __all__ for exports. No malicious code, obfuscated patterns, or security risks are present. The code appears to be standard, safe, and intended for external reference.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module defining constants with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is straightforward and safe for use.",
