  "purpose": "Define constants used in the package for external robustness and provide example usage documentation.",
  "sources": "Module-level string assignments for OBJECT_INIT and OBJECT_TARGET; docstring for documentation and example.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data handling or output; no data leaks or insecure operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only static definitions and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The example usage is standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of simple constant definitions and a descriptive docstring. It imports annotations from __future__, which is standard for compatibility. The __all__ list explicitly exposes constants. The example usage demonstrates typical dynamic object creation with no suspicious activity. No external data sources or sinks are present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module defining constants and documenting their usage. It contains no malicious or security-sensitive behavior.",
