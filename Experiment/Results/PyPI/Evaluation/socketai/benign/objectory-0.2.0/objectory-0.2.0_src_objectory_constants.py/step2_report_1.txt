  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the reports and the code:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code defines two string constants: `_init_` and `_target_`.\n   - It includes a docstring with an example demonstrating how these constants are used in a typical object factory pattern.\n   - The import of `__future__.annotations` is standard for forward references.\n   - No dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or data manipulation is present.\n   - The constants are simple string keys, intended for internal or external use to promote robustness against naming changes.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.\n   - The example usage is typical and benign.\n   - There are no external data sources or sinks.\n   - No suspicious patterns or behaviors are evident.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly describe the code as simple, benign, and straightforward.\n   - They correctly identify that the code defines constants for internal/external use, with no malicious intent.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the clear, non-malicious nature of the code.\n   - The obfuscated, malware, and security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the code's content.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n   - No issues are present in the reports.\n   - The reasoning in each report is sound and consistent.\n   - The example usage and documentation are standard and do not suggest any malicious intent.\n\n5. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, as there is no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, as the code is benign.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The code is a benign constants module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- Keep the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- No further action needed; the code is safe and well-understood.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
