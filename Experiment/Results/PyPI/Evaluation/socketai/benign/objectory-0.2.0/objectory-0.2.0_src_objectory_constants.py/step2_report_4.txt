  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a straightforward module defining two string constants (`_init_` and `_target_`) with descriptive docstrings and an example usage.\n   - It imports `__future__.annotations`, which is standard for forward references.\n   - No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or data manipulation occurs.\n   - The constants are used as keys, likely for referencing object attributes or configuration parameters.\n\n2. **Potential Security Concerns:**\n   - The code is static, with no untrusted data handling, no code execution, no external data sources, and no obfuscation.\n   - The example usage is benign, demonstrating typical object creation with no suspicious behavior.\n   - No signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n\n3. **Malware & Obfuscation Scores:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n   - No indication of malicious intent or obfuscation techniques.\n\n4. **Risk Scores:**\n   - All reports assign a security risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The purpose of the code is to define constants for robustness and external use, which is standard practice.\n\n5. **Logical & Reasoning Flaws:**\n   - No flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports. They consistently recognize the code as benign and straightforward.\n   - The reasoning is sound, emphasizing the static, non-malicious nature of the code.\n\n6. **Scores Consistency & Justification:**\n   - The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features, the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a benign, straightforward constants module with no security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| Malware          | 0            |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            |\n| Security Risk    | 0            |\n\nThis analysis confirms the code's safety and benign nature.",
