  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the reports and the code:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines two string constants: `OBJECT_INIT` and `OBJECT_TARGET`.\n   - It imports `__future__.annotations`, which is standard for forward references.\n   - It includes a comprehensive docstring with an example demonstrating how these constants might be used in a typical scenario.\n   - There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, network calls, or data manipulations.\n   - The constants are static strings, used as keys for referencing object attributes or initialization parameters.\n\n2. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, benign, and intended for defining constants.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - The confidence scores are all at 1, indicating certainty about benign nature.\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n   - The security risk scores are 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n3. **Potential Issues or Flaws**:\n   - No issues are detected in the code.\n   - The reports do not identify any anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The example usage is standard and does not raise concerns.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - The malware scores are appropriately zero.\n   - The obfuscated scores are zero, as expected.\n   - The security risk scores are zero, consistent with the analysis.\n   - The confidence levels are all at maximum, which is justified given the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n5. **Overall Justification**:\n   - The code is a minimal constants module with no security concerns.\n   - The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores reflect the actual content and risk.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a benign, straightforward constants module with no malicious or security issues. The reports correctly identify this, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. No further action or adjustment is needed.",
