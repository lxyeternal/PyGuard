  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a typical `__init__.py` file for the `objectory` package.\n- It imports specific classes and constants from internal submodules (`abstract_factory`, `constants`, `registry`, `universal`).\n- It defines `__all__` to specify what symbols are exported when the package is imported.\n- The code contains no dynamic execution, user input handling, network activity, or other behaviors that could be malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Observations:\n- The code is straightforward, standard for a package's initialization.\n- No signs of obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent.\n- No external data sources or sinks.\n- No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.\n- No evidence of data flow from untrusted sources.\n\n### Analysis of the Reports:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, benign package initializer.\n- The confidence levels are all 1.0, indicating high certainty.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the straightforward nature.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, indicating no identified vulnerabilities or risks.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying that this code is benign.\n- No report suggests any suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The reasoning in all reports is sound; the code is purely structural.\n\n### Final Score Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard package initializer with no security concerns. The high confidence and consistent analysis across reports support these scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, standard `__init__.py` file for the `objectory` package.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements are present.\n- The current scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
