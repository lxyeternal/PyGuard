{
  "purpose": "The code appears to serve as an __init__.py file for the 'objectory' package, mainly exporting classes and constants for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'objectory' submodules: 'abstract_factory', 'constants', 'registry', and 'universal'. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform potentially harmful operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs import statements and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code is standard for a package's initialization module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and constants from internal submodules and defines the __all__ list for module exports. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or network operations. The code structure is typical for a Python package __init__.py file, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets or potential backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward package initialization file that exports key components of the 'objectory' package. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity.",
