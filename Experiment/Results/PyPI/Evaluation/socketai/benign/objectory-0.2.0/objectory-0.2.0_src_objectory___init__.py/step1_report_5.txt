{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an initial module to define and expose core components of the 'objectory' package, including main classes, constants, and functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from external module 'objectory' components: abstract_factory, constants, registry, universal.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is processed or output, no untrusted data handling or external connections.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; there are no runtime data flows, no input-to-output data handling evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, primarily performing import statements and defining '__all__' for module exports. It only exposes components for other parts of the package or external modules, without any data processing, network activity, or external interactions. No signs of malicious or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple module initializer, exposing key components for the 'objectory' package. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation within this snippet.",
