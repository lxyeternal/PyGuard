{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports and exposes core features and components of the 'objectory' package, including classes, constants, and functions for object creation and registration.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'objectory' package modules: abstract_factory, constants, registry, and universal.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks that handle untrusted input; the code mainly imports and re-exports components.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only performs imports and exports without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for a package's __init__.py or main module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes, constants, and functions from the 'objectory' package modules and defines __all__ for public API exposure. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling that could indicate malicious intent. The code is purely structural, establishing namespace exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package module for exposing components. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks. It simply imports and re-exports package elements.",
