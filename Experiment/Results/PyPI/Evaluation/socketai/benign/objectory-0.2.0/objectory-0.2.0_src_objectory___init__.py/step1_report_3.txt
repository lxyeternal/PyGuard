{
  "purpose": "To define the main features and exports of the 'objectory' package by importing specific classes and constants.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'objectory' modules: abstract_factory, constants, registry, and universal.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are evident; the code only performs imports and defines exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static and purely imports-related.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The file is straightforward and typical for module entry points.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from the 'objectory' package and defines the __all__ list for exports. It contains no dynamic code execution, no handling of user input, and no network activity. The imports are from internal modules, with no apparent obfuscation or malicious pattern. The file functions as an initialization or metadata module, which is common in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this code. It appears to be a standard module declaration file intended to specify the public API of the package.",
