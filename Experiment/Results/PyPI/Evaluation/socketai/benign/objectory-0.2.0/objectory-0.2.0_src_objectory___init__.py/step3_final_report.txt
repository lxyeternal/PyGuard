  "purpose": "This code serves as the main initialization module for the 'objectory' package, importing key classes and constants and defining the public API.",
  "sources": "Internal module imports: objectory.abstract_factory, objectory.constants, objectory.registry, objectory.universal",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions",
  "flows": "Import statements to module namespace; no data flow from external sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export structure, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package __init__.py file, importing specific classes and constants from internal modules and defining __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or malicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safe, standard structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. All evidence and reports support a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
