  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a typical `__init__.py` or main module file for the `objectory` package.\n- It imports specific classes and constants from internal submodules:\n  - `AbstractFactory` from `objectory.abstract_factory`\n  - `OBJECT_INIT`, `OBJECT_TARGET` from `objectory.constants`\n  - `Registry` from `objectory.registry`\n  - `factory` from `objectory.universal`\n- It defines `__all__` to specify the public API exports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, no user input, no network operations, and no external data handling. All imports are from internal modules, and no suspicious or obfuscated patterns are evident.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected. The code appears to be a standard package initialization file.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as there is no data processing or external interaction.\n- **Obfuscation:** None. The code is clear and standard.\n- **Malware:** Zero, as there's no indication of malicious activity.\n- **Security risks:** None.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and scoring review:\n- The reports uniformly rate the code as benign, with confidence 1.0, and assign all scores for obfuscation, malware, and security risk as 0.0.\n- This is consistent with the code's structure and purpose.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Code issues:** None.\n- **Malware score:** Correct at 0.0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correct at 0.0.\n- **Risk score:** Correct at 0.0.\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The code is a typical, well-structured package initializer.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here, as the code only performs imports and exports.\n- No signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe and benign. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
