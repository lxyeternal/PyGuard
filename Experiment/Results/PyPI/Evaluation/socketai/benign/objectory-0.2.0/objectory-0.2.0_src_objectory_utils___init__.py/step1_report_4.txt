{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define utility functions or helpers related to object management and configuration, primarily for use in larger Python projects.",
  "sources": "Imports from objectory.utils modules: config, name_resolution, object_helpers",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or code execution",
  "flows": "Imported functions are listed in __all__ and could be used elsewhere; no direct data flow or execution paths within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated constructs detected. The imports are from legitimate utility modules.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of a module-level docstring, future import, an __all__ declaration, and imports from other modules. There are no functions or executable code that process data. The imported functions are standard utility functions that are likely safe. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python module structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a utility module that re-exports functions from other modules. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
