  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports systematically.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python module that:\n  - Contains a module docstring indicating utility functions/helpers.\n  - Uses `__future__.annotations` for type hints.\n  - Defines an `__all__` list exporting specific functions.\n  - Imports functions from internal modules within `objectory.utils`.\n\n**Security and Malware Analysis:**\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**\n   - The code only consists of import statements, a docstring, and an `__all__` list.\n   - No dynamic code execution, user input handling, network operations, or external command invocation.\n   - No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n   - All imports are from internal utility modules, suggesting a well-structured, benign codebase.\n\n2. **Potential Vulnerabilities:**\n   - Since the code merely imports functions and defines an export list, there are no apparent vulnerabilities.\n   - No signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n3. **Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n   - The reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0.\n   - These assessments are consistent with the code's content.\n\n4. **Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - Given the benign nature of the code, the scores seem appropriate.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - The analysis is cautious and justified.\n\n6. **Score Justification:**\n   - Malware: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n   - Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation patterns)\n   - Risk: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n- The code is a standard utility module with safe imports and no malicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned by the reports are accurate and justified.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code appears entirely benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
