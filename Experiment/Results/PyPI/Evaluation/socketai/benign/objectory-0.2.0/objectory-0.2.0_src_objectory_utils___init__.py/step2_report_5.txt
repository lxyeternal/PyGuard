  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward utility module that imports functions from the 'objectory' package and defines an `__all__` list.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input handling, network operations, or external data processing are present.\n- The code appears well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The confidence across all reports is high (1), and they uniformly conclude the code is benign.\n\n**Assessment of Issues:**\n- The code snippets are simple import statements and an `__all__` list with a module docstring.\n- No issues are present in the code; the reports correctly identify this as benign utility code.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since there are no vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors.\n\n**Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n- The reports do not assume any malicious intent or hidden backdoors, which aligns with the code.\n- No need to adjust scores; they are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- Based on the code snippet and the reports, the overall assessment aligns with a low malware, obfuscated, and security risk score.\n- Given the simplicity and the lack of any suspicious activity, I would agree with the current scores.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is a benign utility module with no security issues or malicious intent. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
