  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward utility module.\n   - It contains only import statements, a docstring, and an `__all__` list.\n   - No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or output operations are present.\n   - The functions imported are from internal utility modules within the `objectory` package, which appears to be a structured library.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - None of the reports detect any anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or signs of malicious behavior are observed.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or external commands.\n\n3. **Security Risks and Vulnerabilities**:\n   - Given the simplicity and static nature of the code, the risk of security issues is negligible.\n   - The code only re-exports functions from trusted internal modules.\n   - There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated score: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate considering the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence level is 1, which is justified given the consistent observations across reports.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Oversights**:\n   - The reports do not identify any issues with the code.\n   - Since the code is purely static and internal, there is no reason to adjust the scores upward.\n   - The code does not rely on untrusted input or perform any risky operations.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The code is a standard, benign utility module with no malicious intent or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are reasonable and justified.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My Overall Estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
