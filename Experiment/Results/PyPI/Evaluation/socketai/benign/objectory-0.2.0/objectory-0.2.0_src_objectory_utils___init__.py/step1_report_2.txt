{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and helpers related to object management, including class inspection, object instantiation, and name resolution.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from objectory.utils modules: config, name_resolution, and object_helpers.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "The imported functions are used as helpers; no execution of untrusted data or external commands observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module that defines an __all__ list and imports specific functions from other modules within objectory.utils. It uses future annotations for type hints, which is standard. There are no dynamic code executions, network communications, or other suspicious activities. All imports are from internal utility modules, indicating a structured, well-defined codebase. No anomalies or malicious intent are apparent based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module that imports helper functions. No malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are identified in this fragment.",
