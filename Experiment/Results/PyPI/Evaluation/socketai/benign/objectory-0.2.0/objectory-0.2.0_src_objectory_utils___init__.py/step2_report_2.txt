  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the corresponding reports step-by-step.\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code is a straightforward Python module that:\n     - Contains a docstring describing utility functions or helpers.\n     - Uses `__future__.annotations` for forward references.\n     - Defines an `__all__` list to specify exported functions.\n     - Imports several utility functions from internal modules within the `objectory.utils` package.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Aspects:**\n   - **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**  \n     The code only performs static imports and defines an export list. There are no dynamic code executions, no user inputs, no network calls, or file operations that could be exploited.\n   \n   - **Obfuscation or Secrets:**  \n     No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   \n   - **Potential Vulnerabilities:**  \n     Since the code only imports functions from internal utility modules, any vulnerabilities would depend on those modules. However, within this snippet, there's no indication of malicious intent or risky behavior.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1), and the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero across reports.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:**  \n     Zero is appropriate; no malicious activity is detected.\n   \n   - **Obfuscated Score:**  \n     Zero; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   \n   - **Risk Score:**  \n     Zero; the code is a simple utility module with no security implications.\n\n5. **Critical Evaluation:**\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly identifies the code as benign.\n   - The only consideration is the trustworthiness of the imported modules, but within this snippet, they are standard utility imports.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n| Score Type     | Recommended Value | Justification                                               |\n|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                   | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                   | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.            |\n| Security Risk  | 0                   | No security vulnerabilities or risky operations.            |\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, standard utility module.\n- No changes needed to the existing scores.\n- The high confidence and zero risk scores are justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, the current scores are accurate and appropriate. The code poses no security risk, malware threat, or obfuscation concern.",
