{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for object handling, configuration checking, and name resolution, intended for internal use in a larger project.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from the 'objectory' library modules: config, name_resolution, and object_helpers.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks or operations that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive actions within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports utility functions and defines an __all__ list, which suggests these functions are intended to be used elsewhere in the project.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The import statements are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares a module docstring, imports specific functions from a third-party package 'objectory', and defines an explicit __all__ list for exported symbols. There are no data inputs, processing logic, or external interactions that could pose security risks. It appears to be a standard utility module with safe imports and no signs of malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a simple, safe utility stub that re-exports functions from the 'objectory' library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and appears to be for internal use only.",
