{
  "purpose": "A utility module that re-exports functions from internal utility packages for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules within 'objectory.utils'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import and export definitions only.",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely static import and export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, user input handling, network activity, or obfuscated patterns; straightforward structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module containing a docstring, a future import, an '__all__' list, and static imports from internal utility modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not perform any runtime actions, data processing, or external communication. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores set to zero. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these assessments, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are accurate and justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
