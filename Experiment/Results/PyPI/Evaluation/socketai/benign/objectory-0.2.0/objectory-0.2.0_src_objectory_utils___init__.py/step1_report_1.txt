{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions or helpers related to object management and name resolution.",
  "sources": "Import statements from objectory.utils modules, importing specific functions.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as the code is primarily import statements and module-level definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code appears to be standard utility imports with no unusual patterns or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of module documentation, import statements, and a list defining exported functions. It does not include any dynamic code execution, user input handling, or data transmission. The imported functions are from well-known utility modules, and the code only sets up an export list. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present, and there are no signs of obfuscation or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module defining utility functions with standard import statements. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
