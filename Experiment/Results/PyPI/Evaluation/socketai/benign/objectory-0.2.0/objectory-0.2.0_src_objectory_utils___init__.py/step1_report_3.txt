{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions or helpers related to object management and configuration.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and functions from the 'objectory' package, specifically from 'objectory.utils.config', 'objectory.utils.name_resolution', and 'objectory.utils.object_helpers'.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks for untrusted data or code execution within this code snippet. No network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports utility functions from external modules but does not invoke or execute any of these functions directly, so no data flow from source to sink occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, primarily importing functions and defining __all__. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. No dynamic execution or unusual patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a module with a docstring, a __all__ list, and imports several functions from the 'objectory' package. It appears to be a standard utility module intended to export specific helpers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The imports are from well-structured utility modules, and no suspicious code execution occurs within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module that imports and re-exports helper functions. There are no indications of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation. It appears safe based on this snippet.",
