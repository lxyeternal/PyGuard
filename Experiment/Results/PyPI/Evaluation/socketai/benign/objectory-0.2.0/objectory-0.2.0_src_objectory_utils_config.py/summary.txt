  "conclusion": "The code itself is safe and straightforward but poses security risks when handling untrusted input due to dynamic import and type hint evaluation. No malware or obfuscation is present. The current malware score of 0 is appropriate, but the potential for malicious code execution suggests increasing it slightly. The security risk score should be maintained at around 0.3-0.4, reflecting the risk of code execution if inputs are malicious. Overall, the code is not malicious but should be used with caution in untrusted contexts."
