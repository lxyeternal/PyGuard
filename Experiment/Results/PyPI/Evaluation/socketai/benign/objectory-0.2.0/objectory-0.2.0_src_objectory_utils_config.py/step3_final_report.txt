  "purpose": "Determine if the given configuration corresponds to a specific class by dynamically importing and inspecting the target object.",
  "sources": "The config dictionary's '_target_' key, which provides the import path; the import_object function that performs dynamic import; get_type_hints on functions to retrieve return annotations.",
  "sinks": "The import_object function, which executes code during import; get_type_hints, which can evaluate annotations that may contain code; potential use of untrusted input leading to code execution.",
  "flows": "Extraction of '_target_' from config -> import_object(target) -> if function, get_type_hints(target).get('return') -> check if cls in target.__mro__ or in union types.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of input validation or sanitization on the '_target_' string; reliance on dynamic import which can execute arbitrary code if input is malicious; no explicit security controls around import.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dynamic import based on external input, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if the input is maliciously crafted. It inspects return type hints of functions, which can evaluate annotations that may contain executable code. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present within the code itself. The security concern hinges on the trustworthiness of the '_target_' value. The current scores reflect the potential risk but could underestimate the threat if inputs are untrusted. Given the reliance on dynamic import and type hints, the code should be used cautiously in untrusted environments, and input validation is recommended.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is safe and straightforward but poses security risks when handling untrusted input due to dynamic import and type hint evaluation. No malware or obfuscation is present. The current malware score of 0 is appropriate, but the potential for malicious code execution suggests increasing it slightly. The security risk score should be maintained at around 0.3-0.4, reflecting the risk of code execution if inputs are malicious. Overall, the code is not malicious but should be used with caution in untrusted contexts.",
