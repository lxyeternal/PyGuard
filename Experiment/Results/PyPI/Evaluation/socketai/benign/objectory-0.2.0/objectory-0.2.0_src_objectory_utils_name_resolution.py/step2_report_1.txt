  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a name resolution utility that matches names against a set, with optional dynamic import via `import_object`.\n- The primary security concern is the use of `import_object(name)` which can import arbitrary modules/objects based on user-controlled input.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n- The code's logic is straightforward and does not contain suspicious or malicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Legitimate name resolution.\n- Key concern: `import_object()` could be exploited if `name` is untrusted.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.85\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The report correctly identifies that `import_object()` is a potential sink if `name` is untrusted.\n- No malware or malicious behavior is detected.\n- The low security risk score seems appropriate given the context.\n- The reasoning is sound, and the risk is minimal if inputs are controlled.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are reasonable.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Similar name resolution with dynamic import.\n- Key concern: `import_object(name)` could execute arbitrary code if `name` is malicious.\n- Malware score: 0.4\n- Security risk: 0.75\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The report emphasizes that `import_object()` is a critical sink and can lead to code execution.\n- It notes no validation on `name` before import.\n- The malware score of 0.4 might be slightly high; the code itself does not contain malware but could be exploited.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Since the code does not contain malware per se, but the potential for malicious exploitation exists, a malware score of **0.2-0.3** might be more appropriate.\n- The security risk score of 0.75 seems reasonable, given the potential for exploitation.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Malware score should be adjusted downward to ~0.2-0.3.**  \n**Security risk remains high but not at maximum.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Name resolution with dynamic import.\n- Key concern: `import_object()` can execute arbitrary code if `name` is malicious.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.3\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The report states no malware detected, which is accurate.\n- The main concern is the potential for malicious import if `name` is untrusted.\n- Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Name resolution, including dynamic import.\n- Key concern: `import_object()` can execute arbitrary code if `name` is malicious.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.6\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The report correctly highlights the risk of importing untrusted modules.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified because the code itself isn't malicious.\n- Security risk is higher, reflecting the potential for exploitation.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Similar name resolution.\n- Key concern: Dynamic import with untrusted input.\n- Malware score: 0.2\n- Security risk: 0.6\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The malware score of 0.2 is appropriate, as the code is not malicious but can be exploited.\n- The security risk score reflects the potential for malicious import if inputs are untrusted.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- The core issue across all reports is the potential for malicious exploitation via `import_object(name)` when `name` is untrusted.\n- The code does not contain malware or obfuscation.\n- The risk is primarily from dynamic import, which is a common concern in such utilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Given the code's nature, I would assign a **malware score of 0.1** — the code itself is benign, but the potential for malicious exploitation exists if `import_object()` is compromised or misused.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** I would set this around **0.3 to 0.4**, reflecting the potential for exploitation but not inherent maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 1       | 0.1     | 0            | 0.3    |\n| 2       | 0.2     | 0            | 0.4    |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.3    |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.3    |\n| 5       | 0.2     | 0            | 0.3    |\n\n**Note:** The main concern is the use of dynamic import (`import_object`) with untrusted input, which should be highlighted as a potential attack vector but does not constitute malware in itself.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate utility with a security consideration around dynamic import. The scores should reflect the potential for exploitation but not imply malicious code is present.",
