  "purpose": "Provides functions for resolving object names within a set of known object names, including importing objects dynamically if necessary.",
  "sources": "import_object(name) function call for dynamic import, input parameters (name, object_names, allow_import)",
  "sinks": "import_object(name) which could potentially execute untrusted code during dynamic import",
  "flows": "resolve_name calls find_matches (safe string matching), then may invoke import_object(name) if no direct match is found, potentially executing untrusted code",
  "anomalies": "Use of import_object(name) for dynamic import without explicit validation; no validation or sanitization of 'name' before import; reliance on import_object which can execute arbitrary code",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for name resolution, primarily matching object names within a set and optionally importing modules dynamically. The resolve_name function calls import_object with the provided 'name' if no match is found, which can lead to executing arbitrary code if 'name' is untrusted or malicious. There are no apparent checks or sanitization on 'name' before import, and the import_object function is a critical sink. The find_matches function only performs string matching based on the suffix, which is safe. However, the use of import_object for dynamic importing without validation poses a security risk, especially if 'name' comes from untrusted sources. The code appears to be intended for legitimate use but can be exploited if misused.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potential security risk in the dynamic import of modules using untrusted input without validation. This can lead to remote code execution if malicious names are supplied. Overall, it has a high risk of malicious behavior if exploited, mainly due to the import_object call.",
