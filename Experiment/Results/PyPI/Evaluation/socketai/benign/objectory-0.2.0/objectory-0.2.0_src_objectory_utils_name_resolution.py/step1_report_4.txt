{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for resolving object names within a set of known object names, including importing objects dynamically if needed.",
  "sources": "Import statements, particularly 'import_object' from objectory.utils.object_helpers, and the function resolve_name which may invoke import_object.",
  "sinks": "The import_object function, which dynamically imports modules or objects based on string names, could potentially lead to malicious code execution if the import source is compromised or manipulated.",
  "flows": "Input string 'name' flows into resolve_name, which may trigger import_object; the result is used to determine the returned name or None.",
  "anomalies": "The use of import_object to import potentially arbitrary objects based on string input can be risky, especially if 'name' is influenced by untrusted sources. No explicit validation or sanitization of 'name' is performed before import.",
  "analysis": "The code offers name resolution functionality with the ability to import objects dynamically if they are not found in the provided set. The function 'resolve_name' relies on 'import_object' which imports modules or objects based on string names. If 'name' is provided by an untrusted source, this could lead to remote code execution or execution of malicious code during import. The 'find_matches' function only performs string comparisons and does not execute code. The overall security concern centers on the dynamic import feature, which can be exploited if used improperly.",
  "conclusion": "While the core logic is standard for name resolution, the use of 'import_object' introduces a potential security risk if 'name' is untrusted. No validation or sanitization is evident, making this a possible attack vector for malicious imports. The rest of the code appears benign and does not exhibit malicious intent.",
