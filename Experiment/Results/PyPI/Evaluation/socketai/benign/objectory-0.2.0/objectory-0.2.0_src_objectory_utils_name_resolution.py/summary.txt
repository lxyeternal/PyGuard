  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate name resolution utility that relies on dynamic import, which poses a security risk if 'name' is untrusted. No malware or obfuscation is present. The scores should reflect the potential for malicious exploitation via unvalidated dynamic import, with malware scores around 0.2-0.3, obfuscation score at 0, and risk scores around 0.6. Proper validation of 'name' would mitigate this risk."
