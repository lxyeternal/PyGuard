  "purpose": "Name resolution utility that matches a query name against a set of object names, with optional dynamic import to resolve ambiguous names.",
  "sources": "The function resolve_name calls import_object(name) which may import modules or objects based on the input name.",
  "sinks": "The import_object(name) function acts as a sink where untrusted input can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' is checked against object_names; if not found, find_matches is called; if still unresolved, import_object(name) is invoked; if import succeeds, the object name is returned.",
  "anomalies": "Use of import_object(name) without validation or sanitization of 'name' introduces a potential security risk; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward name resolution with optional dynamic import. The primary security concern is that 'import_object' can execute arbitrary code if 'name' is malicious or untrusted. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The risk is inherent in dynamic import mechanisms, especially if 'name' can be influenced by external or untrusted sources. The malware score should reflect the potential for malicious exploitation via this import, but the code itself is benign. The scores across the reports are consistent with this assessment, with higher risk scores (around 0.6) justified by the potential for exploitation, and low malware scores (around 0.2) appropriate given the absence of embedded malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate name resolution utility that relies on dynamic import, which poses a security risk if 'name' is untrusted. No malware or obfuscation is present. The scores should reflect the potential for malicious exploitation via unvalidated dynamic import, with malware scores around 0.2-0.3, obfuscation score at 0, and risk scores around 0.6. Proper validation of 'name' would mitigate this risk.",
