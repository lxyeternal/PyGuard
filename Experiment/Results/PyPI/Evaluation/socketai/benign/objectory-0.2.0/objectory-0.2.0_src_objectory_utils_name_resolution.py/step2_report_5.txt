  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements name resolution, with dynamic import as a potential risk. No malicious behavior detected; low security risk.\n\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that `import_object()` is the main concern if `name` is untrusted. The risk score is 0.2, which seems reasonable given the low likelihood of malicious intent unless inputs are untrusted.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound, and the score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights that `import_object()` can execute arbitrary code if `name` is malicious, with a high security risk score of 0.75 and malware score of 0.4.\n\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that dynamic import is a critical sink. The risk score of 0.75 is justified because untrusted input to `import_object()` can lead to remote code execution.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.4 — indicates some suspicion but not definitive malware. This seems reasonable given the potential for malicious code execution.\n\n- **Justification for higher scores:** Since dynamic import can lead to code execution, assigning a risk score above 0.5 is justified. The malware score of 0.4 is moderate, reflecting potential malicious behavior if exploited.\n\n- **Verdict:** Well-reasoned, appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizing that `import_object()` can be malicious if compromised. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes that reliance on external functions for dynamic import is a concern but does not assume malicious intent. Malware score is 0, which is conservative and acceptable given no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 — aligns with the potential risk if `import_object()` is compromised, but no evidence suggests malicious activity.\n\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the security risk posed by unvalidated dynamic import via `import_object()`.\n\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that untrusted `name` can lead to arbitrary code execution. The risk score of 0.6 is appropriate, given the potential for exploitation.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of confirmed malicious activity but acknowledges the risk.\n\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar concerns about dynamic import and untrusted input, with a risk score of 0.6 and malware score of 0.2.\n\n- **Analysis:** The malware score is lower here, possibly underestimating the risk. Since `import_object()` can execute arbitrary code if `name` is malicious, a malware score closer to 0.4-0.5 might be more appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict:** Slightly conservative on malware scoring but overall acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- The core concern across all reports is the use of `import_object()` with untrusted input, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. The risk scores reflect this, with higher scores (0.6-0.75) where the potential for exploitation is emphasized.\n\n- The malware scores are generally low (0-0.4), which is reasonable given no evidence of malicious code in the static code provided.\n\n- No evidence of obfuscation or actual malware is present in the code.\n\n- The reasoning is consistent across reports, and the scores are appropriate considering the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** I would assign a **0.2-0.3** if considering the potential for malicious activity via malicious inputs, but since no malicious code is observed, **0** remains reasonable.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential for exploitation if inputs are untrusted, I would set it around **0.6**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | My Estimate | Justification                                                  |\n|------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0.2 - 0.3    | Potential for malicious code if `import_object()` is exploited. No evidence of actual malware. |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | Clear, straightforward code.                                  |\n| Security Risk    | 0.6          | Dynamic import with untrusted input is a significant risk.   |\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate in identifying the main security concern—the use of dynamic import with untrusted input. The scores are generally appropriate, with slight room for adjustment on malware scoring depending on threat model. Overall, the code is benign but has a notable security consideration if inputs are not sanitized.",
