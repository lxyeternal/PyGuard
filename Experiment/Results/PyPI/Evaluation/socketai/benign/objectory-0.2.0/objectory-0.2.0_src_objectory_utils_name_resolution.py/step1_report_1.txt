  "purpose": "The code implements a name resolution mechanism for finding and importing Python object names within a set of registered object names, primarily to resolve ambiguous or partial names.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function arguments `name`, `object_names`, and potentially through dynamic import via `import_object(name)`.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the `import_object(name)` function call which could import arbitrary modules or objects, and the `full_object_name(obj)` which might access or manipulate object metadata. No direct unsafe data handling or external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input `name` is checked against existing object names; if not found, `find_matches()` is used to narrow down candidates; if a single match is found, it is returned. If not, an attempt is made to import the object dynamically; if successful and allowed, the object's full name is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution. The only potentially risky operation is dynamic import (`import_object(name)`), which if not properly secured, could be exploited to load malicious modules if the package or environment is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily straightforward, resolving names within a set, with optional dynamic import to resolve names not found in the set. The use of `import_object()` introduces a potential risk if the `name` parameter is controlled by an untrusted source, as it may cause arbitrary code execution through malicious modules. The `full_object_name()` is used after import, which generally is safe if the imported object is legitimate. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is present. The code's purpose is to facilitate name resolution, not to perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to object name resolution. The only notable concern is the dynamic import operation, which could be exploited if user-controlled input is not sanitized. However, within the scope of this code, there is no explicit malicious behavior or malware detected. The overall security risk is low, assuming controlled inputs.",
