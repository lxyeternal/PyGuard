  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for an object factory package to handle various error scenarios.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs, no reading from untrusted sources, no environment variables or network calls.",
  "sinks": "None present; all classes are exception definitions without any sink operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of custom exception classes used within a Python package. It contains no dynamic code execution, no input handling, or network operations. All classes inherit from Exception and have docstrings explaining their purpose. The code appears to be purely structural with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class definitions module with no malicious intent, no suspicious data handling, and no security concerns.",
