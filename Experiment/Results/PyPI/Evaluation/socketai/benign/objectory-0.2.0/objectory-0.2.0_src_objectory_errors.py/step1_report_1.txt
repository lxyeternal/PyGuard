{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes related to a factory pattern implementation, primarily for error handling and validation within an object factory framework.",
  "sources": "The code sources input through class inheritance and exception definitions, with no external data reading or user input processing.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior or leaks, as the code only defines exception classes and constants.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code purely defines exception classes without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is straightforward and consistent with standard Python conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of custom exception classes for a factory pattern, each inheriting from a base FactoryError. It includes descriptive docstrings and a list of all exported names. No external data sources, user inputs, or dynamic code execution are present. The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or environment variable access. It appears to be a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions intended for use in a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security-related issues. It does not exhibit any suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The overall security risk is negligible.",
