{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a factory pattern implementation, primarily for error handling and input validation.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code solely defines classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, storage, or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows involved; only class and exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code consists of standard exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations, declares a list of public names, and defines several custom exception classes inheriting from Exception or a base FactoryError. All classes are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or external calls. The docstrings are standard and do not suggest malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be standard for defining exception hierarchy in a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical exception class hierarchy for a factory pattern, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It does not include any suspicious or malicious code segments.",
