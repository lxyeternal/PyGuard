  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for an object factory package to handle various error conditions.",
  "sources": "No external data input; all class definitions and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of class definitions and string documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for use within a factory pattern implementation. All classes inherit from a base FactoryError. The structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no handling of external input, and no suspicious constructs. There are no embedded malicious behaviors, such as network calls, file access, or code injection. The code appears to be purely for error handling and is standard practice in Python package development.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The package appears safe and unrelated to supply chain or malware issues.",
