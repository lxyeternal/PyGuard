{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a factory pattern implementation, serving as error indicators within a larger application.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, user input, environment variables, or network calls; purely class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows, external outputs, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static class definitions without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-structured, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with descriptive docstrings and an exported list. It contains no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or malicious patterns. The classes are standard for error handling in Python, and the code is static and clear. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are justified given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard exception hierarchy with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
