  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines a set of custom exception classes for a factory pattern implementation.\n   - All classes inherit from `Exception` or a base `FactoryError`.\n   - The code includes descriptive docstrings, a list of exported names, and no dynamic or external data handling.\n   - There are no signs of code obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Security Implications**:\n   - The code is purely structural, intended for error handling.\n   - No external inputs, network operations, file I/O, or environment variable access are present.\n   - No suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, straightforward, and free of malicious intent.\n   - They emphasize the absence of external data handling, dynamic code, or obfuscation.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 in all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0, as the code is clear and standard.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0, since there's no security threat or vulnerability.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not assume any hidden malicious behavior; they base their conclusion on static code analysis.\n   - Given the simplicity and standard nature of the code, this assessment appears accurate.\n\n6. **Final Recommendation**:\n   - The code is a typical exception class hierarchy for a Python package.\n   - No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
