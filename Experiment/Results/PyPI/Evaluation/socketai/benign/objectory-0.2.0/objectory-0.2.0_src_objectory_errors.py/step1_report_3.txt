  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a factory pattern implementation in Python.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, exception class declarations",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely class and exception definitions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward Python class definitions for exceptions related to a factory pattern. It includes typical exception class structures inheriting from Exception, with docstrings explaining their purpose. There are no inputs, outputs, or external data handling mechanisms. No signs of malicious behavior such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. The code is well-structured and standard for defining exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for a factory design pattern. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
