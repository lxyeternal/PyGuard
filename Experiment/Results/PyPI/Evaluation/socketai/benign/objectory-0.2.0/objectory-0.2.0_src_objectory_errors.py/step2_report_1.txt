  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - The code solely defines custom exception classes for a factory pattern.\n   - No external data sources, network calls, file I/O, or environment variable access.\n   - No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.\n   - The classes inherit from Exception, with descriptive docstrings, and are intended for error handling within a larger application.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n   - No suspicious data flows, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n   - The code is standard, straightforward, and well-structured.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0 or very low (0.0 or 0.1). Given the code's nature, this is reasonable. No part of the code introduces security vulnerabilities or supply chain risks.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Misjudgments**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - No overestimation of risk or malicious activity.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code's actual content.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is purely for exception handling, it is inherently low risk.\n   - The consistent scores across reports reinforce that there are no hidden issues.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a standard, non-malicious set of exception class definitions.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of any security concerns.",
