  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dynamic factory pattern with no inherent malicious behavior. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of external utility functions and validation of '_target_'. If these are secure and inputs are validated, the risk is minimal. Overall, the code itself is safe, but external factors could introduce vulnerabilities."
