  "purpose": "Dynamically instantiate objects given their string identifier and parameters.",
  "sources": "import_object(_target_): reads the string identifier to import a target object; the *args and **kwargs are passed to instantiate_object.",
  "sinks": "instantiate_object(target, *args, _init_=_init_, **kwargs): potentially executes constructor or method on imported object; import_object could execute arbitrary code if malicious input is provided.",
  "flows": "Input string _target_ flows into import_object(), which loads a module/class; the result flows into instantiate_object along with args, kwargs, and init method.",
  "anomalies": "Use of import_object with externally provided target string could lead to arbitrary code execution if untrusted input is supplied; no validation or sandboxing appears to be in place.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a factory function that imports a target object based on a string, then instantiates it using a helper function. The import_object function is critical—if it executes untrusted code or imports malicious modules, it could lead to security issues. The code itself does not contain hardcoded credentials or malicious code, but the reliance on dynamic import from external input is a potential security risk. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior within this code fragment, but the dynamic import step is sensitive.\n\nThe main concern is that if _target_ is controlled by an attacker, they could force the function to import malicious modules or execute malicious code, especially if import_object executes arbitrary code upon import or if instantiate_object invokes dangerous methods. The code itself is straightforward and appears legitimate, but its security heavily depends on the implementation and trustworthiness of import_object and instantiate_object.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a dynamic object factory relying on external input to determine what to import and instantiate. While the code structure is standard and does not inherently contain malicious behavior, the use of dynamic import based on external strings introduces a potential security risk if untrusted input is processed without validation. No malware or obfuscation is present in this fragment. Overall, the code is relatively safe if used with trusted inputs but could be risky if inputs are untrusted.",
