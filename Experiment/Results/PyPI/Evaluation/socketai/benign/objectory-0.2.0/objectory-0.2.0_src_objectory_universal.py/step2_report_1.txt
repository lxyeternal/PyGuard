  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The `factory` function dynamically imports an object (class or function) specified by a string `_target_`.\n- It uses external utilities `import_object` and `instantiate_object`.\n- It performs a check if the imported object is `None` and raises an error if so.\n- The function relies heavily on external functions, which are not provided here.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate.\n- **Security concerns:** No malicious behavior observed; relies on external functions.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. The low malware and security risk scores align with the analysis. The confidence is high, given the straightforward nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Security concerns:** Highlights potential risks if `import_object` or `instantiate_object` are malicious or allow arbitrary code execution.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.4, confidence=0.7.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The report emphasizes the reliance on external functions and untrusted input, which is valid. The security risk is higher than report 1, reflecting the potential danger.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to report 2, with emphasis on the dynamic import risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.4, confidence=0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reasoning.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar analysis; emphasizes potential for malicious code if inputs are untrusted.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.4, confidence=0.7.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar overall conclusion; no malicious code within this snippet.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower security risk, which is acceptable given the reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The code itself does not contain malicious logic; risks are external and depend on the implementation of `import_object` and `instantiate_object`. No signs of obfuscation or malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Security risk scores:** Range from 0.2 to 0.4. Given the reliance on external functions and dynamic import based on untrusted input, a risk of 0.4 is justified if inputs are untrusted, which is the typical case.\n\n- **Confidence levels:** Mostly high (0.7-0.9), which is reasonable given the straightforward analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code appears to be a standard dynamic factory pattern with no inherent malicious behavior.\n- The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of `import_object` and `instantiate_object` and the nature of `_target_` input.\n- The scores reflect this, with malware=0 and moderate security risk when inputs are untrusted.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code present)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.3 (moderate, depending on input validation and utility implementation)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and reasonable. The code itself is safe but relies on external functions and untrusted input, which can introduce security issues if not properly handled. The scores appropriately reflect this.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The overall security assessment is that the code is safe in isolation but could be risky in untrusted contexts.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that `import_object` and `instantiate_object` are implemented securely, with proper validation and sandboxing if necessary.",
