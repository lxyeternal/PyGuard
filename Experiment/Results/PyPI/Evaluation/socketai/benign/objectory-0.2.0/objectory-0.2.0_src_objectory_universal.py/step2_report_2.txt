  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements a standard dynamic factory pattern, importing objects via `import_object` and instantiating via `instantiate_object`. No malicious behavior is evident; security depends on external functions' trustworthiness.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2, Obfuscated=0\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low malware and security risk scores are justified given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious signs. The confidence is high (0.9).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, but emphasizes that `import_object` and `instantiate_object` could be dangerous if they load malicious modules or execute untrusted code. The security risk is higher (0.4).\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.4, Obfuscated=0\n\n- **Assessment:** The caution about external functions is valid. The code itself doesn't show malicious behavior, but the reliance on external utilities that could be malicious or unsafe justifies a higher security risk score. The reasoning is reasonable; confidence is 0.7.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, similar analysis focusing on the dynamic import's potential risks if `_target_` is controlled by an attacker. No malware or obfuscation observed; the main concern is untrusted input leading to code execution.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.4, Obfuscated=0\n\n- **Assessment:** The focus on input validation and external utility trustworthiness is appropriate. The risk score aligns with the potential danger if inputs are malicious. Confidence is 0.8.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the main concern is the dynamic import and instantiation based on external input, which could lead to malicious code execution if inputs are untrusted. No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.4, Obfuscated=0\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; the risk assessment is reasonable. Confidence is 0.7.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, notes that the code relies on external utility functions and dynamic import, which could be risky if inputs are malicious, but no malicious activity is present in the code itself.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2, Obfuscated=0\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower security risk score (0.2) compared to others (0.4), perhaps reflecting a more optimistic view of external functions' safety. This is reasonable if those functions are well-secured.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code within this snippet. The external functions could be risky if malicious, but the code itself is benign. **Malware score should remain at 0.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward. **Obfuscated score should be 0.**\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** The main concern is the dynamic import and instantiation based on external input, which could lead to code execution if inputs are untrusted. Several reports assign 0.4, which seems appropriate. One report (number 5) assigns 0.2, perhaps slightly optimistic but still reasonable if external functions are trusted.\n\n**Given the consistent reasoning, I suggest:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.4 (high potential if inputs are untrusted; external functions' security is critical)\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\n\nThe overall security concern hinges on the trustworthiness of `import_object` and `instantiate_object`. If these are secure and inputs are validated, risks are minimal. If not, the code could be exploited to execute malicious code.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Suggested Score |\n|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                     |\n| Security Risk     | 0.4                   |\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is straightforward, with the main risk stemming from external factors rather than the code itself.",
