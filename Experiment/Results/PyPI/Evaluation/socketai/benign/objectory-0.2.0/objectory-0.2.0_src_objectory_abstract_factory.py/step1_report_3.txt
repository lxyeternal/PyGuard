  "purpose": "Define an abstract factory metaclass to create, register, and instantiate classes or functions dynamically, facilitating flexible object creation patterns.",
  "sources": "Imports from objectory.errors and objectory.utils modules; class attribute accesses; function parameters; import_object function for dynamic module loading; inspect module for class/function validation.",
  "sinks": "instantiate_object function call in factory method; import_object function in _abstractfactory_get_target_from_name; dynamic registration via register_object; dynamic name resolution; logging warnings on duplicate registration.",
  "flows": "Input target name -> _abstractfactory_resolve_name -> import_object (if needed) -> instantiate_object with class or function -> return created object",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import (import_object) and instantiate_object functions suggests flexibility but can be exploited if these functions are malicious or improperly implemented; no explicit hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or network connections are present in this code; dynamic registration and factory methods appear standard; no obfuscated code or misleading variable usage detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a metaclass AbstractFactory for creating and managing class/function registries, enabling dynamic instantiation. It relies on external utility functions for name resolution, import, and object instantiation, which are common in plugin architectures. The registration methods verify class/function validity, avoiding lambdas, and manage a registry dictionary. The factory method uses name resolution and dynamic import to instantiate objects. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, network access, or backdoors are evident within this code fragment. External functions (import_object, instantiate_object, resolve_name) are critical; if these are malicious, they could pose risks, but within this code, their usage appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a standard implementation of an abstract factory pattern with dynamic registration and instantiation capabilities. There are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The use of dynamic import and instantiation functions warrants caution if those external functions are compromised, but the code itself is clean, transparent, and typical for plugin-based architectures.",
