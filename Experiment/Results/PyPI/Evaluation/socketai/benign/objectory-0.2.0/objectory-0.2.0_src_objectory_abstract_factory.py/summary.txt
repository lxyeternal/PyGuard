  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation of an abstract factory pattern with appropriate safeguards. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The primary external risk involves the security of utility functions and imported modules, which are outside this code's scope. Overall, it appears safe for use in plugin architectures, assuming external functions are secure."
