{
  "purpose": "The code implements an abstract factory metaclass for dynamic object creation and registration, enabling flexible factory patterns with class/function registration and resolution mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Reads class definitions, method parameters (such as class names and objects), registration calls, and object import functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'instantiate_object' for dynamic object creation, 'import_object' for module imports, and 'resolve_name' for name resolution, which could be entry points for code execution if misused.",
  "flows": "Source: class definitions or registration functions -> resolve_name or import_object -> instantiate_object -> object creation or registration.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. Use of dynamic import and resolution functions could be misused for malicious code execution if external inputs are untrusted, but no explicit malicious code or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract factory pattern using a metaclass, enabling dynamic registration and instantiation of classes or functions. It carefully manages registrations, prevents registration of lambda functions, and provides mechanisms to resolve names, including importing modules. All functions perform expected checks, with proper exception handling for invalid operations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The dynamic import and name resolution functions are typical in plugin systems but could pose risks if fed malicious inputs. The code appears well-structured, standard, and intended for flexible extension rather than malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard, flexible abstract factory pattern with dynamic registration and resolution features. There are no signs of malicious intent or backdoors. It relies on external inputs for object creation, which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted, but within this code, no malicious behavior is detected. Overall, the code appears safe and purposefully designed for factory-based object management.",
