  "purpose": "Implement a registry class for dynamic object registration and instantiation, allowing flexible management of classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Code imports external modules, uses inspect, import_object, and resolve_name functions, and reads class attributes and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Uses instantiate_object with a target name, potentially importing and executing code; calls import_object which may import arbitrary modules; dynamic attribute access and name resolution may lead to code execution if malicious modules/classes are registered.",
  "flows": "Registry.factory() calls instantiate_object, which resolves the target name and may import and instantiate arbitrary classes or functions. register_object() stores objects, which can be later instantiated. __getattr__ dynamically creates sub-registries. _get_target_from_name() resolves and imports objects, potentially executing malicious code during import.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. Use of import_object and resolve_name functions could be risky if malicious modules are registered. The code forbids registration of lambda functions and enforces subclass filtering, reducing potential malicious registration. No obfuscation or obfuscated patterns are detected. No backdoors or hidden network connections are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard registry pattern with dynamic registration, object instantiation, and name resolution. It includes checks to prevent registration of lambda functions and enforces class inheritance constraints if a class filter is set. The import_object and resolve_name functions could, if misused, import malicious modules, but this relies on external, user-controlled data. No evidence of malware like data exfiltration, network communication, or system tampering is present. The use of import and dynamic attribute access is common in plugin architectures but can be exploited if malicious code is registered. Overall, the code structure appears safe, with security risks primarily dependent on external data and registration content.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a flexible object registry with dynamic import and instantiation capabilities. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident within the code itself. Security concerns are minimal and depend on what objects are registered. The code is well-structured, with safety checks and restrictions, and does not contain obfuscation or malware indicators.",
