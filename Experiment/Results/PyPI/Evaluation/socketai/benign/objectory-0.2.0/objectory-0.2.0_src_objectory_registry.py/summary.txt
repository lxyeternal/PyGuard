  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured registry implementation with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary risk stems from dynamic import and instantiation based on external inputs, which is a known and manageable risk in plugin systems. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk around 0.2 are justified and appropriate."
