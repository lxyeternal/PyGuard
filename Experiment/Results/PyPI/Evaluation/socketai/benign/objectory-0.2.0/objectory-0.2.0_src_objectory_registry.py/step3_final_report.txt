{
  "purpose": "The code implements a registry pattern allowing registration, retrieval, and dynamic instantiation of objects and functions, including nested registries and filtering capabilities.",
  "sources": "Reading class/function definitions, attribute access (__getattr__), name resolution via resolve_name, and dynamic instantiation/import via instantiate_object and import_object.",
  "sinks": "Calls to instantiate_object and import_object with user-provided names, which could execute arbitrary code if inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "Input names are resolved and potentially imported or instantiated, leading to execution points that depend on external input; no internal malicious code is present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code uses standard patterns with safeguards like lambda restrictions and class filtering.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical plugin-like registry with dynamic import and instantiation capabilities. It includes safeguards against lambda functions and enforces class filtering. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The main security concern is the potential misuse if untrusted inputs are provided to factory or import functions, which is inherent to such systems but not indicative of malicious intent within the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured registry implementation with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary risk stems from dynamic import and instantiation based on external inputs, which is a known and manageable risk in plugin systems. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk around 0.2 are justified and appropriate.",
