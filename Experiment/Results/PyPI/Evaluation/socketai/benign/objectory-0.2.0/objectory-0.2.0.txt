The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of external utility functions and validation of '_target_'. If these are secure and inputs are validated, the risk is minimal. Overall, the code itself is safe, but external factors could introduce vulnerabilities."

No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The primary external risk involves the security of utility functions and imported modules, which are outside this code's scope. Overall, it appears safe for use in plugin architectures, assuming external functions are secure."

The primary risk stems from dynamic import and instantiation based on external inputs, which is a known and manageable risk in plugin systems.

      "conclusion": "The code itself is safe and straightforward but poses security risks when handling untrusted input due to dynamic import and type hint evaluation. No malware or obfuscation is present. The current malware score of 0 is appropriate, but the potential for malicious code execution suggests increasing it slightly. The security risk score should be maintained at around 0.3-0.4, reflecting the risk of code execution if inputs are malicious. Overall, the code is not malicious but should be used with caution in untrusted contexts."

      "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a legitimate, safe utility module for class introspection, dynamic import, and object creation. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The potential risks are inherent to dynamic import and execution but are not exploited here. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), assuming trusted inputs. Overall, the code is suitable for secure environments with standard input validation when used with untrusted data."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate name resolution utility that relies on dynamic import, which poses a security risk if 'name' is untrusted. No malware or obfuscation is present. The scores should reflect the potential for malicious exploitation via unvalidated dynamic import, with malware scores around 0.2-0.3, obfuscation score at 0, and risk scores around 0.6. Proper validation of 'name' would mitigate this risk."
