  "purpose": "Utility functions for manipulating objects, including dynamic import, class inspection, and object instantiation.",
  "sources": "User input or external modules that call functions like import_object, instantiate_object, or pass objects to is_lambda_function.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe uses of dynamic import and instantiation, such as import_object and instantiate_object functions which execute external inputs or call constructors dynamically.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (like object_path) flows into import_object, which imports modules or objects; this can lead to calling arbitrary code during instantiation or import.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'tornado.util.import_object' for dynamic imports, which can execute arbitrary code if given malicious module paths; no explicit input validation beyond type checks; no explicit security controls in place. No evidence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides helper functions for introspection and dynamic object manipulation, including class hierarchies, object naming, and dynamic import/instantiation. The 'import_object' function uses 'tornado.util.import_object', which performs a standard dynamic import based on a string path, potentially executing arbitrary code if provided malicious input. The 'instantiate_object' function allows creating objects from classes or functions with arbitrary arguments, which could lead to code execution if misused, but relies on user-supplied parameters. No evidence of hidden malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious network activity is present. The use of standard library functions and well-known patterns suggests no malicious intent; however, the dynamic import mechanism is inherently risky if used with untrusted inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is mainly utility functions for object inspection and dynamic import/creation. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware but has potential security risks if user inputs to 'import_object' or 'instantiate_object' are not validated, as these can lead to arbitrary code execution. Overall, the code appears benign but should be used with caution in untrusted contexts.",
