  "purpose": "Utility functions for object manipulation, including class introspection, dynamic importing, and object instantiation.",
  "sources": "import_object (dynamic import), full_object_name (accessing __qualname__, __module__), all_child_classes (calling __subclasses__), is_lambda_function (checking __name__), instantiate_object (calling constructors and methods)",
  "sinks": "None directly appear to be vulnerable or malicious; all data manipulations are within standard safe operations such as attribute access, class instantiation, and import functions.",
  "flows": "import_object retrieves modules and objects; instantiate_object calls class constructors or functions; all_child_classes traverses class hierarchies; full_object_name constructs object identifiers; is_lambda_function checks function types",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Usage of external utility 'tornado.util.import_object' is standard for dynamic imports; no suspicious side-effects observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides well-structured utility functions for class and function introspection, dynamic importing, and object creation. It relies on Python's standard introspection modules (inspect) and safe practices. The only external dependency is 'tornado.util.import_object', which is designed for safe dynamic imports. There are no indications of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The functions perform standard, safe object manipulations and class hierarchy traversals. No suspicious patterns or potentially malicious behaviors are identified. The overall code appears to be a legitimate utility module with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for object handling and dynamic import operations with no signs of malicious behavior. The functions are safe, rely on standard Python practices, and do not contain any malicious side-effects or obfuscation. Therefore, it is considered safe with a low malware risk.",
