  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for object manipulation, including class discovery, dynamic import, and object instantiation.",
  "sources": "Reading class attributes (__subclasses__, __qualname__, __module__), inspecting object types, importing modules via tornado.util.import_object, calling functions or constructors.",
  "sinks": "Calling imported functions, instantiating classes with arbitrary arguments, executing function objects, dynamically importing objects, and executing potentially user-supplied code.",
  "flows": "Import object via import_object -> instantiate_object calls function or class -> class instantiation may invoke constructors (__init__, __new__) -> functions may execute arbitrary code",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of tornado's import_object could potentially load malicious modules if input is malicious, but this depends on external input. The code structure appears standard and non-obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code implements utility functions for class hierarchy discovery, obtaining full object names, dynamic importing, and object instantiation. It performs reflective inspection and dynamic execution of code objects. The use of tornado.util.import_object relies on external input strings for dynamic import, which could be risky if those inputs are untrusted, but in this context, it appears intended for controlled use. The functions for instantiation and class analysis are straightforward and do not contain malicious logic. No embedded malicious behaviors, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are detected. The code appears safe and standard for utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of standard utility functions for object inspection, dynamic import, and instantiation without any apparent malicious intent. The reliance on external input for dynamic import could pose a risk if inputs are untrusted, but within this code snippet, no malicious behavior is evident. Overall, the code is safe.",
