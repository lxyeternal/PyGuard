  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a legitimate, safe utility module for class introspection, dynamic import, and object creation. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The potential risks are inherent to dynamic import and execution but are not exploited here. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), assuming trusted inputs. Overall, the code is suitable for secure environments with standard input validation when used with untrusted data."
