  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external modules, input streams.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, files, system commands, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Sources to internal variables, then to sinks such as network or file system.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamic code execution (eval/exec), obfuscation, hardcoded URLs/credentials, suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate benign code with standard data handling and no suspicious activity. Report 3 shows obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion. Scores are consistent with the described behaviors: benign reports have malware=0, obfuscation=0, low security risk; Report 3 has moderate suspicion with malware=0.4, obfuscation=0.6, risk=0.6. The reasoning aligns with the evidence, and scores appropriately reflect the suspicion level.",
  "conclusion": "The majority of code appears safe, with Report 3 justifiably raising moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution. Scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating low overall risk but warranting attention to Report 3's patterns.",
