{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for DDSketch implementations, validating accuracy, merging, and distribution across various datasets.",
  "sources": "Data is generated from imported datasets within the 'tests.datasets' module, used internally within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or file outputs are present; data remains within the test environment and assertions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset generators to DDSketch objects via add() calls, then to validation assertions within the test methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external interactions are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of unit tests for DDSketch, involving multiple datasets and validation of statistical properties. It does not perform any external I/O, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The datasets are imported modules, and all data processing occurs in-memory. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assertions confirm correctness and consistency of the data structures. The code's purpose is purely internal validation, with no external dependencies involved in untrusted data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for DDSketch implementations, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk.",
