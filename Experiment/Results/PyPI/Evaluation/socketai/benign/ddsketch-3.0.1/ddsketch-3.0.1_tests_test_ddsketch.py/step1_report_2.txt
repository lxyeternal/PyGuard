{
  "purpose": "This code is a set of unit tests for the DDSketch data structure implementation, verifying accuracy, merging behavior, and distribution handling.",
  "sources": "The code sources include distribution datasets imported from 'tests.datasets' and test parameters. No external or untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "The code performs mathematical operations and data comparisons, primarily within the test assertions. There are no data leaks, network communications, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset generators into DDSketch instances via the 'add' method, and the tests compare the sketch's outputs to expected distribution quantiles. No untrusted data is propagated to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The code appears standard for a testing suite. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive testing suite for DDSketch, validating functionality across various distributions and merge behaviors. It relies on imported datasets and uses standard assertion patterns. No external inputs or malicious code execution paths are present. All operations are confined within the test environment, and there is no evidence of data exfiltration, system interference, or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing suite with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs correctness verification of DDSketch implementations without any suspicious or harmful code.",
