{
  "purpose": "Unit testing framework for DDSketch data structure implementations, including accuracy and merge behavior validations.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (numpy, pytest, six), test datasets, and the code itself (e.g., data inputs via dataset class instances).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; primarily in-memory data processing and assertions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset generators into DDSketch instances via the add() method, then queried for quantiles and statistics; no external data flows are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The code appears standard for testing purposes, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract and concrete test classes for DDSketch implementations, including accuracy checks, merging, and distribution testing. No external network or file operations occur, and data is handled internally. The functions use standard Python and testing libraries with well-defined, typical data flow. No anomalies or malicious behavior are present. The purpose is strictly testing the correctness of DDSketch implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate test suite for DDSketch, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It solely performs in-memory data generation, manipulation, and validation. No suspicious signals detected.",
