  "purpose": "Implementations of DDSketch for approximate quantile calculations with different memory and accuracy trade-offs.",
  "sources": "Imports from .mapping and .store modules, class constructors, and method parameters such as mapping, store, and zero_count.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data directly; functions mainly perform calculations, merges, and data structure manipulations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'add' method inputs into internal stores and summary statistics, then can be retrieved via get_quantile_value. Merging flows combine data from multiple sketches.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard data structure operations and mathematical calculations. No network operations or file I/O are present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for approximate quantile sketching using logarithmic mapping and various store implementations. It handles data addition, merging, and quantile estimation with no evident malicious or suspicious behaviors. The imports are from local modules, suggesting modular design. No use of environment variables, external network calls, or file access is detected. The structure is straightforward, with typical class methods and properties for statistical summaries. Overall, the code performs legitimate statistical sketching functions, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of DDSketch for approximate quantile estimation, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It functions as intended for data summarization without exposing or mishandling sensitive information.",
