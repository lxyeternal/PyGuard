{
  "purpose": "The code implements a DDSketch data structure for approximate quantile computation with relative-error guarantees, including various storage strategies for efficiency and accuracy control.",
  "sources": "Data is read through the 'add' method which takes input values and weights, and internal data structures such as stores and mappings process these inputs.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs include quantile values via 'get_quantile_value', and merges via 'merge'. No untrusted external outputs or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input values are added via 'add' method; they are mapped to bins and stored in store objects. Quantile computations access stored data; merge operations combine internal states.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are detected. The code appears to follow standard design patterns for approximate data sketches. No obfuscated code, runtime code generation, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes for DDSketch implementations, including standard and collapsing variants, with typical initialization, add, merge, and quantile retrieval methods. It uses imported modules for mappings and storage that seem standard. The 'add' method validates weight and processes positive, negative, and zero values correctly. No suspicious data handling, external calls, or insecure operations are identified. The merging functions check for compatibility and correctly combine data structures. Overall, the code aligns with a standard approximate quantile sketch implementation without signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of DDSketch for approximate quantile computation, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It uses standard data structures and algorithms, and no suspicious patterns are evident.",
