  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of DDSketch for approximate quantile estimation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the data structure. The reports are consistent and accurate."
