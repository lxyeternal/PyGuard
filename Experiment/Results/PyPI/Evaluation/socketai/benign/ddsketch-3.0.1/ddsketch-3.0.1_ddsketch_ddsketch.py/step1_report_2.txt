{
  "purpose": "The code implements a quantile sketch data structure (DDSketch) for approximate percentile queries with relative error guarantees, used for streaming data analysis and monitoring.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the add() method which takes float values and weights.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data outside the module; it only processes data internally within the data structure.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into add() which updates the sketch's internal bins and stats; get_quantile_value() retrieves approximate quantiles based on internal store and store negative values.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No network operations, hidden data exfiltration, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a statistical data structure. No unusual code behavior or security flaws are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a quantile sketch, with different variants for memory and accuracy trade-offs. It uses well-understood algorithms and data structures, with no suspicious external calls, network activity, or embedded malicious logic. All data processing appears to be for statistical computation, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code follows typical design patterns for such data structures and includes only safe, well-defined operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a DDSketch data structure, used for approximate quantile calculations. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The structure, functions, and data flow are consistent with legitimate statistical analysis code.",
