{
  "purpose": "Implementation of DDSketch, a probabilistic data structure for approximate quantile estimation with relative-error guarantees, supporting both positive and negative input values.",
  "sources": "Input values via the 'add' method, reading from function arguments; internal store objects for bin counts.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or external outputs; purely internal data handling.",
  "flows": "Values are added through 'add', mapped to bins, stored in positive or negative stores; 'get_quantile_value' retrieves approximate quantiles based on internal counts and ranks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected; implementation follows standard algorithms and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a well-known statistical data structure with clear, straightforward logic. It reads input data via 'add', updates internal stores, and computes approximate quantiles. No external network calls, no obfuscation, and no signs of malicious intent. The merging functions combine internal states correctly. The code is modular, with variants supporting limited bin counts via collapsing stores. Overall, the implementation aligns with academic references and open-source standards, with no suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of DDSketch for approximate quantile estimation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the data structure. The reports are consistent and accurate.",
