  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'ddsketch', configuring metadata, dependencies, and versioning.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, defines package data, dependencies, and version control via 'setuptools_scm'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external network activity, or code execution points present.",
  "flows": "Reading README file; defining package metadata; invoking setuptools.setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious patterns. It reads a README file, specifies package info, dependencies, and versioning. No external data handling or network activity is involved. All dependencies are static and well-defined. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, with a minor adjustment to set the security risk to 0 for consistency.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The slight elevation in security risk score (0.1) in one report can be adjusted to 0 for accuracy.",
