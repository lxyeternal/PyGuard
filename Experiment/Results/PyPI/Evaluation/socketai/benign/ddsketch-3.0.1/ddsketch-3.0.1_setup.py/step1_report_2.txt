  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'ddsketch' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md' for long_description; hardcoded strings for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains sinks that process untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Reads external README file -> uses setuptools to configure package setup parameters -> dependencies are specified statically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. Uses standard setup.py structure.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: reading a README file, defining package metadata, dependencies, and configuration options. No dynamic code execution, no external input handling beyond reading a static file, and no suspicious network activity or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks within this script.",
