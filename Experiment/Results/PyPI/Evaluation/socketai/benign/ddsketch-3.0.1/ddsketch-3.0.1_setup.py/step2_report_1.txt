  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided setup code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the setup script is standard, reading a README file and configuring package metadata.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected across reports.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report (report 4) assigning a very low risk of 0.1, which seems reasonable given the script's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code is straightforward, with no apparent vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- No code injection, external network activity, or handling of untrusted data is present.\n- The dependencies are static and well-defined.\n- The use of `setuptools_scm` for versioning is standard.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears benign and correctly implemented for its purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- **No errors or flaws** are evident in the reports' reasoning or summaries.\n- The assessments are consistent and accurate regarding the nature of the setup script.\n- The only minor point is that report 4 assigns a security risk of 0.1, which might be slightly conservative but still acceptable given the context.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** The scores are mostly 0, with one report at 0.1. This is reasonable, as the script does not perform any risky operations.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since the code is purely a setup script with no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation, **risk scores higher than 0.1** are unwarranted.\n- The malware score should remain 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes are necessary in the scoring or analysis.\n- The code is safe, with no security risks or malware.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or at most 0.1 for conservative caution)\n\n**Summary:** The setup script is standard, safe, and poses no security threat. All reports correctly identify this, and no further action is needed.",
