{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'ddsketch' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description, and defines package dependencies and metadata directly within the setup script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leak points are evident; no code execution or data handling beyond standard package setup.",
  "flows": "Reads external files for description; specifies static dependencies; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard setup script with no obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "This script performs typical package setup operations using setuptools, reading a README file, specifying dependencies, and configuring metadata. It does not include any code that could be exploited or malicious. No source-to-sink data flows are present that would pose a security threat. The code strictly adheres to conventional setup procedures without anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. It functions solely to configure and install the package 'ddsketch'.",
