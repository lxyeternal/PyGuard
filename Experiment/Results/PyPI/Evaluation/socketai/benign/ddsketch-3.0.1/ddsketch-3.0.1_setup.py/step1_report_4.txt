{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'ddsketch' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; reads setup parameters; reads dependencies; reads version info via 'setuptools_scm'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks identified; no network or external command execution; no credential handling.",
  "flows": "Reads from local files to gather package metadata and dependencies, then passes this data to setuptools for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or hardcoded secrets; standard setup script structure.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup operations: reading README for description, defining package metadata, dependencies, and version control. All operations are read-only and conform to standard practices. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident; it does not execute untrusted code, connect to external services dynamically, or handle sensitive data insecurely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution.",
