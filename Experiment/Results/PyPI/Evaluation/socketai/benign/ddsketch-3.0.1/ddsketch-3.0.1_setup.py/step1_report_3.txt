{
  "purpose": "Set up the Python package 'ddsketch' with metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; static setup configuration data",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no external data outputs or network activity",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the file to assigning variables, then into the setup() function",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; standard setup script",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading a README file for description, defining package metadata, dependencies, and build options. All operations involve static data and standard library functions; no dynamic code execution or external inputs are present. No indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is unlikely to be malicious or pose any security threat.",
