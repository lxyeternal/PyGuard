  "purpose": "Unit tests for various KeyMapping classes in the ddsketch.mapping module, verifying accuracy, offsets, and mathematical correctness.",
  "sources": "In-memory calculations, function calls, and assertions within the test suite; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or system interactions; purely in-memory operations and assertions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (relative accuracy, offset) to mapping class constructors, with internal method calls for validation; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected; straightforward testing code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs systematic validation of mathematical properties for mapping classes, including accuracy and offset handling. It uses standard libraries (numpy, pytest) and simple assertions. No external data, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The functions are well-structured, and the purpose is clearly for correctness verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for mathematical mapping classes with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is well-structured, with no anomalies or obfuscation, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
