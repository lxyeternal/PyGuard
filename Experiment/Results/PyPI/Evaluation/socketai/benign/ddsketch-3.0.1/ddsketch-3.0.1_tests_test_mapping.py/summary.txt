  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for mathematical mapping classes with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is well-structured, with no anomalies or obfuscation, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and justified."
