{
  "purpose": "This code defines various dataset classes for generating numerical data, primarily for testing or simulation purposes, including uniform, normal, exponential, and other distributions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class properties, method parameters, and numpy's random functions. It also reads class attributes for configuration.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system commands. Data is generated internally and returned as lists or numpy arrays.",
  "flows": "Data flows from data generation methods (e.g., numpy.random functions) to the return statements, with class attributes influencing distributions. No external input flows directly into these functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No unusual or malicious code behavior detected. Use of numpy's random functions is standard for data generation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple dataset classes with different data generation strategies, including deterministic sequences and stochastic distributions. The functions utilize numpy for randomness, and class attributes configure distribution parameters. No external or untrusted data input occurs, and no code appears to perform malicious actions such as data exfiltration, network access, or system modification. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate collection of dataset generators for testing purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or supply chain sabotage. It is safe based on the provided content.",
