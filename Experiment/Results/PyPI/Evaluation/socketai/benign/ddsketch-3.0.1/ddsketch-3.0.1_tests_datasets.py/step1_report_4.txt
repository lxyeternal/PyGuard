{
  "purpose": "Define various synthetic datasets for testing or analysis, providing methods to generate and manipulate numerical data.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user-defined parameters such as size, ratio, loc, and scale; random data generation functions like np.random.*; no external untrusted data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Data is stored in class attributes; no data is sent to external servers or written to files; no untrusted data flows to dangerous sinks.",
  "flows": "Parameters influence data generation; generated data stored in self.data; no external or untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets (except fixed constants), or unusual behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for various datasets, primarily generating numerical data using deterministic logic or NumPy's random functions. Methods like populate() generate data based on parameters or fixed sequences, with no external input or side effects. Random seed handling is not managed, but no external data is fetched or sent. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The only potential concern is the use of random functions, but these are standard for data generation purposes. Overall, the code appears to serve legitimate purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides a suite of data generator classes for testing or analytical purposes. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. The implementation is straightforward and aligned with common data simulation practices. No security risks or malware are detected.",
