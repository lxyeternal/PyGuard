{
  "purpose": "The code defines various dataset generator classes for creating numerical data, including random, uniform, normal, and custom distributions, primarily for testing or simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "Data generation occurs via class methods like np.random functions, generator methods (yield), and properties accessing class variables.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted input/output functions are present; data is generated internally with no network, file, or environment variable interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows originate from data generation methods (np.random, yield) within class methods, with no external untrusted sources influencing these flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes class methods to set parameters dynamically (from_params) which modify class variables, but no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are observed. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior is present. Use of np.random without seeding is normal for stochastic datasets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of dataset classes generating data via standard numpy functions and Python generators. The class methods enable customizable data creation for testing, with no external input, network activity, or system manipulation. No code suggests malicious intent or sabotage; the structure is straightforward, and all data flows are internal. The use of class variables for parameters is standard but does not pose security risks. No hardcoded secrets, no file/network operations, and no obfuscated or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides dataset generators for testing and simulation purposes without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate data creation tasks.",
