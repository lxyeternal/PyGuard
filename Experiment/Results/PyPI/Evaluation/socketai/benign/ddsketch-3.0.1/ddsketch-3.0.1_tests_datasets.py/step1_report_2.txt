{
  "purpose": "The code defines various dataset classes for data generation, including synthetic distributions and sequences, for use in data analysis or testing.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are primarily from parameters, random number generators (e.g., np.random), and internal methods. No external untrusted input is directly read.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data returned from np.random functions and data stored within class attributes. No external data sinks or network communication present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from parameter inputs or random generators into dataset attributes and methods, with no external data transfer or side effects observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are evident. Usage of class-level mutable state in class methods is noted but not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code or code injection patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of dataset generator classes, mostly using numpy and random functions for data creation. No network, file I/O, or external input reading occurs. No suspicious logic, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of class attributes for parameters is typical for such utility classes. Randomness is used for statistical distributions, which is normal in data generation contexts. No signs of malware such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system compromise are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data generation utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly creates synthetic datasets for testing or analysis purposes. No security threats or malware behaviors are identified.",
