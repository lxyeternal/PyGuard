{
  "purpose": "The code defines various dataset classes for generating numerical data for testing or analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters such as size, ratio, and distribution parameters; internal methods generating data.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is sent over the network, written to files, or executed as code from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from parameter inputs to data generation methods, which produce datasets. No external data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets. Usage of class methods that set class variables (like from_params) could be risky if misused, but in this context, it appears intended for flexible configuration. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of dataset generator classes using numpy for random data. It includes both deterministic sequences and random distributions. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, file access, or code execution. The code appears to be for data generation, with methods for configuring distribution parameters. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic are present. The structure is straightforward, and the purpose aligns with data simulation for testing or analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed for generating datasets for testing purposes. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks. The code is well-structured and straightforward.",
