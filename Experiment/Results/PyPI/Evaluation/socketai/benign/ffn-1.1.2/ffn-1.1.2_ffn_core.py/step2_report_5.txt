  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential malicious behaviors, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no malicious code, and notes standard libraries and patterns typical for financial analysis.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low, possibly due to file I/O or plotting, but not malicious)\n- **Justification:** The code is extensive but straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent. The low security risk score seems reasonable, given that plotting and file writing are standard but could potentially be misused if misconfigured.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the reviewer emphasizes the standard nature of the code, with no malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Justification:** The code is a typical financial analysis library, with no network activity, no external command execution, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the reviewer finds no malicious or suspicious behaviors, highlighting the standard use of libraries and typical patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious intent, no obfuscation, no hidden behaviors.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer confirms the code is a legitimate, comprehensive financial analysis toolkit with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Justification:** No external network calls, no code injection, no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer states the code is a standard financial data analysis library, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Justification:** All functions are standard, dependencies are typical, and no malicious patterns are observed.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All zero, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, as the code performs standard data analysis functions without external system or network access.\n\n### Final assessment:\n**The code is a legitimate, well-structured financial analysis library with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behaviors detected.** It uses standard libraries and patterns, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate (step-by-step):**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, typical for open-source financial tools)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe and suitable for deployment in financial analysis contexts.",
