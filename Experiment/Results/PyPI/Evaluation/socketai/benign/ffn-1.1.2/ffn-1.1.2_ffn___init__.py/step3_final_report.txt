  "purpose": "Package initialization: importing modules, extending pandas behavior, and setting version info.",
  "sources": "Relative imports from local modules (.core, .data), and the get function from data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Imports -> core.extend_pandas() -> setting __version__",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; standard import and extension pattern; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks: importing local modules, calling a function to extend pandas, and setting a version string. No external data, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The call to 'core.extend_pandas()' could modify pandas' global behavior but is a common pattern in data packages; without evidence of malicious behavior within that function, it is benign. The code is straightforward, transparent, and free of obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization snippet with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from the potential side effects of extending pandas globally, which is typical in data-centric libraries. Therefore, malware score: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.",
