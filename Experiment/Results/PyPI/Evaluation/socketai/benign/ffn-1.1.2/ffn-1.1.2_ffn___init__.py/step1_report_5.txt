{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package initialization, importing modules and functions, and extending pandas functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.core, .data), and the get function from data module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or potentially leaked; no network, file, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flows; code primarily imports modules and calls a function to extend pandas.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns. The extend_pandas() call is benign and commonly used in data packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules and functions, re-exports core components, and sets a version string. The function core.extend_pandas() is likely a utility to enhance pandas, not suspicious by itself. There are no network calls, no data leaks, nor unusual code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly manages module imports and extension of pandas functionality without involving untrusted data or harmful operations.",
