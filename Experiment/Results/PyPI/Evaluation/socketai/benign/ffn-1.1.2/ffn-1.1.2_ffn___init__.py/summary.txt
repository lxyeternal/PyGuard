  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization snippet with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from the potential side effects of extending pandas globally, which is typical in data-centric libraries. Therefore, malware score: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0."
