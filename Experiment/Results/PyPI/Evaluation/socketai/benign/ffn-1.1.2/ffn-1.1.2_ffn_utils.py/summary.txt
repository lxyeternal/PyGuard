  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, utility-oriented module with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor concern is pickle serialization for cache keys, which is acceptable in controlled environments. The scores assigned are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low security risk score (~0.2). The code can be considered secure for typical use cases."
