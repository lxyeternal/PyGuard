  "purpose": "Utility functions for caching, string parsing, cleaning, formatting, and scaling in data processing.",
  "sources": "Function arguments used for cache keys, input strings for cleaning and parsing, pandas DataFrame/Series for formatting.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network interactions; cache keys are generated internally.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are serialized with pickle for cache lookup; data cleaning and formatting functions process internal data.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in 'get_freq_name' ('milliseonds' instead of 'milliseconds') but no security impact.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard utility functions with in-memory caching via pickle serialization. No external data sources or sinks are present. The pickle usage is confined to cache key serialization, which is common but can be risky if cache data is exposed; here, it is internal. No obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are detected. The typo in 'get_freq_name' is minor and does not affect security. The functions are straightforward and operate on trusted inputs. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to pickle serialization considerations. The code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, utility-oriented module with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor concern is pickle serialization for cache keys, which is acceptable in controlled environments. The scores assigned are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low security risk score (~0.2). The code can be considered secure for typical use cases.",
