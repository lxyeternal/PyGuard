{
  "purpose": "The provided code contains utility functions for caching, string parsing, data cleaning, formatting, and scaling, primarily aimed at financial data processing.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read directly; all functions operate on input parameters or internal variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involve untrusted data being transmitted or used in insecure operations; no network, file I/O, or external system interaction is evident.",
  "flows": "The functions perform data transformations within memory, such as caching, string processing, and data formatting, without external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic, are present. The pickle usage is standard for serialization, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of utility functions for memoization, string parsing, data cleaning, and formatting. The _memoize function uses pickle for cache key serialization, which is common but requires caution if cache contents could be influenced by untrusted input. There are no network operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling. The functions appear straightforward and intended for data manipulation within a controlled environment. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or sabotage is detected. The only minor concern could be pickle's inherent security risk if used with untrusted data, but in this context, it is standard for caching.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It serves as utility functions for data processing without external dependencies or suspicious logic. The pickle serialization in caching is standard but should be used cautiously if input data is untrusted; however, in typical scenarios, this poses no immediate security threat.",
