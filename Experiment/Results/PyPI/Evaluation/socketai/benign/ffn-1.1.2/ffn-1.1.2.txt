The minimal security risk stems from the potential side effects of extending pandas globally, which is typical in data-centric libraries. Therefore, malware score: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0."

It is transparent, well-structured, and uses standard libraries for numerical and statistical analysis. The high confidence in this assessment is justified by the absence of suspicious patterns or external system interactions."

The only minor concern is the deprecated 'web' function, which does not pose a security threat. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured."

The only minor concern is pickle serialization for cache keys, which is acceptable in controlled environments. The scores assigned are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low security risk score (~0.2). The code can be considered secure for typical use cases."
