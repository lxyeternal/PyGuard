  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for financial data retrieval and processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor concern is the deprecated 'web' function, which does not pose a security threat. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured."
