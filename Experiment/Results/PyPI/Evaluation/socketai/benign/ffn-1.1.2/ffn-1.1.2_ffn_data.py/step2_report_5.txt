  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. It uses well-known libraries (pandas, yfinance, ffn) and performs data retrieval, cleaning, and merging.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** This is a thorough and confident evaluation. The code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard data retrieval with memoization and deprecation warnings for legacy functions.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, just a deprecated function warning.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (slightly elevated due to deprecation warning, but not malicious)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly cautious due to deprecation warning but overall benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates standard data fetching and processing, with emphasis on safe practices.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no obfuscated parts, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Very confident that the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the standard nature of data retrieval, no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No backdoors, no code injection, only deprecation warnings.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard data retrieval with no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No malicious logic, no obfuscation, just a deprecation warning.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Justification:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No. All reports agree that the code is standard, with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The only minor concern is the deprecated `web()` function issuing a warning, which is a maintenance issue, not a security concern.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the findings. The risk scores are low, reflecting minimal security concern.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The reports do not rely on assumptions; they analyze the code's behavior and dependencies.\n- **Consistency:** The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** Given the low risk and no malicious intent, I would assign a **risk score of 0.1** to reflect the deprecated function warning but overall safe code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1            |\n\nThe code appears legitimate, standard for financial data retrieval, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only concern is the deprecated `web()` function, which is a maintenance issue, not a security risk.",
