  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Finds no issues; code is standard, no obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code, which is straightforward data retrieval and processing. No suspicious patterns or malicious indicators are present.\n- **Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also finds no malicious intent; notes deprecation warning in 'web' function but considers it benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The code is similar to Report 1, with standard libraries. The only noteworthy point is the deprecated 'web' function, which warrants a warning but isn't malicious.\n- **Verdict:** The low security risk score (0.2) is justified, given the deprecation warning but no malicious activity. Malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; no malicious behavior, standard data fetching, with a deprecation warning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. The low security risk score reflects the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes that the code is mainly data retrieval, with no malicious behavior, only a deprecation warning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No suspicious activity detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others; no malicious activity, standard data access, deprecation warning noted.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Matches the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, with low security risk scores (0.1–0.2), which are justified given the deprecation warning but no malicious activity.\n- **Deprecation warning:** Noted across reports; it's a maintenance issue but not security-related.\n- **External dependencies:** Use of yfinance, pandas, and ffn are standard and widely accepted.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2) due to deprecation warning, which is reasonable but not indicative of a security threat.\n- **Confidence levels:** Appropriately high, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (considering deprecation warning, but no actual security risk)\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears secure, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and no changes are necessary.",
