{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for retrieving financial data from various sources, including Yahoo Finance and CSV files, with support for memoization, data cleaning, and merging.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function arguments such as 'tickers', 'path', 'start', 'end', 'field', 'source', and external data sources like Yahoo Finance and CSV files.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs are pandas DataFrames or Series returned by functions, which can contain sensitive financial data. No untrusted data is written externally within the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through data retrieval functions (yf, csv, web), optionally through cleaning and merging, to final DataFrame output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns observed. The code employs standard data retrieval and processing patterns with no evidence of obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard financial data retrieval using yfinance and pandas, with memoization for efficiency. It includes functions for downloading data from Yahoo Finance, CSV files, and a deprecated web function. The functions handle data cleaning, merging, and formatting, with appropriate checks and warnings. No hardcoded credentials, network connections to suspicious domains, or system manipulations are present. The use of warnings and exception handling appears standard. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation for financial data retrieval with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. It appears secure and focused solely on data fetching and processing.",
