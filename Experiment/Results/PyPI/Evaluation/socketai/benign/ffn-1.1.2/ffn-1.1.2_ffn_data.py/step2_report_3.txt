  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scoring and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code performs standard data retrieval with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors. It notes no suspicious patterns and considers the code secure.\n\n- **Findings:** The code indeed uses standard libraries (pandas, yfinance, ffn), with functions for downloading data, cleaning, merging, and memoization. No hardcoded credentials, network anomalies, or obfuscated code are observed.\n\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis. The conclusion that there's no malicious activity is justified.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is straightforward, and no issues are detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard data fetching, with a note on the deprecated 'web' function issuing a warning. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Findings:** The code employs standard libraries, with memoization, data cleaning, and a deprecation warning for 'web'. No suspicious network activity or malicious payloads are present.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, consistent with the findings. Security risk is slightly higher at 0.2, possibly due to the deprecated function warning, but this is benign.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report is reasonable. The deprecation warning is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates standard data retrieval functions, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. Notes the use of warnings.warn for deprecation.\n\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. External libraries are legitimate. Memoization is standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, security risk is 0.1, which is appropriate given the deprecated function warning but no actual security issue.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. No malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights standard data retrieval, with no signs of malicious behavior. Notes the use of warnings.warn for deprecated 'web' function.\n\n- **Findings:** No code injection, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. External dependencies are standard. No hardcoded secrets.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, security risk at 0.2, consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code appears safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing legitimate data retrieval with no malicious activity. Mentions the deprecation warning but no security concern.\n\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Uses standard libraries and practices.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, which is reasonable.\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and performs typical data retrieval tasks. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are evident.\n\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is justified. Security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minor concerns about deprecation warnings but nothing malicious.\n\n- **Potential concerns:** The only minor issue is the deprecated 'web' function issuing warnings, but this is benign and standard in legacy code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of malicious activity, code injection, or data leakage, a conservative but accurate estimate would be around **0.1** to **0.2**. The existing scores are appropriate.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to deprecated functions and warnings, but no real security risk)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is legitimate, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The existing reports' scores and conclusions are justified and reasonable.",
