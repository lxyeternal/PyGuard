{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for retrieving financial data from various sources such as Yahoo Finance, CSV files, or other providers, and processes this data into pandas DataFrames for analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters (tickers, fields, start/end dates), environment variables (if used in provider functions), and CSV files read from disk.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from providers (yf, csv) and processed into DataFrames. No direct data leakage or external system access observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Data source functions (yf, csv, provider) -> Data retrieval -> Data processing and return as DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden backdoors, or unusual data flows. Usage of warnings.warn for deprecation is standard. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic identified.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard for data fetching and processing. It uses memoization decorators to cache results, which is a typical optimization. The 'web' function warns about deprecated usage and directs to modern alternatives. The 'yf' function securely fetches data via yfinance. The 'csv' function reads data from CSV files with safety checks. No external network connections besides legitimate data downloads, no code injection, or data exfiltration routines. No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data retrieval utility with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It adheres to standard practices for fetching and processing financial data. The presence of warnings about deprecation suggests maintenance and caution but no malicious intent.",
