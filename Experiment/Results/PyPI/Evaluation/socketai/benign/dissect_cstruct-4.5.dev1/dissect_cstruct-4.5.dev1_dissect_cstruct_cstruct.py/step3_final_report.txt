{
  "purpose": "This code provides a framework for defining, resolving, and converting C-like data structures in Python, primarily for binary parsing and analysis. It does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Type definitions, external structure definitions loaded via loadfile, and data streams read via read().",
  "sinks": "Data parsing functions that process external data streams and definitions; no network or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "External definitions and data streams are parsed into internal type representations; no suspicious data flow or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Uses standard dynamic class creation and type resolution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured library for handling C-like structures in Python. It performs type registration, resolution, and parsing with safeguards like recursion limits. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The external data handling introduces minimal risk, typical for parsers, but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility for binary data structure management. No malware or malicious behavior is present. The slight security risk score of 0.2 reflects potential misuse if malicious definitions are loaded, but this is a common consideration for such tools and does not imply malicious activity.",
