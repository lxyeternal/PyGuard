  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe expression tokenizer and parser with no malicious or obfuscated elements. External dependencies are typical and do not pose direct security threats. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this analysis. The high risk score in some reports (e.g., 0.95) is unjustified and should be lowered to approximately 0.1-0.2."
