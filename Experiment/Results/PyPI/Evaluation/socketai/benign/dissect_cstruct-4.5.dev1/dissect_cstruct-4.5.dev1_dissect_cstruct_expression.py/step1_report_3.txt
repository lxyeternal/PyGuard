{
  "purpose": "The code provides a tokenizer and parser for evaluating expressions, likely for use in a larger codebase that deals with parsing and evaluating expressions in C-like syntax.",
  "sources": "Input expression string passed to the Expression class constructor; tokens generated during tokenization.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include external sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system calls; it primarily processes and evaluates expressions internally.",
  "flows": "Input expression → Tokenizer generates tokens → Expression parser processes tokens → Evaluates expression to produce a result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The code primarily handles expression parsing and evaluation, with no external system interaction or data exfiltration. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or external dependencies that could hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard tokenization and expression parsing for mathematical and logical expressions, with handling for operators, precedence, and special tokens. It includes basic error handling for malformed expressions. No external network, file, or system interactions are present that could indicate malicious behavior. The focus is on internal expression evaluation, which appears legitimate and typical for such use cases.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard expression tokenizer and parser with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It strictly processes input expressions and evaluates them internally, with no evidence of malicious data leakage, backdoors, or malicious side effects.",
