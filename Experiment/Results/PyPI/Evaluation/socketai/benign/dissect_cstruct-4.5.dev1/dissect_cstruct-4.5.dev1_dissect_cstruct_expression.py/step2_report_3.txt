  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard expression tokenizer and parser, with no malicious signals.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.95\n- **Assessment:** The high risk score seems unjustified given the detailed analysis indicating no malicious intent. The code performs standard tokenization and parsing, with proper error handling and no obfuscation or malicious behavior. The malware score should be 0, and the risk score should be closer to 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0\n- **Assessment:** The scores align well with the analysis. No issues here.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard expression parser with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated risk score (0.1) perhaps due to external dependencies ('cstruct'), but the code itself appears safe. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, with focus on external 'cstruct' data as a potential concern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The slightly higher risk score reflects the external dependency concern, but the code logic itself remains safe. Malware remains 0, which is correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Standard expression evaluation code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The risk score is slightly elevated but justified given external data dependencies, not malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk scores:** The scores vary from 0.0 to 0.2, generally justified. The first report's high risk score (0.95) is unreasonable given the detailed analysis; it should be lowered to align with the others.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The **malware** score should remain **0** across all reports.\n- The **obfuscated** score should be **0**.\n- The **security risk** scores should be consistent and not excessively high. For the first report, reduce from 0.95 to around 0.1 or 0.2.\n- The overall **malware**, **obfuscated**, and **risk** scores for this code should be:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** approximately 0.1, considering external dependencies but no malicious code.\n\n**In summary:**\n- The code is a standard, safe expression parser and tokenizer.\n- No malware or obfuscation present.\n- Slight external dependency concerns do not elevate the security risk significantly.\n- The original high risk score in Report 1 is unjustified and should be lowered accordingly.",
