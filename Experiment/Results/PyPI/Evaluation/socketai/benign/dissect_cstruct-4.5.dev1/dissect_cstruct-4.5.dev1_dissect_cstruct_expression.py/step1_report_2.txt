{
  "purpose": "The code implements a tokenizer and parser for evaluating expressions, primarily for use in a dissection or reverse engineering context, to analyze binary data structures and calculations.",
  "sources": "Expression string input from the constructor, internal methods reading tokens and characters, context dictionary for variable substitution.",
  "sinks": "Evaluation functions performing arithmetic, tokenization, and parsing; no explicit data sinks like network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Input expression → tokenization → parsing with operator precedence and variable/context substitution → evaluation of expression results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The code performs standard expression parsing and evaluation, with no external system calls or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements a tokenizer and expression evaluator for arithmetic expressions, supporting unary/binary operators, constants, and variable references. Tokenization correctly handles numeric formats, operators, and identifiers. The parser uses a shunting-yard algorithm to manage operator precedence and evaluates the expression. No evidence of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration routines. The code appears to be a safe, standard implementation for expression parsing within a dissection tool context.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard expression tokenizer and evaluator with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It serves its purpose for parsing and computing expressions in a dissection context, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
