{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes for tokenizing and parsing mathematical expressions, primarily used for evaluating expressions in a structured context, such as within a larger codebase that interprets or compiles definitions.",
  "sources": "Input expression string provided during instantiation of the Expression class.",
  "sinks": "Evaluation and tokenization processes that convert string expressions into numerical results, with no evident external data sinks or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Expression string → Tokenizer generates tokens → Parser converts tokens into evaluated result; no external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs detected. The code relies solely on standard libraries and dissects specific expression syntax. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard tokenization and expression parsing with operator precedence, handling numeric, identifier, and operator tokens. The tokenizer correctly recognizes operators, numbers (including hex, binary, octal), and identifiers, raising errors for invalid notation. The parser uses a variant of the shunting-yard algorithm, supporting unary and binary operators, parentheses, and context-dependent variables. It raises errors on malformed expressions such as unmatched parentheses, invalid operator sequences, or empty parentheses. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The use of only standard and dissect libraries minimizes external risk. Overall, the code appears safe, with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard expression tokenizer and parser, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs expected parsing tasks securely and correctly, with appropriate error handling. No malicious signals or security risks are identified.",
