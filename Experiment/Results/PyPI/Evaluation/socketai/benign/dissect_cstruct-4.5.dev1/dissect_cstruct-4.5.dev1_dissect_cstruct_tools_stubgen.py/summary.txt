  "conclusion": "The core security risk stems from the use of dynamic import and execution of arbitrary code via importlib's spec_from_file_location and exec_module. While the code does not contain malicious payloads itself, the method used is highly risky and can lead to malware if untrusted files are processed. The malware score should be adjusted upward to approximately 0.7 to accurately reflect this risk. Obfuscation is not detected. The overall security risk is high, around 0.75, due to the potential for malicious code execution during module import."
