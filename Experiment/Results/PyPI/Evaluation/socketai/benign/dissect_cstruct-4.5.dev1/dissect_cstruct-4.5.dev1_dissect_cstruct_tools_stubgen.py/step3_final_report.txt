  "purpose": "Analyze the code for dynamic module loading via importlib, which executes arbitrary code from specified files, posing security risks.",
  "sources": "The function load_module uses spec_from_file_location and exec_module to load and execute code from user-specified paths.",
  "sinks": "exec_module executes code in the loaded module, which can lead to malicious code execution if the input files are compromised.",
  "flows": "The code reads files via the specified path, loads modules with spec_from_file_location, and executes code with exec_module, leading to potential malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.util.spec_from_file_location and exec_module without validation or sandboxing; no input validation or security checks before execution.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically loads modules from arbitrary file paths using importlib's spec_from_file_location and exec_module, which execute the code in those files. This pattern is inherently risky if the files are untrusted, as malicious payloads could run during import. The code itself does not contain malicious payloads, but the method of execution is dangerous. Scores assigned in the reports vary; the malware score should be increased to reflect the high risk of executing untrusted code. Obfuscation is not present. Overall, the main security concern is the potential for malicious code execution during dynamic import, which can lead to malware infection if files are compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The core security risk stems from the use of dynamic import and execution of arbitrary code via importlib's spec_from_file_location and exec_module. While the code does not contain malicious payloads itself, the method used is highly risky and can lead to malware if untrusted files are processed. The malware score should be adjusted upward to approximately 0.7 to accurately reflect this risk. Obfuscation is not detected. The overall security risk is high, around 0.75, due to the potential for malicious code execution during module import.",
