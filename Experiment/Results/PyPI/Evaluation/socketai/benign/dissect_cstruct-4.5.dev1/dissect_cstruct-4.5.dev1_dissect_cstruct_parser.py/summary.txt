  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured parser with no evidence of malicious payloads or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the evaluation of expressions from untrusted input, which could be exploited if 'Expression' is unsafe. Overall, it appears safe but warrants caution regarding expression evaluation on untrusted data."
