  "purpose": "Parser for C-like structure definitions, enums, typedefs, constants, using regex tokenization and expression evaluation.",
  "sources": "Input data strings containing definitions, constants, enums, and lookup expressions.",
  "sinks": "Evaluation of string literals via ast.literal_eval and Expression.evaluate(), which could execute code if inputs are malicious and Expression is unsafe.",
  "flows": "Source data -> regex tokenization -> literal or expression evaluation -> data structures and constants.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'Expression.evaluate()' on untrusted input; no explicit validation or sandboxing shown.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward parser for structured definitions, utilizing regex and token management. 'ast.literal_eval' is safe for literals, but 'Expression.evaluate()' could pose a security risk if it executes arbitrary code. No network, file, or system modifications are present. The parser handles constants, enums, structs, and lookups, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads detected. The main concern is evaluation of untrusted expressions, which could be exploited if 'Expression' is compromised. Scores of malware 0 and moderate security risk (~0.2-0.35) are justified based on potential evaluation vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured parser with no evidence of malicious payloads or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the evaluation of expressions from untrusted input, which could be exploited if 'Expression' is unsafe. Overall, it appears safe but warrants caution regarding expression evaluation on untrusted data.",
