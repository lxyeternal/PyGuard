  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - No input/output, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly state that the code is purely structural and standard for defining custom exceptions.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated: 0`\n     - `malware: 0`\n     - `securityRisk: 0`\n     - `confidence: 1`\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores align well with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is justified.\n   - Since there's no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerability, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that there is no malware activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's content.\n   - They recognize that the code is purely for defining exception classes.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analyses.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary and Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities present.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code.",
