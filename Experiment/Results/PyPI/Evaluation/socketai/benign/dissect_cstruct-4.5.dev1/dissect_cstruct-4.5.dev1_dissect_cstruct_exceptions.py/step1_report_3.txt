  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a larger application.",
  "sources": "None; no data input or external data reading is present.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output operations are performed.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists between sources and sinks, as this code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard class inheritance for custom exceptions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class declarations inheriting from a base Error class. These classes are intended for use as custom exception types in an application. No input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive functions are present. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It is purely structural and does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
