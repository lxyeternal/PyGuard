  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error types in a program.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only class definitions with inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard class inheritance for custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of several custom exception classes inheriting from Error, which itself inherits from Exception. All classes are simple pass-through classes without additional logic, attributes, or dynamic behavior. No input reading, no data transmission, no code injection, or suspicious constructs are present. The structure aligns with standard Python practice for defining custom exceptions, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code purely defines custom exception classes for error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The code appears legitimate and safe.",
