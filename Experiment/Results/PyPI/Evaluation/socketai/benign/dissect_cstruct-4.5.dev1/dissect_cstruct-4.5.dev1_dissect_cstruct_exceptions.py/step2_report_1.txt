  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its context, and the scoring.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe provided code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from a base Error class, which itself inherits from Python's Exception. All classes are simple pass-through classes with no additional logic, attributes, or dynamic behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code matches the description: only class definitions, no data input/output, no dynamic code, no suspicious constructs.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n- The purpose is to define custom exceptions for error handling.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is straightforward, safe, and standard for error handling in Python applications.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Reports and Scores:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Analysis:** Correctly states no malicious or obfuscated code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, confirms no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Analysis:** Same as above, straightforward class definitions, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Analysis:** Consistent with previous, no anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Analysis:** Same as others, standard exception class hierarchy.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no external interactions, the risk score should be 0 or very close to it.\n\n**Note on Risk Score:**  \nWhile some reports assign 0, if we consider the potential for misclassification, a risk score of 0.1 might be more appropriate to indicate negligible but non-zero residual risk, but given the analysis, 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be **0** for all reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0              | 0                 | 0            | No malicious or obfuscated code; purely class definitions. |\n| 2       | 0              | 0                 | 0            | Same reasoning. |\n| 3       | 0              | 0                 | 0            | No anomalies, straightforward class hierarchy. |\n| 4       | 0              | 0                 | 0            | No suspicious behavior detected. |\n| 5       | 0              | 0                 | 0            | Standard exception classes, no security issues. |\n\n**Overall, I agree with the existing scores.**",
