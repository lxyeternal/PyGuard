  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from a base Error class, which itself inherits from Exception. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and does not contain any obfuscation or malicious constructs.  \n   **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, standard, and lacks malicious intent. They correctly identify the code as purely defining exception classes without any suspicious logic. There are no logical flaws or misconceptions in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.  \n   - **Confidence:** All reports have a confidence of 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.  \n   \n   The scores seem appropriate and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no dynamic behavior, no input/output, and no suspicious constructs, there is no reason to assign a high risk score. The risk score should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make any unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as harmless.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   The scores are consistent and appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions. No security concerns are present.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the content of the reports.",
