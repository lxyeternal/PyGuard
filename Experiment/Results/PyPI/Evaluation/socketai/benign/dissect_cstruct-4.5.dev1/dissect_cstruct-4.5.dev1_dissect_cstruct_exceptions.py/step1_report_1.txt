  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a larger Python application",
  "sources": "No input data reading, only class definitions",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external interactions",
  "flows": "No data flows; only class inheritance structures",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class inheritance for exceptions",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from the base Error class, which itself inherits from Exception. These classes are used for specific error handling scenarios, such as parsing errors and dereference errors. There are no input reading, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. No obfuscated code, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The structure is simple and clear, serving only to establish custom exception types.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely defining custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard practice for organized error handling in Python applications.",
