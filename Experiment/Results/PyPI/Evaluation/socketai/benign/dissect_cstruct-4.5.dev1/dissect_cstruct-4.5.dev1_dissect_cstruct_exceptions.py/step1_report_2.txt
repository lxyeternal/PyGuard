  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs, no untrusted data processing, no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains class definitions for exceptions; no suspicious or malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base Error class, which itself inherits from Exception. The class hierarchy appears standard for custom error handling. There are no data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is present. The code is straightforward and typical for error management modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard exception class hierarchy with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It serves to organize error handling in a larger system and contains no malware or security risks.",
