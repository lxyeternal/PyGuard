  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a larger application or module.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reads; only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; exception classes are static definitions with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from a base Error class, which itself inherits from Python's Exception. The classes are named to indicate specific error types related to parsing, resolving, dereferencing, array sizing, and tokenization. There are no dynamic operations, data handling, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to serve as a set of custom exception definitions for use elsewhere, with no embedded malicious logic or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only standard class definitions for custom exceptions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign component for error handling.",
