  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the original code.\n\n1. **Report 1:**\n   - **Summary:** The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from `Error`, which itself inherits from `Exception`. No input/output, data processing, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - **Assessment:** The report accurately describes the code as straightforward class definitions for error handling, with no malicious or security issues.\n   - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - **Conclusion:** The report's assessment and scoring are reasonable.\n\n2. **Report 2:**\n   - **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the absence of data input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - **Assessment:** Correct; the code is purely class definitions.\n   - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n3. **Report 3:**\n   - **Summary:** Same as above; standard class inheritance for custom exceptions, no suspicious activity.\n   - **Assessment:** Accurate.\n   - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Suitable.\n   - **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n4. **Report 4:**\n   - **Summary:** Defines multiple exception classes inheriting from `Error`. No input/output or dynamic behavior.\n   - **Assessment:** Correct.\n   - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Correct.\n   - **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n5. **Report 5:**\n   - **Summary:** Same as previous; standard exception class definitions.\n   - **Assessment:** Accurate.\n   - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Reasonable.\n   - **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None. All reports correctly identify the code as benign class definitions.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are zero, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Security Risks:** None evident.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\nGiven the consistency across reports and the straightforward nature of the code, I agree with the current scores. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
