  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of custom exception classes for error handling in Python.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Error and Exception, no input/output or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Class inheritance hierarchy; no data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from a base Error class. There are no input/output operations, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs. The classes are simple pass-throughs with no attributes or methods. All reports correctly identify the benign, standard nature of the code. No malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns. All reports and scores are accurate; no adjustments needed.",
