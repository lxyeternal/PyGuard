{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for hexdumping, structure dumping, data packing/unpacking, and byte order swapping, primarily for debugging and data serialization in cybersecurity or reverse engineering contexts.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input bytes, structure instances, and structure class fields.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include print statements and string returns; no evidence of data being sent over networks, written to files, or used in system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input bytes or structures to hexdump or dump output, with optional colorized formatting, and byte order conversions. No external or untrusted data sources are directly invoked in a suspicious manner.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. The code does not perform network operations, system modifications, or contain obfuscated logic. The color and dumping functions are standard for debugging tools.",
  "analysis": "The script offers utility functions for visualizing binary data, handling endianness, and struct serialization, common in debugging or reverse engineering workflows. All functions perform standard operations without any network activity, file writing, or covert channels. There are no signs of malicious intent such as code injection, data exfiltration, or system sabotage. The functions do not contain hidden code or obfuscation patterns; their structure is straightforward. The presence of colorized output and hex dumping is consistent with diagnostic tools, and no suspicious code flows are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility library designed for debugging, data serialization, and visualization purposes. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware within the provided code. It is safe for use in security-related workflows.",
