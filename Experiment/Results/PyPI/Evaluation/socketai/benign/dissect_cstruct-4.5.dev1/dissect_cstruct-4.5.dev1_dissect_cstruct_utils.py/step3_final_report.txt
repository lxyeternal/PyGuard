{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for hexdumping, structure dumping, data serialization, and visualization, primarily for debugging and binary data analysis.",
  "sources": "Data passed explicitly via function parameters; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Output to console via print statements or returned as strings; no external communication or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through formatting functions to output functions; no external or network flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard debugging and data visualization utilities, including hexdump, structure dump, packing/unpacking integers, and byte order swapping. No network, file, or system modification operations are present. The functions are straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility library for binary data inspection and serialization, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.",
