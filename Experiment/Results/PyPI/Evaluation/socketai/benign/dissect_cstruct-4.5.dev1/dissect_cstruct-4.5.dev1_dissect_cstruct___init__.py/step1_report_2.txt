{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules and functions from the 'dissect.cstruct' package, likely for parsing, manipulating, and analyzing structured binary data.",
  "sources": "The code reads data through imported modules and functions, but does not explicitly perform input operations within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not perform data output, network communication, or data storage operations.",
  "flows": "There are no active data flows in this code snippet; it only defines imports and __all__ exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code mainly consists of imports and an __all__ list, with no runtime logic or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules and functions from the 'dissect.cstruct' library, which is used for parsing and handling structured binary data. The __all__ list exports these imported items for external use. There are no input reading, data processing, or network operations within this snippet. The code appears to be part of a library or module setup rather than an executable script. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of imports and exports from a structured binary data handling library. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions as a module setup with no active data flows or external inputs/outputs.",
