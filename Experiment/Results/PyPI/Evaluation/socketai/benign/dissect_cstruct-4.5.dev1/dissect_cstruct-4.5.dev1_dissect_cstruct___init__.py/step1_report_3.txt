{
  "purpose": "This code provides import statements and exports for various components of the dissect.cstruct library, which appears to be used for parsing and handling binary data structures.",
  "sources": "Import statements from dissect.cstruct modules and the __all__ list defining exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or actions, as the code only performs imports and module exports.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or operations performed; the code solely imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports various classes, functions, and exceptions from the dissect.cstruct package, and defines the __all__ list for exports. There are no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing observed. The structure is typical for a Python module that re-exports symbols for easier access. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module setup that exports components of the dissect.cstruct library. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks. It simply manages imports and exports.",
