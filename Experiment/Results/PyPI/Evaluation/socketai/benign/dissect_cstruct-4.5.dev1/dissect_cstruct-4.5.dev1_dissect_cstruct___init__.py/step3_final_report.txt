{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports various components from the dissect.cstruct library and re-exports them via the __all__ list, acting as an interface or aggregation layer.",
  "sources": "Import statements from dissect.cstruct modules, no external data input or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; no network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static import and export only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected; straightforward import/export structure.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ list defining exported symbols. It does not process data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code functions as a benign interface module for the dissect.cstruct library, with no vulnerabilities or security risks evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module setup with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It simply re-exports components from a known open-source library, and the analysis confirms its safety.",
