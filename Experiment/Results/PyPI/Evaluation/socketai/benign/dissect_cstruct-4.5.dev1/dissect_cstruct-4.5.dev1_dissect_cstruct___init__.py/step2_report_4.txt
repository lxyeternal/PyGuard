  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code imports from `dissect.cstruct`.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows are present.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or obfuscated code; purely import statements.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is benign with high confidence.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is just imports and exports.  \n- No suspicious activity or anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Again, notes only import/export, no malicious behavior.  \n- No anomalies or data flows.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Same pattern: import/export only, no runtime logic or data handling.  \n- No suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Consistent with previous assessments: only imports, no dynamic code, no data processing, no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code content:** The code is purely a module that imports various components from the `dissect.cstruct` library and re-exports them via `__all__`.  \n- **Behavior:** No data processing, no network activity, no file I/O, no dynamic execution, no obfuscation.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected; scores of 0 are justified.  \n- **Security risk:** None evident; the code functions as a benign interface layer.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The current scores are consistent and reasonable given the code's nature.  \n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, benign module setup with no security concerns.",
