  "purpose": "Implement a bit buffer for reading and writing bit fields from a binary stream, supporting specified endianness.",
  "sources": "The stream input (stream: BinaryIO) and the field_type parameter in read/write methods.",
  "sinks": "The stream's _write method called during flush, potentially writing data to external storage or network.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from the stream in _read calls, stored in the buffer, and then written back to the stream via _write during flush.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code performs standard bit manipulation and stream operations. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present. The use of type annotations with external types does not introduce risk.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a typical bit buffer with methods for reading, writing, flushing, and resetting internal buffers. It uses standard Python features, type hints, and straightforward bitwise operations. The flow involves reading bytes from a stream, converting to integers based on endianness, manipulating bits, and writing back to the stream. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is evident. The stream's _write method could be a sink, but it's a standard pattern for binary data handling. Overall, the code appears to be a normal utility for binary stream processing with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a bit buffer for reading and writing binary data. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are detected. It functions as intended for binary stream processing without any suspicious or harmful activities.",
