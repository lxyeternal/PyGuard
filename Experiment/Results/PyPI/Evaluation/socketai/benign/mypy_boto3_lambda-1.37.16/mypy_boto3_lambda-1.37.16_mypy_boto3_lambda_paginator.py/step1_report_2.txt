{
  "purpose": "Define typed paginator classes for AWS Lambda service in boto3, with type annotations for open-source SDK support.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class methods accessing pagination functionality.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no use of untrusted input, environment variables, or network calls within this code.",
  "flows": "The code provides type annotations for paginator methods, primarily for static type checking and documentation. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is predominantly boilerplate with extensive use of type annotations, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or dynamic code execution, no unusual patterns or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for AWS Lambda with proper type annotations and documentation links. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, and leverages Python's typing system to facilitate static analysis. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as network communications, file modifications, or credential handling, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and intended solely for type annotations and documentation purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
