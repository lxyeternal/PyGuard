  "purpose": "Define typed paginator classes for AWS Lambda service client, enabling type-safe pagination over various Lambda list operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements: sys, typing, botocore.paginate, local type_defs module. Type annotations within class methods and conditional type imports.",
  "sinks": "Method 'paginate' which accepts arbitrary keyword arguments and returns a PageIterator; no other data sinks or untrusted data sources identified.",
  "flows": "Input source: '**kwargs' in 'paginate' methods, flows to 'PageIterator' return type; no external untrusted data used or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns. Use of type annotations and import structure is standard for type safety. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of paginator classes for AWS Lambda, each extending a base 'Paginator' class with specific response types. The 'paginate' methods are properly typed, accepting arbitrary keyword arguments with defined types, and returning 'PageIterator' objects. Conditional imports for 'Unpack' ensure compatibility with different Python versions. No indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security flaws. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured, type-annotated SDK extension for safer code completion and static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-specific set of class definitions for AWS SDK pagination with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It enhances type safety and clarity but does not perform any suspicious or harmful operations.",
