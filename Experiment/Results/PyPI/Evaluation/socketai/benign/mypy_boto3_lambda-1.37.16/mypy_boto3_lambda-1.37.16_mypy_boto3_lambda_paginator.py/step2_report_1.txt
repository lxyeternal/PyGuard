  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided details.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as providing type annotations and paginator classes for AWS Lambda boto3 client, sourced from standard modules and local type_defs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that 'paginate' methods use kwargs for pagination requests, with no untrusted data or external side effects.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Appropriately identifies the code as standard, auto-generated, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is benign, with high confidence (0.95), no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code defines typed paginator classes for AWS Lambda, importing from sys, typing, botocore, and local type_defs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or external calls; the code is purely type annotations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Appropriately notes boilerplate nature, standard patterns, and absence of malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurately describes the code as standard and safe, with full confidence (1.0).\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as defining paginator classes with type annotations, using standard imports and conditional Unpack import.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external effects; kwargs are used solely for pagination.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Appropriately notes no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, with full confidence (1).\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code provides type annotations and paginator classes for boto3 Lambda SDK.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data flows; method signatures are purely type annotations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Appropriately notes the absence of malicious patterns, dynamic code, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly concludes the code is benign, with high confidence (1).\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code defines paginator classes with type annotations, with proper imports and conditional 'Unpack'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external effects; 'paginate' methods are type-annotated and safe.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation; the code is standard for boto3 stubs.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Properly states the code is safe, with full confidence (1.0).\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description; no issues or anomalies.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated scores:** All reports correctly assign 0 malware and 0 obfuscated.\n- **Risk scores:** All are appropriately low (0 or very close), given the benign nature.\n- **Logical consistency:** The reports are consistent, detailed, and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — no obfuscation or hidden code.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, as the code is purely type annotations and interface definitions for boto3 paginators, with no external or dangerous operations.\n\n**Rationale:** The code is standard, auto-generated, and designed solely for static type safety. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the code is safe. The overall assessment aligns with the evidence.",
