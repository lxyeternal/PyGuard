  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of auto-generated, type-annotated paginator classes for AWS Lambda in boto3.\n- No dynamic code, network operations, or data leaks are present.\n- The code uses standard Python idioms, conditional imports for compatibility, and type annotations.\n- The 'paginate' methods accept kwargs typed with specific request types, which are then passed to the underlying Paginator class.\n- The overall structure is consistent and aligns with typical boto3-stubs patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues in the code:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are evident. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security flaws.\n- **Malicious behavior:** The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct, with proper use of type annotations, conditional imports, and class inheritance.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n\n- No logical or syntactical errors are observed.\n- The use of `Unpack` with conditional import is standard for Python version compatibility.\n- The classes and methods follow a consistent pattern, with no anomalies.\n\n### Score assessments:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5. Given the absence of any security issues, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n\n- Since the code is purely for type annotations and interface definitions, with no dynamic or security-sensitive operations, a risk score of **0** is appropriate.\n- Assigning higher scores (e.g., 0.5 or above) would suggest potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent, which is not supported here.\n\n### Consistency with report claims:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, boilerplate, and free of malicious behavior.\n- The detailed reasoning matches the code's content, confirming no hidden issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Category        | Score |\n|-----------------|---------|\n| Malware         | 0       |\n| Obfuscated      | 0       |\n| Risk            | 0       |\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- The code is a typical, auto-generated set of boto3 stubs for pagination.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior detected.\n- The code's purpose is purely to facilitate static type checking and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and free of security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** All scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
