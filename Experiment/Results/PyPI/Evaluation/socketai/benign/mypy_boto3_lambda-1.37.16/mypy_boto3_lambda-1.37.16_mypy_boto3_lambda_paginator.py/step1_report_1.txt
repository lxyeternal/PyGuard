  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginator classes for AWS Lambda boto3 client, enabling type-checked pagination over Lambda resources.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore.paginate, local type_defs module, and sys.version_info for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods are the primary sink points where untrusted parameters (kwargs) are used, but they are used solely for pagination requests.",
  "flows": "From 'paginate' method parameters (kwargs) through the Unpack type into request types, used in Paginator<Page> to iterate over responses.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; the code uses standard class inheritance, type annotations, and conditional imports. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple paginator classes for AWS Lambda, each inheriting from a generic Paginator with specific response types. The 'paginate' methods accept kwargs with type annotations corresponding to request types, then pass these to the underlying Paginator implementation. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks are present. The use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard for compatibility. The structure is typical for auto-generated boto3 stubs, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, type-annotated set of paginator classes for AWS Lambda SDK, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be auto-generated for type safety and developer convenience.",
