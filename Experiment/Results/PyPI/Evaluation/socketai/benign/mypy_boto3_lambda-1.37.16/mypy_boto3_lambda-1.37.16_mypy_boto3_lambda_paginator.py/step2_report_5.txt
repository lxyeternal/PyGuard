  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code provides type annotations and paginator classes for AWS Lambda, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The detailed explanation of imports, class inheritance, and method signatures aligns with the code structure. The confidence level is high (0.95), and no anomalies or risks are noted.\n\n- **Score justification:** The malware score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature. The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with straightforward, auto-generated stub code. The overall risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report emphasizes that the code is boilerplate, mainly for static type checking, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. It correctly notes the absence of external calls, secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Score justification:** The malware score remains 0, as there's no malicious activity. Obfuscated is 0, as the code is clear and standard. The risk score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, it highlights the code's purpose as defining type annotations and paginator classes, with no suspicious logic. The analysis confirms the absence of dynamic code, external communication, or data leaks.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and risk at 0, all consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report describes the code as a set of class definitions for paginators, with proper type annotations and no malicious patterns. It correctly states that the code is purely interface-oriented, serving as type hints.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and overall risk is 0, aligning with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report again confirms that the code is a benign set of class definitions for AWS Lambda paginators, with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent. It notes the use of conditional imports and type annotations as standard practices.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score remains 0, obfuscated at 0, and risk at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is consistent across all reports; it is a standard set of boto3 stub classes for pagination with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign malware score 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscation:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, auto-generated nature.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, justified by the benign, interface-only code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or supply chain concern)\n\nThis code appears to be a typical, well-structured set of type annotations and paginator class definitions for AWS Lambda SDK support, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
