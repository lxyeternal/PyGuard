  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is standard, auto-generated, and uses typical patterns for boto3 stubs. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The 'malware' score of 0 aligns with this.\n\n- **Potential issues:** None. The code is purely type annotations and class definitions for paginators.\n\n- **Score justification:** Given the lack of any suspicious behavior, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. The risk score of 0 also makes sense.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is boilerplate, with proper type annotations, no dynamic code, or malicious patterns. The confidence is high, and no anomalies are found.\n\n- **Score justification:** The malware score of 0 is justified. No security risks or obfuscation are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is straightforward, defining paginator classes with type annotations. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score remains 0, consistent with the analysis. The confidence is high, and no anomalies are observed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The same pattern repeats—type annotations, paginator classes, no suspicious logic. The code serves as static type hints for AWS SDK.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate. No risks or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports. The code is standard, auto-generated, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score remains 0, aligned with the absence of suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code being purely type annotations and class definitions for SDK pagination.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Not explicitly provided, but all reports indicate no obfuscation. I would assign an obfuscated score of 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity or code behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0** — No security risk, no data leaks, no dynamic or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and paginator class definitions for AWS Lambda SDK, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be an auto-generated, static typing aid for developers.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further detailed reasoning or specific points addressed.",
