{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for AWS Lambda boto3 client, facilitating static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class methods accepting kwargs for pagination requests.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external network calls, or data leaks; methods only process internal parameters.",
  "flows": "Kwargs passed to 'paginate' methods are used internally for pagination; no external data flow or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; standard boilerplate for boto3 stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of auto-generated, type-annotated paginator classes for AWS Lambda SDK, using conditional imports for compatibility, with no dynamic code, network operations, or security-sensitive logic. It strictly provides static type hints and interface definitions, with 'paginate' methods accepting specific request types and returning page iterators. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and solely intended for static type safety. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, auto-generated SDK support module.",
