{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginators for AWS Lambda client using boto3, with type safety for open-source contributions and type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions. Type annotations for various paginator classes and their methods.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; standard paginator methods with type annotations, no untrusted data handling, or external calls executed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly class definitions, method signatures, and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.version_info for conditional import, which is standard; no suspicious dynamic code or obfuscation detected. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors present. The code appears to be a straightforward typing and interface definition for boto3 paginators.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple paginator classes inheriting from Paginator, with method signatures annotated for pagination. All class methods are type annotated and contain docstrings referencing external documentation. No execution of dynamic code, network calls, or handling of untrusted data is present. The structure is consistent and matches the purpose of providing type hints for AWS SDK paginators. No anomalies or suspicious patterns such as obfuscation, hidden behavior, or malicious imports are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations for boto3 Lambda paginators. No malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain sabotage are detected. It is a benign, purely interface-oriented module with no signs of malware.",
