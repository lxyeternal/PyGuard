{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and paginators for AWS Lambda service client to facilitate static type checking and code assistance.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; class methods using **kwargs for paginator configurations.",
  "sinks": "Methods like paginate accept **kwargs which are unpacked as type-defined request parameters; no untrusted data sources or output sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input source: method arguments (**kwargs). No data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks. Paginator classes use these kwargs to generate page iterators.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code mainly defines type-annotated classes with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up paginator classes for AWS Lambda using type annotations. It imports necessary modules, defines paginator subclasses with type-annotated paginate methods, and conditionally imports Unpack for type hinting based on Python version. No suspicious logic, external network access, or data leaks are evident. The structure adheres to standard boto3-stubs patterns, with no indications of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and paginator class definitions for AWS Lambda. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It serves as a static typing aid without any malicious or risky functionality.",
