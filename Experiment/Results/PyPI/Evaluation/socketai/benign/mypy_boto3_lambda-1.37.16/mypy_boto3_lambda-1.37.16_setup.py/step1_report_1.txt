{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used to configure and install the Python package 'mypy-boto3-lambda', providing metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and imports standard modules for setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; the script only reads static files and sets package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard setup procedures, and no hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, reads a markdown file for description, and calls setuptools.setup() with static parameters. All data appears to be hardcoded or read from known safe files. There is no indication of dynamic or suspicious behaviors, such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The install_requires line uses environment-specific conditionals correctly, and the overall structure aligns with typical Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious elements identified. It poses no security risk.",
