  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-lambda' which provides type annotations for boto3 Lambda services.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and static package metadata such as package name, version, authors, URLs, classifiers, keywords, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; the code only handles static data and configuration for package setup.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; data read from file and constants used for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs standard setup procedures with no unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path from pathlib for reading a markdown file for long description, and uses setuptools for package setup. It reads the README.md file content securely. All metadata such as package info, URLs, dependencies, and classifiers are static and do not involve user input or untrusted sources. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or sensitive data handling is present. The dependencies and URLs are standard and point to reputable sources. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
