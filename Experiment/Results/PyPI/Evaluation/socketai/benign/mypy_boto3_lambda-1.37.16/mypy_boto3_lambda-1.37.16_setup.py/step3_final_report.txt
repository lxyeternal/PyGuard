  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description; static metadata and package data definitions within setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or inputs; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Reads local README.md file -> passes static parameters to setup() -> package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and uses standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted inputs. It reads a local file and defines static metadata, dependencies, and package data. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, which aligns with the code's nature. The overall assessment confirms the script is safe and standard, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard packaging code with no malicious or suspicious elements. All signals indicate a safe, static configuration. The malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are correctly set to 0, reflecting the code's harmless nature.",
