{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging the 'mypy-boto3-lambda' Python library, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the script file itself (__file__), reads the README.md file for long description, and defines static configuration data for setup().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; all data sources are static or derived from local files without user input.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks; setup parameters are static or file-based with no user interaction or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic present. The script follows typical Python packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script used for packaging a Python project. It imports required modules, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with static metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no network activity are present. The dependencies are well-defined, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
