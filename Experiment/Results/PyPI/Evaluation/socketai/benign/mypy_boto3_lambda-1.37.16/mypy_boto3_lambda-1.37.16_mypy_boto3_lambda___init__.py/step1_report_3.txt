{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface module for AWS Lambda service, providing importable classes and objects to interact with AWS Lambda through boto3 stubs, including waiters, paginators, and a client wrapper.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter); the initial comment block with documentation and usage examples.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code primarily consists of class imports and simple variable assignments, with no network, file, or environment variable interactions.",
  "flows": "Initialization of client and waiters/paginators flows from imported classes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures; documentation and code are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly a module that imports and re-exports classes and objects for easier access. It contains a detailed usage docstring, but no dynamic code execution, no data handling, and no network activity. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed. It appears to be a standard interface wrapper for AWS Lambda boto3 stubs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious interface module for AWS Lambda SDK. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues are present.",
