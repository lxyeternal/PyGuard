{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an interface module for AWS Lambda service, providing imports, type annotations, and exposing classes and functions for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads static import statements, module attributes, and docstrings for documentation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is present; primarily static imports and definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a detailed docstring with example usage, but no suspicious or unusual code segments, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily composed of import statements, type aliasing, and documentation. It does not process input, execute dynamic code, or perform any network or file operations. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is observed. The only notable element is a large documentation block which is for illustrative purposes and does not affect execution. All imported modules and classes are from local modules, with no external data sources or sinks. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a Python interface module.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard, benign interface module for AWS Lambda SDK, with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe for use and does not pose any supply chain threats.",
