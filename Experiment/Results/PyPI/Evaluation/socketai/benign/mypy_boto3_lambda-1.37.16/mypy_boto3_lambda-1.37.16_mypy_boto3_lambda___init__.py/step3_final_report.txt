{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface module for AWS Lambda SDK, primarily through static imports, class aliasing, and documentation for usage.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only from static import statements and documentation strings; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "The code flow is limited to import and alias assignment, with no dynamic data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present. The large docstring is purely informational.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module importing classes and functions from internal modules, defining a client alias, and exposing these via __all__. It contains a comprehensive docstring with usage examples but no executable logic beyond imports. No network activity, data handling, or dynamic code execution occurs. The structure is typical for an SDK wrapper, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static SDK interface module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concerns. The scores are consistent with this assessment, assigning zero to malware and obfuscation, and a very low risk score (0) reflecting its static, safe nature.",
