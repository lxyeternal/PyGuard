{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for AWS Lambda service, importing necessary clients, paginators, and waiters for interacting with Lambda functions.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and classes from local files (.client, .paginator, .waiter). It does not read external inputs or data sources directly.",
  "sinks": "The code defines classes and aliases but does not execute any untrusted data handling or network communication within this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows present in this static code; it mainly sets up imports and aliasing for later use.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code appears to be a standard module setup for AWS SDK interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, class aliasing, and export definitions. It imports classes for AWS Lambda interaction from local modules, which are presumably SDK wrappers or generated stubs. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or data handling occurs here. The structure follows typical Python package design, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors. The licensing comment is straightforward, and no secrets or sensitive data are embedded. The overall structure suggests a standard SDK interface module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign module defining imports and aliases for AWS Lambda SDK interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in this static analysis.",
