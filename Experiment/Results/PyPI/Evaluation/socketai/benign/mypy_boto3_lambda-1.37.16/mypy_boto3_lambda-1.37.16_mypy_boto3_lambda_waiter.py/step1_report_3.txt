{
  "purpose": "Define type-annotated waiter classes for AWS Lambda service using boto3, enabling type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs module; method parameters using unpacked type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Method wait() parameters receive **kwargs with specific type definitions; no untrusted data handling or external sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to wait() methods flow from kwargs to internal wait logic; no external data flow or untrusted source handling detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code consists solely of class definitions, method signatures, and documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several subclasses of Waiter, each with a wait() method annotated with specific unpacked type definitions for parameters. All code appears to be straightforward class and method definitions, mainly serving type annotation and documentation purposes. There are no signs of code injection, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. Usage of type annotations and conditional import for Unpack shows attention to type safety, not obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, documentation-focused set of subclass definitions for waiters in boto3 Lambda SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, aiding in type safety and code clarity for boto3 waiters.",
