  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and waiter classes for AWS Lambda, based on imports and Python version handling.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; classes inherit from boto3's Waiter, with methods only for type annotations.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign boilerplate code for type safety.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9 — justified given the code's nature as type annotations and class definitions with no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1, defining typed waiters for boto3 Lambda.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious or suspicious code; straightforward class definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, documentation-oriented code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=1 — appropriate; the code is purely for type annotations.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, defining type-annotated waiter classes.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard class inheritance and method signatures.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, benign SDK extension.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=1 — consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, with focus on type safety.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity; standard class and method definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** Low security risk, purely type annotations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable; very low risk, no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines waiters with type annotations, no external or malicious operations.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard class extension.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely for type safety.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1), reflecting the code's benign, documentation, and type annotation nature.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's purpose.\n- The code is purely for type annotations and class structure, with no runtime or malicious behavior.\n- No changes needed; the evaluation appears accurate.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — no malicious intent detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 to 0.1 — very low, justified by the lack of security concerns.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate. The code is a safe, boilerplate set of type annotations for AWS Lambda waiters, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
