  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for potential issues, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of class definitions for AWS Lambda waiters, inheriting from boto3's Waiter class.\n- Methods are mainly 'wait' functions with type annotations, importing specific type definitions.\n- The code includes documentation links and conditional imports for compatibility.\n- No dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling is present.\n- The purpose appears to be enhancing type safety and documentation support for boto3 waiters.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in code:\n\n- **Presence of code logic:** No, the code only defines classes and method signatures; no actual logic or execution occurs.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No input validation, data processing, or external interactions that could be exploited.\n- **Obfuscation:** No, the code is straightforward.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n\n- **Type annotations:** The use of `Unpack` with conditional import is correct and standard.\n- **Documentation links:** Correct and helpful.\n- **Class structure:** Properly inherits from `Waiter`, with no issues.\n- **Method signatures:** Consistent and appropriately annotated.\n\n### Scores review:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk | Comments |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|----------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     | Correct; no malicious behavior. |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     | Correct; benign class definitions. |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     | Correct; straightforward, documentation-focused. |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   | Slightly higher, but still minimal risk; no malicious activity. |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     | Correct; purely type annotations. |\n\n**Note:** The only report with a non-zero risk score is #4, with 0.1, which is reasonable given the minimal, documentation-focused nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which is appropriate. No signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as expected.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0, with one at 0.1, which is acceptable given the context.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n\n- The reports assume the code is purely for type annotations and documentation, which appears accurate.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the code is standard boilerplate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and has no malware.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The purpose is to provide type annotations and documentation support for boto3 waiters.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk; purely type annotations and class definitions)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code is a benign, well-structured utility for type safety in boto3 Lambda waiters.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed.",
