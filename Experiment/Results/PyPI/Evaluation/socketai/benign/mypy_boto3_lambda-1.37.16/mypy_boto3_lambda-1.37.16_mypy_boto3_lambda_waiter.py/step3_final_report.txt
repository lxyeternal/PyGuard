  "purpose": "Defines type-annotated waiter classes for AWS Lambda, facilitating type safety and documentation support for boto3 clients.",
  "sources": "Import statements for boto3 waiters, type definitions, and Python version handling logic.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; purely class and method definitions with documentation links.",
  "flows": "Class inheritance from boto3's Waiter, method signatures with type annotations, no runtime data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions, conditional import for compatibility, no obfuscation or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions inheriting from boto3's Waiter, with 'wait' methods annotated for type safety. It includes documentation links and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, code injection, or obfuscation. The purpose is to provide type annotations and documentation support for AWS Lambda waiters. The code is static, with no runtime behavior or external data handling, indicating a benign utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, documentation-oriented set of class definitions for AWS Lambda waiters, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible (close to 0). The high risk scores in some reports are overly conservative given the static, benign nature of the code.",
