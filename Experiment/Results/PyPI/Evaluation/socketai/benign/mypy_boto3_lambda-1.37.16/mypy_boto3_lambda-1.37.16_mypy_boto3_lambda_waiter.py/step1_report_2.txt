{
  "purpose": "Define typed waiters for AWS Lambda service using boto3, providing type annotations and documentation links for improved IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, Waiter class from botocore.waiter, and type definitions from local module .type_defs.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no untrusted data handling, network calls, or system modifications present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines classes inheriting from Waiter and their wait methods with type annotations. No data flow involving untrusted input leading to dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is straightforward class and method definitions with documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several subclasses of Waiter, each with a wait method accepting **kwargs with specific type annotations. It imports necessary modules, manages compatibility for typing.Unpack, and provides thorough docstrings with links. No suspicious or malicious logic, network activity, or security-critical operations are found. The code appears to be solely for type annotations and documentation support, without runtime behavior that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type-annotated waiter class definitions for boto3 Lambda waiters. No malicious intent or security risks are evident, and it serves as a type hinting utility with no harmful behavior.",
