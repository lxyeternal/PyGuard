{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and waiter classes for AWS Lambda service client in boto3, enabling better type safety and usability.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially reading from sys.version_info, and the method signatures with **kwargs for waiters.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code primarily defines classes and method signatures without executing untrusted data or system commands.",
  "flows": "Class definitions and method signatures flow from class inheritance to method annotations, with no dynamic execution or data handling that could be exploited.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are present. The code mostly consists of type annotations and class structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple waiter classes inheriting from boto3's Waiter, with methods 'wait' accepting various **kwargs typed with imported type defs. It uses conditional import for 'Unpack' based on Python version, which is standard. There are no input/output handling, network operations, or code execution that could indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for AWS SDK type annotations, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical type-annotated class structure for AWS Lambda waiters, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a safe, boilerplate enhancement for type safety.",
