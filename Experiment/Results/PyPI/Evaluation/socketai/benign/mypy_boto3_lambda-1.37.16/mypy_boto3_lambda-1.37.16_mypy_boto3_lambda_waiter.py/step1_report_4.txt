{
  "purpose": "Define typed waiters for AWS Lambda service using boto3, providing structured interfaces for waiting on specific Lambda function states.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method signatures, and type annotations that specify how the waiters interact with AWS Lambda resources.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to 'wait' on Waiter subclasses, which invoke AWS SDK operations; potential data leaks if waiters are misused, but no external data sinks or network actions are directly present.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of waiter objects -> calling 'wait' method with specific keyword arguments -> interaction with AWS API through underlying boto3 waiters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, or backdoors detected. Usage of type annotations and detailed docstrings appears standard. No obfuscated code features or unnecessary dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions extending the boto3 'Waiter' class, with method signatures for 'wait' functions annotated with specific types. All type annotations reference external type definitions, indicating a focus on type safety. The imports and class implementations appear standard, with links to documentation. No data leaks, malicious network activity, or suspicious logic were found. The code is well-structured, typical for a type-annotated SDK wrapper, and does not exhibit signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is low.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines type-safe waiters for AWS Lambda in a manner consistent with standard SDK practices. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a benign, well-structured SDK extension, primarily serving as type annotations and interface definitions.",
