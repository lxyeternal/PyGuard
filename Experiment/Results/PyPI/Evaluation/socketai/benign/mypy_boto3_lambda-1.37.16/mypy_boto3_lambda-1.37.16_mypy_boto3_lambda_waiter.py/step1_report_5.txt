{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and waiter class definitions for AWS Lambda client operations, specifically for waiters like 'function_active', 'function_exists', etc., facilitating type-safe interactions with boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs; class method parameters receiving **kwargs with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not execute untrusted data or perform network, file, or command operations.",
  "flows": "Class methods accept **kwargs with specific types but do not process or manipulate external data sources; no data flow to external systems is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are evident. The code structure is straightforward, primarily defining classes and methods with documented docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines subclasses of the Waiter class with overridden wait methods accepting specific typed kwargs, primarily for type hinting. No dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or external interactions are present. All imports are standard, and the code adheres to typical type annotation practices. The only noteworthy aspect is the conditional import based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured set of class definitions for typing AWS Lambda waiters. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is purely for type annotation and class extension purposes, with no external data processing or security-sensitive operations.",
