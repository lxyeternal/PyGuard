  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Explains the code's role in providing type annotations for AWS Lambda waiters, based on import statements and method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows indicating malicious activity; mainly class definitions and method signatures.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard boilerplate for type annotations, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.9 — *appropriate*, given it's a boilerplate, but the high risk score seems slightly conservative but acceptable considering the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining typed waiters with documentation links.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, straightforward class definitions for type hints.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 1 — *reasonable*, given it's purely type annotations with no runtime behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, defining type-annotated waiters with clear documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; standard type annotation classes.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 1 — *appropriate*.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar purpose, with detailed analysis.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious signs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a benign SDK extension with low security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — *reasonable*, given the low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, for type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clearly benign, purely for type hinting.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — *appropriate*.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1), reflecting the benign nature. The first report's higher score (0.9) is somewhat conservative but acceptable given the boilerplate nature, especially since it involves class inheritance and method signatures that could be misinterpreted without context.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a set of class definitions for AWS Lambda waiters, primarily serving as type annotations and documentation links.\n- No dynamic execution, data handling, or network operations that could be malicious.\n- The use of conditional import for `Unpack` is standard for compatibility, not obfuscation.\n- The overall security risk is minimal, and the scores are consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, primarily because it's boilerplate code for type annotations, with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose as a type hinting utility for AWS Lambda waiters.",
