  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code provides type annotations and waiter classes for AWS Lambda in boto3. It contains class definitions, method signatures, and documentation links.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no data leaks, no dynamic execution, no network calls. The code is boilerplate for type safety.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** The report assigns malware = 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, reasonable given the straightforward nature.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; the code is safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, defining typed waiters with documentation links.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no external data handling, no code injection.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, fully aligned.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns; code appears benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Defines waiter classes with type annotations, focusing on type safety.\n- **Findings:** No malicious logic, no external data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, justified.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—type-safe waiter class definitions.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no external interactions, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, justified.\n- **Assessment:** No security issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Defines waiter classes for AWS Lambda with type annotations.\n- **Findings:** No external data handling, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0, matches the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1, justified.\n- **Assessment:** Safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n- **Risk Score:** All are appropriately low (0), reflecting no security risks.\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently 0, aligning with the analysis.\n- **Type Safety & Documentation:** The code is purely for type annotations and class definitions, serving as boilerplate or SDK utility code.\n\n### Final Justified Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe, boilerplate extension for AWS Lambda waiters in boto3, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores given in the reports are reasonable and should remain as they are.",
