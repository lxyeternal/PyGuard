  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely static type alias definitions for AWS Lambda and related service string literals.\n- No dynamic data handling, external input, or runtime logic is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, backdoors, or secret handling.\n- The conditional import of `Literal` based on Python version is standard practice.\n- The copyright date is 2025, which is future-dated and unusual, but not malicious.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code does not perform any runtime operations or data processing; it only defines type aliases.\n   - No vulnerabilities, malware, or malicious patterns are evident.\n   - The only anomaly is the future year in the copyright, which might be a placeholder or oversight but is not malicious.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n   - They do not overstate or understate the risk.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each report:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is correct.\n   - The code is static, non-executable, and contains no malicious patterns.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is justified.\n   - No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about potential vulnerabilities.\n   - They focus on the static nature and purpose of the code.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are evident.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward static type alias module for AWS Lambda literals.\n- It is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n- The only oddity is the future copyright year, which is likely a placeholder or typo.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. The code is safe, standard for type annotations, and presents no security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, static type alias definition module for AWS Lambda string literals.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The reports' assessments and scores are justified and accurate.\n- I concur with their conclusions and would assign the same low-risk scores.",
