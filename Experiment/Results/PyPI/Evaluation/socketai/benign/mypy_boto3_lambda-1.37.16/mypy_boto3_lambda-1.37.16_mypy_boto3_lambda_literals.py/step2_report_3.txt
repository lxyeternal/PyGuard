  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using `Literal` for AWS Lambda and related service constants.\n- No dynamic code, no data processing, no external input handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no runtime logic.\n- The only unusual aspect is the copyright date set to 2025, which is future-dated, but this is likely a placeholder or a typo and not malicious.\n\n**2. Logical flaws or mistakes in the report:**\n- The reports consistently state that the code is benign, static, and solely for type annotations.\n- They correctly identify the conditional import pattern for `Literal` based on Python version.\n- No report mentions any code that could be malicious or malicious intent.\n- The only potential concern is the future copyright year, but that is not a security issue.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each report:**\n- All reports assign malware score = 0, security risk = 0, confidence = very high (mostly 1 or 0.95).\n- These scores are reasonable given the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n- No adjustments needed; the scores align with the analysis.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- The code does not perform any runtime operations, data handling, or external interactions.\n- No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- The only anomaly is the future date, which does not impact security.\n- Therefore, risk scores higher than 0.5 are unjustified.\n\n**5. Malware score justification:**\n- Malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- No malicious activity, code injection, or hidden payloads are present.\n\n**6. Assumptions about vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they identify the code as purely static type annotations.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature: static, benign, no runtime or external data processing.\n- No discrepancies observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a straightforward, well-structured static type alias module for AWS Lambda and related services. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.**\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (completely benign, static definitions)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign, static type annotation module for AWS Lambda configurations, with no security concerns. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and justified.",
