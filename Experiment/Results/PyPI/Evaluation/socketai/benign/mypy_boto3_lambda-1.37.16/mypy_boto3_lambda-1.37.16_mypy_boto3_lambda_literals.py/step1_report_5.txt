  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS Lambda and related services to enable type safety and autocompletion.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions, hardcoded string literals defining types and constants.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines type aliases and constants, no data processing or output.",
  "flows": "N/A; there are no data flows or untrusted data sources and sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward type alias definitions with no unusual code structures, obfuscation, or secret handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules conditionally based on Python version, then declares multiple string literal types representing various AWS service parameters. The literals are static and hardcoded, serving as type hints for better code assistance. There are no functions, data manipulations, or external data reads. No suspicious or malicious code, no dynamic execution, or potential backdoors. The code's purpose is purely to enhance type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a safe, static set of type alias definitions for AWS-related string literals. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured module for type annotations.",
