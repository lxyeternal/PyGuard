  "purpose": "Defines static type aliases for AWS Lambda and related service string literals using Python's Literal type for type checking.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version check for 'Literal', and string literal assignments for each type alias.",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains only static type alias definitions with no data input or output handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the copyright year set to 2025, which appears to be a placeholder or typo but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions for AWS Lambda and other AWS services, with conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version. No runtime logic, data processing, or external input handling is present. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected. The only anomaly is the future-dated copyright year, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of the code, and their assigned scores of malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 are justified.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, static collection of type aliases for AWS Lambda and related services, with no malicious or security concerns. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not a security issue.",
