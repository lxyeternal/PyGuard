  "purpose": "Define type aliases for AWS Lambda service literals using Python type annotations for better code clarity and static type checking.",
  "sources": "Import statement for sys and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions depending on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output found.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely defining constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors; the code is straightforward type alias definitions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a descriptive comment block including documentation links, author copyright, and usage examples. It conditionally imports Literal based on Python version, which is a standard compatibility pattern. The rest of the code defines numerous Literal type aliases representing AWS Lambda configuration options and related enumerations, all static strings. These are simply type annotations and do not perform any runtime operations or data processing. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network connections, system modifications, or data leaks. The code's structure is clean and adheres to standard practices for type hinting in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a set of type alias definitions intended for static type checking. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign, well-structured module for use with type hints in Python projects involving AWS Lambda configurations.",
