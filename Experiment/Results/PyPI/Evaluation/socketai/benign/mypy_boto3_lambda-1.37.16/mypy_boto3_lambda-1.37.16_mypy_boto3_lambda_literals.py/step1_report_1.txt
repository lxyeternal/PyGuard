{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literal types used in a boto3 Lambda service stub module, aiding static type checking.",
  "sources": "The module reads the import statements, version check, and the assignment of string literals to type alias variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or untrusted input; the code only defines type aliases with fixed string literals.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely establishes type annotations without processing runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code is straightforward type alias definitions. The copyright date is 2025, which is future-dated and unusual, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines numerous type aliases as string literals, mostly related to AWS Lambda configuration. No dynamic execution, no external input handling, and no code injection or malicious pattern is present. The only atypical aspect is the future copyright year, which might suggest an inconsistency or placeholder but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, structured collection of type alias definitions for static typing support in boto3 Lambda stubs. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It is a standard, non-malicious module for type annotations.",
