{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations for various string literals used as enumerations in a boto3 Lambda service library, providing type safety and documentation support.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines constants and imports, primarily for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks occurs; the code consists solely of type alias definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and static, serving as type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code uses conditional import for the 'Literal' type from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions', which is standard for compatibility across Python versions. It defines a large set of string literal types for use as enumerations, which are typical for type-safe API definitions. No runtime logic, user input handling, or external data processing exists. The code appears to be a static type annotation module without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that provides type annotations for boto3 Lambda literals. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is purely to enhance type safety and documentation.",
