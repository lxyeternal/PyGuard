  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS Lambda and other AWS service string constants used for type annotations and static analysis.",
  "sources": "Reading the module import statements, checking the inclusion of data type definitions, and the hardcoded string literals representing AWS constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no dynamic data sinks or untrusted data processing; the code primarily defines constants and type annotations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted inputs; the code only declares type literals used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward type annotation definitions, with no runtime code or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides Python type annotations using Literal types for AWS service string constants, primarily for type safety and static analysis. It conditionally imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version, which is standard practice. The __all__ list declares exported names. No dynamic execution, input/output processing, or data manipulation is present. There are no suspicious patterns, code injection, or obfuscation present. The license comment and the content indicate documentation and type definitions only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of type alias definitions for AWS string constants. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It is purely static data declaration for use in type annotations.",
