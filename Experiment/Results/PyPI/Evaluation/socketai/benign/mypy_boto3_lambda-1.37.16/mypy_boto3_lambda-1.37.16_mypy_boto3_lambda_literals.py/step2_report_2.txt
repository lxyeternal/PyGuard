  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual content, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code defines type aliases for AWS Lambda string literals, based on import statements and variable assignments.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or dynamic data flows; purely static type definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes the future-dated copyright (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurately states that the code is benign, straightforward, and intended for static type checking. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning is sound. The high confidence (0.95) is justified. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the static nature of the type literal definitions, with no dynamic or untrusted data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow involving untrusted input.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, just static constants.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is benign, static, and purely for type annotations.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No concerns or adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as static type annotations, with no runtime logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external input handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; straightforward static definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Well-reasoned, recognizing the code as benign, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code defines string literal types for AWS Lambda and related services.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately concludes that the code is a benign static type annotation module.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the static nature of the type aliases.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dynamic or untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; straightforward static definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes the code as a safe, static set of type annotations.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a collection of static type alias definitions for AWS Lambda and other AWS service string literals.\n- **Malware & Security Risks:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present.\n- **Anomalies:** The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year (2025), which might be a placeholder or typo but is not malicious.\n- **Scoring:** All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — static definitions pose no security threat.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nWhile the copyright date is future-dated, this does not impact security assessment. It might warrant correction but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a benign, well-structured static type annotation module with no security risks or malicious intent.",
