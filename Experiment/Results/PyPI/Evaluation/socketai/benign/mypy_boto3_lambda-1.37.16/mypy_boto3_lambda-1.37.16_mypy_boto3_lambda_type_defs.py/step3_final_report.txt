  "purpose": "Type annotations for AWS Lambda SDK data structures and interactions, providing static type definitions for improved code clarity, IDE support, and type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, local literals, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, network calls, or runtime code; purely static data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "None; the code contains only type definitions and no data flow or executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; standard static type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of TypedDict and type alias definitions for AWS Lambda SDK, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It contains no runtime logic, external data handling, or network operations. The purpose is solely to provide static type information for developers and tools. No signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured static type definition module for AWS Lambda SDK in Python. It serves as documentation and static analysis aid, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
