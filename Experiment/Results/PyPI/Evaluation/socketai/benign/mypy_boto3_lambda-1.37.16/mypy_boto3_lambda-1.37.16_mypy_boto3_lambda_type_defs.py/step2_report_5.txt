  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, potential issues, or overlooked risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations for AWS Lambda SDK interactions, with no suspicious sinks or data flows. It is purely static type definitions, compatible across Python versions, with no runtime or network operations.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is solely for static type checking, with no malicious behavior. The confidence is high (1.0), and no anomalies or security risks are detected.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the purpose of defining type annotations for AWS Lambda in Python, with no untrusted data handling or runtime logic. The code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious patterns.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature. The report correctly notes the absence of runtime code, network operations, or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The assessment appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a static collection of type definitions for AWS Lambda SDK data structures, with no runtime logic, network calls, or dynamic code. No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly interprets the code as purely declarative, with no malicious activity. The high confidence (1.0) is appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The report's conclusion is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides detailed type annotations for AWS Lambda SDK, with extensive type definitions, conditional imports, and no runtime or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent with the code's purpose. No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks are identified.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a set of type definitions for AWS Lambda interactions, with no untrusted data handling, runtime logic, or security concerns.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly states that the code is purely declarative, with no malicious patterns or security risks.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely for static type annotations, with no executable logic, network operations, or data handling that could introduce security risks.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** None of the reports mention any inaccuracies or logical flaws. They all consistently interpret the code as benign.\n\n- **Scores and Justification:**\n  - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n  - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n  - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or very low, justified by the absence of runtime or malicious code.\n\n- **Potential Concerns:** The only possible concern could be the extensive use of type annotations, but this is standard for SDK type definition files and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated overall security risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, purely declarative set of type annotations for AWS Lambda SDK interactions. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are evident. It is a standard part of SDK tooling aimed at static type safety and developer support.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose without any security concerns.",
