{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS Lambda service data structures to facilitate type-safe interactions within Python code.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, and botocore; type definitions for various request and response structures; hardcoded string literals for specific AWS-related identifiers.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code primarily defines types and does not execute any data processing, network, or file I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; the code is purely declarative with no executable logic or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The only potential concern is the presence of extensive type definitions, but these are standard for SDK type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides detailed type annotations for AWS Lambda SDK data structures using Python's typing system and TypedDict. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, and uses type aliases and unions to accommodate multiple data formats. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or any behavior that could be malicious. The extensive definitions serve as a type-safe layer for SDK usage. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions intended for static type checking of AWS Lambda SDK interactions. It contains no malicious code, no runtime logic, and no indicators of supply chain attack behavior. The overall security risk is very low.",
