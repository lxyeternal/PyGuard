  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for AWS Lambda service definitions and responses in Python.",
  "sources": "Type annotations for various request and response types, including function configuration, event source mappings, and other AWS Lambda related data structures.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily defines data structures and type annotations.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to structured data assignments for API request/response modeling; no runtime or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code strictly defines TypedDict data models without any executable or network code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The import of libraries is standard, and there are no dynamic code execution or obfuscation indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for AWS Lambda SDK interactions, utilizing conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It defines various TypedDict classes representing request parameters, response structures, and configuration details. The code adheres to best practices for type annotations and does not contain any runtime logic, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed, and the purpose is solely to facilitate static type checking.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign collection of type definitions for AWS Lambda SDK in Python. It does not include any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of an SDK or type hinting library aimed at ensuring type safety and clarity.",
