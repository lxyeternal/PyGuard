{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Lambda service responses and requests, facilitating type checking and code clarity in SDK or client implementations.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard library modules, conditional imports for compatibility, and type definitions including variables, classes, and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or data processing with security implications are present; mainly data type definitions and constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, as this code solely defines data structures and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are present. The code is purely declarative, focusing on type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a comprehensive set of type definitions (TypedDicts, Unions, etc.) for AWS Lambda API requests and responses. It includes conditional imports for compatibility, extensive type annotations for various request and response objects, and documentation. There is no runtime logic, no data handling, no code execution, and no indication of malicious activities or sabotage. It appears to be a standard, well-structured type definition module designed to improve code quality and correctness when interacting with AWS Lambda services.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of type definitions for AWS SDK interactions with Lambda, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely declarative, intended for type safety and clarity. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
