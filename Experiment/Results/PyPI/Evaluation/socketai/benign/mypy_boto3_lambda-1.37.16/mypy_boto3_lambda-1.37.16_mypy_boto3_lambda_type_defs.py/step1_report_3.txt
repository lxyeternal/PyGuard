{
  "purpose": "The provided code defines extensive type annotations and data structures for AWS Lambda service interactions, primarily for use with boto3 stub files to facilitate type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type annotations, imported literals, and external type definitions from Python standard libraries, typing_extensions, and botocore.response/stream modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted external data or user input directly; the code strictly defines data structures and type annotations without executing external commands or data processing.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows are present; the code only establishes type definitions and class structures, with no dynamic or runtime data flows or code execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a comprehensive set of type definitions for AWS Lambda SDK responses and requests. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or unusual behaviors. All imports are standard, and no code executes any actions beyond type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining TypedDicts, Unions, and type aliases for AWS Lambda API interactions. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard practice for compatibility. No runtime code, user input processing, or potentially malicious patterns such as network access, command execution, or data exfiltration are present. The purpose is solely to aid static type checking and IDE features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a purely declarative set of type definitions and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a static schema for AWS Lambda SDK data structures, with no signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
