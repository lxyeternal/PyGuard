  "review": "Let's proceed with a detailed review of each report, focusing on the key aspects:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for AWS Lambda SDK, derived from standard libraries and local literals.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or network operations; purely static type definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected; straightforward type definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely declarative, serving as static metadata for type checking. No runtime or malicious behavior is present.\n- **Risk Assessment:** Malware score = 0, security risk = 0, consistent with the report's conclusion.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns well with the code's nature. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—type annotations for AWS Lambda, including request/response models.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing; static data structures only.\n- **Anomalies:** No dynamic code, secrets, or obfuscation; standard import practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a set of static type definitions, with no runtime logic or malicious patterns.\n- **Risk Assessment:** Malware score = 0, security risk = 0, consistent with the report.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity; the report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Extensive type annotations for AWS Lambda, designed for static type checking.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow from untrusted sources; purely data modeling.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no secrets, no dynamic code. All imports are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is declarative, with no runtime or malicious behavior.\n- **Risk Assessment:** Malware score = 0, security risk = 0, matching the report.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar detailed type definitions for AWS Lambda SDK.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No handling of untrusted data; purely static type annotations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions, serving static analysis purposes.\n- **Risk Assessment:** Malware score = 0, security risk = 0, consistent with the report.\n\n**Verdict:** The code is safe and purely declarative.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type definitions for AWS Lambda SDK interactions, standard for SDKs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or runtime logic.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static type annotations with no malicious intent.\n- **Risk Assessment:** Malware score = 0, security risk = 0, aligns with the report.\n\n**Verdict:** No security concerns; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate a score of 0, which is appropriate given the purely declarative nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, as the code contains no runtime logic, network operations, or data handling that could pose security risks.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Lambda SDK interactions.\n- It uses standard Python typing practices, conditional imports for compatibility, and no dynamic or executable code.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The purpose is solely to improve static type checking, documentation, and IDE support.\n\n### **Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across all reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, static type definition module for AWS Lambda SDK in Python, with no malicious or security concerns. The current scoring and conclusions are appropriate.",
