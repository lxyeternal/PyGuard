  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS Lambda service definitions to enable type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.response, botocore.eventstream, and local literals module. Type definitions derived from these imports and inline structures.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks detected; no untrusted data handling or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Type annotations primarily define data structures; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code strictly defines data types for SDK responses and requests. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of TypedDict definitions for AWS Lambda API request and response structures, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. No runtime code or network operations are present. The file is solely for type annotations, which serve as static metadata. There are no code injection points, no handling of untrusted inputs, nor any side-effect inducing code. The overall structure is straightforward and aligns with standard SDK type definition patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations for AWS Lambda SDK interactions, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, purely structural module intended for type safety and documentation.",
