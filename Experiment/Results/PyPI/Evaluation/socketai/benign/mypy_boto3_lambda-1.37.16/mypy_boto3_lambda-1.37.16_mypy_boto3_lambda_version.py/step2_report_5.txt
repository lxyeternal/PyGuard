  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No input/output, data flows, or external interactions are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious code constructs are identified.\n- The only anomaly noted is the future-dated copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or an intentional future date, but it does not imply malicious intent.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code snippets are identical in purpose and structure.\n- The code is benign, serving solely as a version identifier.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or security risks are present according to all reports.\n\n**Critical review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The code is straightforward; no issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as benign and typical for version declaration.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   These are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports assign a high risk score. This is appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score reflection:**  \n   All reports assign `malware`: 0, which is correct. No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   No such claims are made. The analysis is cautious and correct.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- The future date (2025) is unusual but not malicious. It could be a typo or an intentional future date, but it does not affect security.\n- No obfuscation or hidden code is present.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0      | No malicious code or behavior detected.                     |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.            |\n| Security Risk      | 0      | No vulnerabilities or risky behavior identified.           |\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The only minor note is the future date, which is not a concern here.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. All reports correctly identify this, and I agree with their assessments.",
