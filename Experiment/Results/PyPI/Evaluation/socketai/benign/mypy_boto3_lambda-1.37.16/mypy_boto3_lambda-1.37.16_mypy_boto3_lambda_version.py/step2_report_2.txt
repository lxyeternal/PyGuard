  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no input sources, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - No dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is present.\n   - The only unusual aspect is the future-dated copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or an intentional future date, but it does not introduce any security concern.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The mention of the future date is correctly dismissed as non-malicious.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - Since there is no malicious code, no malware, and no obfuscation, scores of 0 are justified.\n   - The code's purpose is purely to define version info, which is standard practice.\n   - The future date does not elevate the risk; it is not suspicious or malicious.\n\n5. **Challenging Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward static analysis.\n   - No assumptions about hidden behavior are made; the code is transparent.\n   - The analysis correctly dismisses the future date as non-malicious.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - All reports are consistent with each other and with the code content.\n   - The assigned scores accurately reflect the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string with no dynamic behavior, no external data interaction, and no suspicious constructs. The future date does not impact security or malware considerations. Therefore, the scores are appropriately zero across the board.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements are present.\n- The reports' evaluations are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.",
