  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no input sources, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - The code contains only a docstring comment and a variable assignment.\n   - No obfuscation, dynamic code, or malicious payloads are present.\n\n2. **Anomalies & Future Date:**\n   - The only anomaly noted is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to the present date (assuming current date is before 2025). This is likely a typo or an oversight but not malicious.\n\n3. **Security & Malware Assessment:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, with malware scores of 0.\n   - No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n   - The code serves a typical purpose in package versioning.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious elements.\n   - The confidence score of 1 is justified; the analysis is straightforward and consistent across reports.\n\n5. **Potential Risks & Assumptions:**\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are based on assumptions; the code is clearly benign.\n   - The only \"suspicious\" aspect is the future copyright date, which does not influence security.\n\n6. **Consistency & Recommendations:**\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment.\n   - No changes needed in the scoring or reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary & My Own Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks present.\n\nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns. The future date is likely a typo or placeholder and does not affect security.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the existing assessments.**",
