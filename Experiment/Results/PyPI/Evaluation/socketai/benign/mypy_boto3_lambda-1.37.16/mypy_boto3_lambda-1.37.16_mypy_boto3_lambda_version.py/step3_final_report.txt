  "flows": "None; the code is static with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year 2025, which is likely a typo or placeholder but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string with a docstring comment. No input sources, data flows, or external interactions are present. The code contains no obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious constructs. The only anomaly is the future date, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code serves a standard purpose in package versioning and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The future date is likely a typo or placeholder. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
