  "purpose": "Define and expose the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ with a static string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data processing or transmission.",
  "flows": "N/A — static assignment without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, secrets, or unusual constructs. The only notable element is the copyright statement with a future date.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to the __version__ variable. It contains a copyright statement dated 2025, which is in the future relative to the knowledge cutoff but does not affect code behavior or security. There are no sources of untrusted data, no data flows, and no malicious or suspicious code constructs present. The code is straightforward and serves a purpose of version tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or contain any malicious behavior.",
