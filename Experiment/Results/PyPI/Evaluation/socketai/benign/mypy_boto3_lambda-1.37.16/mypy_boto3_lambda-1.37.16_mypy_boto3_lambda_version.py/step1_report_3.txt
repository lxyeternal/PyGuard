  "analysis": "The code contains a copyright statement and sets a version string variable. There are no input sources, no data processing, or untrusted data handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code elements are present. The only action is assigning a string to a variable, which is typical for package versioning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with a copyright notice. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign, intentional part of a package's metadata.",
