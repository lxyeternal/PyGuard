  "purpose": "Defines the version string for the package or module, serving as a source of truth for versioning.",
  "sources": "The assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data input or output points.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward version assignment, no hardcoded credentials or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a docstring comment and a variable assignment setting a version string. There are no suspicious functions, data handling, or code execution paths. The comment indicates a copyright date, which is unrelated to malicious intent. The code is minimal and typical for version control in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving solely as a version indicator with no malicious behavior detected.",
