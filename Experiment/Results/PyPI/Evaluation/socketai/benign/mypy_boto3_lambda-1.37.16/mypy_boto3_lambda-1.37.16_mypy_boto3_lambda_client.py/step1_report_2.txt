  "purpose": "Type annotations and client wrapper for AWS Lambda service, facilitating type-safe interactions with the Lambda API.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries, third-party dependencies (botocore, typing, sys), and internal modules for request/response types, paginators, waiters, and exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Methods defining API calls with parameters that could potentially accept untrusted data (kwargs), which are then used to invoke AWS Lambda API endpoints. No direct untrusted data handling or external network actions are evident within this code itself.",
  "flows": "User code calls methods with kwargs unpacked from external sources, which then interface with AWS Lambda API endpoints; internal methods and properties manage type safety and API interaction.",
  "anomalies": "The code is primarily boilerplate for a type-safe client wrapper around the AWS Lambda API. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are present. Use of dynamic typing and overloads is standard for boto3 type stubs. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behaviors, or external data exfiltration activities.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations, client interface, and method signatures for AWS Lambda API operations, leveraging overloads for paginators and waiters. No executable logic or data handling beyond API parameter passing is included. The structure aligns with standard boto3 stub definitions. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected; it appears to be a standard, type-safe interface implementation for AWS Lambda.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a type-safe wrapper and stub interface for the AWS Lambda client, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is intended for use as part of a larger application that interacts with AWS Lambda services. No malicious or sabotage signals are present.",
