{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and method definitions for a Python client interface to AWS Lambda, including documentation links and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard library, botocore, and internal modules; class and method definitions; property and overload declarations.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data input or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Method calls and property accesses, all within a controlled class interface; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors identified. Use of extensive type annotations and overloads for API support is standard for SDK stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, class and method declarations, property definitions, and overloads to support a typed SDK interface for AWS Lambda. It includes comprehensive documentation links, exception class definitions, and method signatures for various Lambda operations. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. The import statements are standard, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic are evident. The overall structure aligns with a well-documented SDK stub file intended for type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured type stub implementation for the AWS Lambda client. It provides type hints, documentation, and method signatures without any indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
