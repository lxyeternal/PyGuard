  "purpose": "Type annotations and method signatures for a Python AWS Lambda client SDK stub, intended for static type checking and developer assistance.",
  "sources": "Method parameters unpacked from type definition modules, class attributes, and imported modules for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external network activity, or data exfiltration; methods are purely signatures for API calls.",
  "flows": "Parameters flow from kwargs unpacked from type definitions into API method calls; no external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured SDK stub with extensive type annotations, overloads for paginators and waiters, and documentation links. It contains no runtime logic, network activity, or security vulnerabilities. The structure is standard for SDK interface definitions, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-formed SDK stub for AWS Lambda, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves solely for static type checking and developer tooling.",
