{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS Lambda service, enabling type-safe interactions with AWS Lambda API via boto3 and stubs.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method signatures, and property definitions that specify API interactions and data types.",
  "sinks": "Method calls that could potentially invoke or manage AWS Lambda functions, configurations, and permissions; no direct untrusted data handling or external network activity present.",
  "flows": "Method signatures indicate source data (parameters) flow into API calls; no evidence of malicious data flow or external data exfiltration pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns such as obfuscated logic, hidden network activity, or hardcoded secrets. The code is predominantly type definitions, class interfaces, and documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive type-annotated interface for AWS Lambda client, including method signatures, property types, and overloads for paginators and waiters. It relies on standard AWS SDK patterns and uses type hints for safer API usage. No code executes malicious commands, connects to external domains, or handles untrusted input in a suspicious manner. Documentation links reference AWS resources and boto3 documentation, consistent with standard SDK implementations. The structure and content suggest this is a benign, well-structured client interface with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign API client interface with extensive type annotations for AWS Lambda, serving as a type-safe wrapper around boto3. No malicious activity or sabotage detected.",
