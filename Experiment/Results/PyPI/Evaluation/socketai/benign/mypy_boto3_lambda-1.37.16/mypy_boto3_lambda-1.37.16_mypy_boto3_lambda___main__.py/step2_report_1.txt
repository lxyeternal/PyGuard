  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It imports only the `sys` module.\n   - No dynamic data processing, network calls, or external dependencies.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - The functions `print_info()` and `print_version()` simply write static strings to stdout.\n   - The main function checks for `--version` argument and responds accordingly.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior Assessment:**\n   - No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n   - No data exfiltration, code injection, or external communication.\n   - The code's purpose is purely informational.\n   - The logic is straightforward, with no complex or risky constructs.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious intent.\n   - They consistently identify no anomalies, obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1.0, indicating high certainty.\n   - The analysis in each report correctly reflects the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0.0, justified by the code's benign nature.\n   \n   Since the code is straightforward, static, and has no malicious indicators, these scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No discrepancies are evident.\n   - No claims are made based on assumptions; all observations are factual.\n   - The logic and reasoning are sound and consistent.\n\n6. **Final Expert Assessment:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n   - **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a simple, benign CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Summary of my estimates:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| 0.0             | 0.0                | 0.0        |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis, confirming the code's safety and benign nature.",
