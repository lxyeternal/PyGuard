{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a CLI entry point for a package that provides informational output about a Python package related to boto3 Lambda stubs.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv)",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout (sys.stdout.write)",
  "flows": "Command-line input (checking '--version') flows to output functions (print_version or print_info) which write static strings to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious actions present. The code is straightforward and primarily outputs static informational strings.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and uses a simple conditional in main() to decide which info to display based on command-line args. The output is static, and no untrusted input processing occurs. There are no network connections, no data exfiltration, and no code injection mechanisms. The structure is simple, and no obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI utility that outputs package information and version details. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
