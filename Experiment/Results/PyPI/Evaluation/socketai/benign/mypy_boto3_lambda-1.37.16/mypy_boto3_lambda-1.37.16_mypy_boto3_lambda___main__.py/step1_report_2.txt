  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides information about boto3 Lambda type annotations and version.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments; sys.stdout for output messages",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output; potential flow of data from argv to output (though only static strings are used)",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version() -> output to stdout; otherwise, print_info() -> output to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. The code only prints static information without external data fetching or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and defines functions to print static package information and version. The main() function checks for '--version' argument to decide which info to display. No user input data other than command-line args is processed. The output is static and directly written to stdout. There are no network calls, data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious code present. The code's purpose is straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI script that outputs package info and version upon request. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
