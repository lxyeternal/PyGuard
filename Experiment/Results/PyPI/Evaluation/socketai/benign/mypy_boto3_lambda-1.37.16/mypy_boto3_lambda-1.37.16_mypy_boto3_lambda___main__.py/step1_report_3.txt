  "purpose": "CLI script providing package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; writes output to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are written to stdout, which could potentially be captured or redirected; no other sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) triggers output functions (print_version or print_info), which output static or predefined data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed. The code solely outputs static information.",
  "analysis": "The script performs simple CLI operations, checking for a '--version' argument to decide whether to print version info or package info. It uses standard sys module functions without external or dynamic data processing. No network activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and only outputs static information related to the package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package info or version, with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks identified.",
