  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility.\n- It imports `sys`.\n- Defines `print_info()` and `print_version()` functions that output static package details.\n- The `main()` function checks for the `--version` argument and calls the appropriate function.\n- No user input processing beyond argument checking.\n- No external data fetching, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The output is static, informational, and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No, the code is simple, static, and performs only output operations. No errors, flaws, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n\n- **Malicious activity or malware?**  \n  No. The code does not perform any malicious actions, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Security risks?**  \n  None apparent. The script only outputs static info.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1-5:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as benign, straightforward, and purely informational.\n- They note no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no external data, and no malicious intent.\n- The confidence score is 1.0 in all, which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0.0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0.0, appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The risk score should be 0.0 for all reports, as there are no vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns.\n- The malware score is correctly 0.0.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0.0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a straightforward CLI utility for displaying static package info.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
