  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument '--version' check, static string outputs in print_info() and print_version() functions",
  "sinks": "stdout writes of static strings; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks involved",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check flows to either print_version() or print_info() outputs, both static",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and free of obfuscation or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports only sys, defines functions to output static package info and version, and conditionally calls these based on command-line args. No dynamic data, network activity, or external dependencies are present. The code performs simple, safe output operations with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0.0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static behavior confirm it poses no security threats or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
