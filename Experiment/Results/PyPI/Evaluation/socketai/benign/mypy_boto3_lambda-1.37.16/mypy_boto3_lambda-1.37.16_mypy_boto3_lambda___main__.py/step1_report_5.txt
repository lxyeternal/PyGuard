  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, calls print_version() and outputs version; otherwise, calls print_info() to display package details.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors observed. The code solely handles simple input/output operations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version to stdout, and processes command-line arguments to determine which info to display. No external data sources, untrusted inputs, or risky behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and performs only informational output without any side effects or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying package information and version number. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
