  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n- It imports only the `sys` module.\n- No dynamic data processing, network calls, or external dependencies.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious constructs.\n- The logic is straightforward: check for `--version` argument, then print corresponding static info.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is simple, static, and benign.\n- **Code correctness:** The functions perform as intended, and the control flow is clear and safe.\n\n### Logical or Reasoning Flaws:\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident. The code is minimal and correct for its purpose.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0. All reports and the code show no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0. No obfuscation or code hiding techniques are used.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0. The code does not perform any risky operations or handle untrusted input beyond command-line args, which are standard.\n\n### Potential Misinterpretations or Assumptions:\n- The reports are consistent and do not assume any malicious intent.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the code is purely informational.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- All reports assign scores of 0.0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- The confidence level is 1.0, justified by the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, I concur that:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a benign CLI utility with no security issues.\n- No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Overall, I would assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with all reports and the code analysis.",
