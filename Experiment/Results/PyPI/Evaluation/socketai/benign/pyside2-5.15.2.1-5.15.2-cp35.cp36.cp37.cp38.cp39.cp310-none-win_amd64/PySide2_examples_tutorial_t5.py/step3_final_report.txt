  "purpose": "A simple PySide2 GUI application demonstrating basic widgets and signal-slot connections.",
  "sources": "User interactions with the Quit button, slider value changes",
  "sinks": "Display update on the LCD number, application quit command",
  "flows": "Button click triggers application quit; slider value change updates LCD display",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated Qt4-style signal-slot syntax, but no malicious or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward PySide2 GUI example with a Quit button, LCD display, and slider. It connects signals to slots to handle user interactions. No network activity, data exfiltration, or external data handling is present. The signal connections use deprecated syntax but are functionally harmless. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code does not process untrusted input beyond GUI interactions, which are local. All indicators point to benign, standard code with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard PySide2 GUI example with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero.",
