  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual content, logic, and purpose.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a simple script defining static version variables and printing them if run as the main module.\n- There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or data flows from untrusted sources.\n- The licensing comments are standard documentation and do not influence runtime behavior.\n- The code's purpose is to provide version information for build or packaging systems, which is common and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on the code:\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, static, and contains no malicious or suspicious logic.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  None. The code functions as intended, with proper structure for a version info script.\n\n- **Scores given in reports:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated code, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**  \n- Purpose: Generate and output version info.  \n- Sources: Static variables, no external input.  \n- Sinks: Print statement.  \n- Flows: Static data to output, no external data flow.  \n- Anomalies: None detected.  \n- Analysis: Correctly identifies the benign, static nature of the code.  \n- Conclusion: The assessments of no malicious intent or security issues are accurate.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware score: 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- Obfuscated score: 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- Security risk: 0 — no vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are justified based on the code.  \n- The code's purpose is standard for version reporting, with no hidden or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports correctly reflect the benign nature of the code. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a simple, static version information script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior. All reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's actual content.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n- No further action needed.",
