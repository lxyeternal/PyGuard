{
  "purpose": "The code defines version information for Qt for Python and prints it for use by build tools like CMake.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded version information variables and a conditional check for __name__ == '__main__'.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs version data, which could be used by external tools, but does not pose a security risk in itself.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded version variables are used in the print statement within a main guard, which outputs version info to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be standard versioning metadata with typical Python idioms.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily contains static version information variables. It performs a straightforward check for the main execution context and prints formatted version data. No user input, untrusted data, or external data sources are involved. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or malicious logic are present. The purpose seems to be for build or packaging metadata. Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version metadata script used in build processes. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security risks.",
