  "purpose": "Generate and output version information for Qt for Python, including version components and release type.",
  "sources": "Static string variables and the __name__ == '__main__' block with a print statement.",
  "sinks": "The print function outputs data, but it is only used to display version information; no untrusted data processing or external system interaction occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the flow is from static variables to a print statement when executed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and intended for version info output.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version information variables as static strings. The main block outputs these variables in a formatted string via print(). There are no inputs from external sources, no dynamic code execution, and no network or file system operations. The license comments are standard and do not contain executable code or secrets. The code's purpose appears to be to provide version details for a Qt for Python package. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended solely to output version information. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks.",
