  "sources": "Static variables defining version components; no external input.",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputting version info.",
  "flows": "Static data assigned to variables flows directly to output via print.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static version variables and prints them if executed as main. It contains no external data input, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. The licensing comments are standard documentation. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code are present. The code's purpose is benign, serving as a version info utility. All signals indicate no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static version reporting script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with its benign nature.",
