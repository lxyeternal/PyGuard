{
  "purpose": "The script appears to define version information for a Qt for Python package, including major, minor, patch versions, and release type details, and prints this information for use by build systems like CMake.",
  "sources": "Version variables assigned at the beginning; data is used in the print statement.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs version info, but no untrusted data or external system interaction occurs.",
  "flows": "Version variables are assigned from static strings and then formatted into the print statement; data flows from variable assignment to output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, no external data input, and no unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns static version information variables and outputs them using a formatted string. It contains no dynamic input, external data sources, or potentially dangerous operations. The print statement is used for build integration purposes and does not pose a security risk. The license comments are standard and do not influence code behavior. Overall, this code is benign and designed for versioning purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version info script with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and serves as a utility for build systems.",
