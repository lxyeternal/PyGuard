{
  "purpose": "This script generates and prints version information for Qt for Python, including major, minor, patch versions, and release type details.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only uses hardcoded version strings and a conditional that checks if the script is run as the main module.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the print statement which outputs version information to the standard output.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows exist. The static version data flows directly to the output without any modification or external input.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code uses straightforward, static variables and simple string formatting. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static version variables and conditionally prints them if run directly. The structure is simple, with no dynamic data handling, no user input, no network operations, and no security-sensitive code. The licensing comments are documentation and do not affect runtime behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign version information generator with no malicious intent or security issues. It serves a simple purpose of reporting version data and contains no suspicious or harmful code.",
