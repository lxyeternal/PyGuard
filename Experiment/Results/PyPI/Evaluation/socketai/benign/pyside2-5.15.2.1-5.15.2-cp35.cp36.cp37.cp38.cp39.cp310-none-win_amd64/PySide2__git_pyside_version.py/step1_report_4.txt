{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define version information for the Qt for Python package, formatted for use by build systems like CMake.",
  "sources": "The version variables (major_version, minor_version, patch_version, release_version_type, pre_release_version) are set within the script.",
  "sinks": "The only output is a print statement formatting the version information; no data sinks or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Variables are assigned values; the print statement outputs these values formatted as a string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward, static, and does not interact with untrusted data.",
  "analysis": "The script simply sets static version-related variables and outputs them in a formatted string when executed as the main module. It is intended for build configuration purposes. There are no indications of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or external data handling. The licensing comments at the beginning do not impact security analysis. Overall, the script is benign and solely for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version information script used in build processes. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security risks. It is purely for defining and outputting version details.",
