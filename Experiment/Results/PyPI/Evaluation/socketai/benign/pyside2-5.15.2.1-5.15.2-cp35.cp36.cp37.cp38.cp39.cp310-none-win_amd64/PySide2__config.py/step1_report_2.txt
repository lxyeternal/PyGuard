  "purpose": "Define module names, version information, and build date metadata for a software package.",
  "sources": "String splitting operation to generate module list; assignments for version and build date variables.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes to external systems, files, or network sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; variables are assigned static strings or lists.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. The module list is static and predefined.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a list of module names by splitting a hardcoded string, assigns version info as strings and tuples, and sets a build date timestamp. There are no inputs from external sources, user inputs, or dynamic code execution. All variables are statically assigned, and there are no suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward configuration or metadata setup for a Python package, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
