  "purpose": "Static configuration data defining module list, version info, and build date for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string split into module names, static version and build date variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static data assignment without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static string splitting to generate a list of module names, along with fixed version and build date variables. There are no dynamic operations, external inputs, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is typical for package metadata setup, with no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or security risks. All signals indicate benign static configuration data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static configuration snippet with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are accurate and justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
