{
  "purpose": "Defines and initializes module-related variables and lists for a Python package, specifically related to Qt modules and version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings to create a list of module names and assigns version and date information from hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "There are no external inputs, user inputs, or untrusted data sources that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The code simply assigns hardcoded values to variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. All variables are initialized with static, hardcoded data; no dynamic code execution or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a list of module names from a static string, assigns version information and build date as constants. There are no external inputs, no file operations, network communications, or dynamic execution. All data is hardcoded and standard for package versioning and module listing, indicating typical package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard package metadata initialization with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any unsafe operations or handle untrusted data. The code appears safe.",
