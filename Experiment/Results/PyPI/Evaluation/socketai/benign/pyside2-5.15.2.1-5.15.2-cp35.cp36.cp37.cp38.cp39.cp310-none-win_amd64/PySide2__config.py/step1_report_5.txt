  "purpose": "Define a list of Qt module names and specify version information for a software package.",
  "sources": "String of module names split by ';', hardcoded version strings, and build date.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data inputs or outputs observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment and string operations only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated elements, or suspicious constructs detected. All variables are assigned static values; no dynamic code execution, environment variables, or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code simply initializes a list of Qt modules from a hardcoded string, sets version variables, and records a build date—all static and straightforward. No user input, external data, or sensitive information is processed or transmitted. No indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. The code appears to be a typical configuration or metadata setup for a package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard package configuration tasks without any malicious intent or security risks.",
