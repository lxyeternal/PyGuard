  "purpose": "Define a list of built-in module names, set version information, and specify build date and package version for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "String literals for module names, version strings, build date, and package version variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources, no data leaks, or dangerous operations identified.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment of known values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures; the code is straightforward configuration data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of module names, version variables, and build date information through static assignments. There are no external inputs, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious operations. The data appears to be hardcoded configuration data typical for package metadata. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration setup with static data for a Python package. It poses no security risks, contains no malicious behavior, and appears to be legitimate package metadata. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
