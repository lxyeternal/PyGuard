  "purpose": "Define module names, library versions, and build date for a Python package related to Qt bindings.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string with module names, hardcoded version strings, and build date assignment.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, no untrusted data handling or network interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; data is statically defined.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a list of module names by splitting a hardcoded string, assigns version information and build date as static strings. All data is hardcoded and does not involve external inputs or untrusted sources. There are no functions, network operations, file operations, or cryptographic functions. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward static configuration snippet defining module names and version info. It does not contain any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
