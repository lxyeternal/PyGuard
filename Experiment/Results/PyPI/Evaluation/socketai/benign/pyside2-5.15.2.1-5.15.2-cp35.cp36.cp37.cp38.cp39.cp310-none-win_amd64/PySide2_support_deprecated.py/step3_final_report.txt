{
  "purpose": "This code manages deprecation warnings for Qt Python bindings by replacing deprecated methods with new ones and issuing warnings to inform users about upcoming removals, ensuring backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes such as __class__, __qualname__, and module dictionaries, particularly inspecting classes in the QtGui module with names starting with 'QMatrix' and a 'data' attribute.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies class attributes in memory (assigning constData to classes) and issues warnings via the warnings module; no external data or untrusted input is involved.",
  "flows": "The function constData is called when a deprecated method is invoked, issuing a warning and returning class data; fix_for_QtGui patches classes by assigning constData to their namespace, affecting subsequent calls to the deprecated method.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward attribute replacement and warning issuance without obfuscation, hidden logic, or suspicious patterns. No external data handling or network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom warning class and a function constData that issues a deprecation warning and returns class data. The fix_for_QtGui function iterates over classes in the QtGui module, replacing or assigning the constData method to classes whose names start with 'QMatrix' and have a 'data' attribute. The overall purpose is to inform users about deprecated methods and maintain backward compatibility. The code uses standard Python practices, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It only modifies class attributes and issues warnings, which are benign actions for deprecation management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for handling deprecated methods in Qt Python bindings. It issues warnings and patches class methods for backward compatibility without any malicious intent or security concerns. All assessments correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and risk score of 0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
