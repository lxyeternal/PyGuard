{
  "purpose": "This module provides deprecated functions and warning mechanisms for a Python interface related to Qt, aiming to maintain backward compatibility and inform users of deprecations.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only defines functions, classes, and warnings.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling a deprecated method which issues a warning and returns class data; there are no external data flows or influence on untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The code uses standard Python practices for deprecation warnings, function definitions, and class attribute modifications. It is well-structured and lacks suspicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom warning class and a function that emits a deprecation warning when invoked, advising users to switch from 'constData' to 'data'. It also modifies classes in a provided QtGui module to replace 'constData' with 'data' and issues a warning upon usage. There is no evidence of malicious code, external data handling, or obfuscated logic. The code is straightforward and primarily serves backward compatibility and deprecation notifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, focusing on deprecation warnings and class attribute replacements for backward compatibility. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are detected.",
