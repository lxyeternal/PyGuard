{
  "purpose": "This module manages deprecation warnings and method replacements for Qt classes in a Python interface, specifically handling legacy method names.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines functions and a class warning for internal use.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to or influence external data or system state; it only issues warnings and modifies class attributes in memory.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow occurs; the functions modify class attributes in memory and issue warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, using warnings and method replacement.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom warning class and a function to replace deprecated method names with updated ones for Qt classes. It issues a deprecation warning when 'constData' is called, advising users to switch to 'data'. The 'fix_for_QtGui' function modifies class attributes to include the new method. No external data, malicious code, or obfuscation is present. The code’s purpose is to aid in transition and deprecation management, not to perform any malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign deprecation utility that modifies class methods and issues warnings for deprecated methods. It does not contain malware or security risks. Overall, it is safe and intended for internal API management.",
