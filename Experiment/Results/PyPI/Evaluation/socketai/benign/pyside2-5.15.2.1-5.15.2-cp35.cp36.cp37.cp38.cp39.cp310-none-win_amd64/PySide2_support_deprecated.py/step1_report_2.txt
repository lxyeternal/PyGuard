{
  "purpose": "Provide deprecation warnings and backward compatibility functions for Qt Python bindings, specifically for QtGui modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads module attributes, class attributes, and constructs warning messages.",
  "sinks": "Warning function calls that may log or output warnings to the user; no data is written or transmitted outside the process.",
  "flows": "Reading class and module attributes (sources) leads to warning calls (sinks) when deprecated methods are used.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code primarily manages deprecation warnings and method replacements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports warnings and textwrap, defines a custom warning class, and implements functions to issue deprecation warnings for certain methods (constData). It also modifies QtGui classes by adding or replacing methods to ensure backward compatibility. The warning messages inform users about deprecated methods. The logic is straightforward and centered around warnings and method replacement, with no external data handling or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for handling deprecated Qt interface methods, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply manages backward compatibility and user warnings.",
