  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured utility for generating .pyi stub files for PySide modules. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The subprocess execution step, while slightly elevating the risk score, is standard for syntax validation and safe given the context. The overall security risk is very low, and the code is safe for use."
