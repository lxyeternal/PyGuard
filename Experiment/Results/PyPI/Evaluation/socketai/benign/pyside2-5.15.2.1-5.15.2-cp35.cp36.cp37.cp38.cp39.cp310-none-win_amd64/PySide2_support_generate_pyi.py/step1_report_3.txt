{
  "purpose": "The script generates .pyi stub files for all PySide modules to facilitate type hinting and static analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads the script file itself for license text; imports from __main__; reads environment variables; reads the list of modules to process; reads from sys.path and environment variables for module import paths.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to files specified by --outpath; writes formatted signatures and import statements; executes subprocesses for syntax validation.",
  "flows": "Reads source/license text and environment variables as input; processes module imports; writes formatted output to .pyi files; runs subprocess to check syntax.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious hardcoded secrets are present. The code is mainly structured for documentation and code generation; no obfuscated code features are visible. Uses environment variables but safely for configuration, not for malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward script for generating .pyi files from PySide modules. It imports modules dynamically, reads license info, and outputs formatted signature information. No external data inputs or untrusted sources are used that could lead to data leakage or injection. The subprocess call checks syntax but does not execute untrusted code. The environment variables are used for configuration only. The code does not perform network activity, system modification, or any harmful actions. It appears to be a legitimate code generation utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign utility for generating type stub files for PySide modules. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The use of environment variables and dynamic imports is standard for such tools. Overall, it is safe and aligns with legitimate development workflows.",
