  "purpose": "This code implements a PySide2 GUI tutorial demonstrating signal-slot communication with a custom LCD range widget, a cannon angle widget, and a control button.",
  "sources": "User input via slider, button clicks, and internal widget signals (valueChanged, angleChanged).",
  "sinks": "Display updates on LCD, background painting, and application quit command.",
  "flows": "Slider valueChanged signal updates LCD display; angleChanged signal updates cannon widget; button click triggers application quit.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated QtCore.SIGNAL and SLOT syntax; no external data sources or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward GUI example with signal-slot connections, custom painting, and user interaction. No external data, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The deprecated syntax is an outdated practice but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, educational GUI demonstration with no security risks or malicious intent. The use of deprecated syntax does not introduce security vulnerabilities but should be updated for modern standards. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1 due to outdated syntax, which is not a security concern.",
