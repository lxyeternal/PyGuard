{
  "purpose": "A simple PySide2 GUI application that creates and displays a 'Hello world!' button window.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Calls app.exec_() to start the Qt event loop; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "sys.argv -> QApplication -> app.exec_() (main event loop).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard GUI code with no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, initializes a QApplication instance with command-line args, creates a QPushButton, displays it, and runs the Qt event loop. There are no suspicious or malicious elements, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data leaks. The use of sys.argv is standard for command-line argument parsing but does not process untrusted data maliciously. The code is straightforward and aligns with common tutorial examples.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard PySide2 tutorial example for creating a simple GUI application. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and poses no security risks.",
