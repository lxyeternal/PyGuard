  "purpose": "Create a simple graphical user interface with a button labeled 'Hello world!' using PySide2.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), import of sys and PySide2 modules.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit(app.exec_()) (executes the application event loop and exits), which is a standard operation.",
  "flows": "sys.argv -> QApplication, user interaction with the button, app.exec_() to run event loop.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; standard GUI creation and event handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, creates a QApplication instance, adds a QPushButton widget, resizes and displays it, then starts the application event loop and exits. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be a basic tutorial example with no malicious intent or malicious code structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward example of a PySide2 GUI application with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for educational purposes.",
