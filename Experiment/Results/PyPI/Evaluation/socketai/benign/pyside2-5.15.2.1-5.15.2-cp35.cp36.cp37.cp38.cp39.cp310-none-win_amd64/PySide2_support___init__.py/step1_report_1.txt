  "purpose": "This code appears to be a licensing header and an import statement for a Python module related to Qt for Python bindings.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the import statement `from shiboken2 import VoidPtr`.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no data outputs, network calls, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code simply imports a module without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only licensing comments and a single import statement with no other logic. No suspicious or unusual code structures, hidden code, or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The file is purely a license header followed by a single import statement. There are no input sources, no data handling, no output or sink functions, and no suspicious code behaviors. The import is standard for working with Qt for Python and does not indicate malicious intent. The file contains no executable logic or data flows that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard license header with a simple import statement for a Qt binding module. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies present. It appears to be a legitimate, benign part of a larger project.",
