  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Anomalies:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of licensing comments and a single import statement (`from shiboken2 import VoidPtr`).\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious behaviors.\n   - The import is from a well-known library (`shiboken2`) used in Qt for Python bindings, which is standard and benign.\n\n2. **Data Flows and Sinks:**\n   - No data input, output, or processing occurs.\n   - No network calls, file operations, or system modifications are present.\n   - The code does not handle untrusted data or perform any dynamic actions.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely licensing information plus an import statement.\n   - No logical flaws or security issues are present.\n\n4. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated score: 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Security risk: 0, as there is no executable or dynamic code.\n   - Confidence levels are high, reflecting the clear benign nature.\n\n5. **Potential for Supply Chain Attacks:**\n   - The import of `VoidPtr` from `shiboken2` is standard and does not suggest malicious intent.\n   - No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- The code is benign, purely licensing metadata, and a standard import.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n- The overall security posture of this code snippet is safe.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No security concerns or malicious activity are associated with this code. It is a typical licensing header with a harmless import statement.",
