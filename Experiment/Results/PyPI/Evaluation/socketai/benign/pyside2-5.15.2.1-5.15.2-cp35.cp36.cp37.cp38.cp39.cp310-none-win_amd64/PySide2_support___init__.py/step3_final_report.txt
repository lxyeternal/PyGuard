  "purpose": "Licensing information and a benign import statement from a well-known library used in Qt for Python bindings.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from shiboken2 import VoidPtr'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only contains static comments and a single import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; licensing comments and a standard import without obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a licensing header with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. The import from 'shiboken2' is standard and benign. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The import is from a legitimate library, and the licensing comments are standard. No changes are necessary; the code poses no threat.",
