  "purpose": "Provides CRC16 checksum calculation using a precomputed lookup table for the XModem variant.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'data' (bytes input), static lookup table 'CRC16_XMODEM_TABLE'.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data output or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data bytes are processed sequentially, with each byte influencing the CRC via table lookup, resulting in a final checksum value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with clear documentation and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard CRC16 checksum calculation using a static lookup table generated by a reputable tool. It reads input bytes, updates the CRC using a common table-driven algorithm, and returns the checksum. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The functions are simple, well-documented, and serve a utility purpose for data integrity verification. The code does not perform any network operations, handle secrets, or execute dynamic code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard CRC16 checksum utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are accurate, and the code can be considered safe for use.",
