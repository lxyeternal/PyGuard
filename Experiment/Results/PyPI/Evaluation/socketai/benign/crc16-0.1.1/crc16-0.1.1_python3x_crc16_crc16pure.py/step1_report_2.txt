{
  "purpose": "Library for calculating CRC16 checksums, specifically the XMODEM variant, for data integrity verification.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters in the functions `crc16xmodem` and `_crc16`. No external sources or user input is read directly in the code.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the checksum as an integer return value. No data is written to files, network, or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data (bytes) is processed in `_crc16`, which uses a lookup table to compute CRC. The output is a checksum value returned by `crc16xmodem`.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. The lookup table was generated by a standard tool and is hardcoded in the script. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script implements a straightforward CRC16 calculation using a predefined lookup table, with functions properly parameterized and documented. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a benign utility for checksum calculation, with license comments and standard implementation practices. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CRC16 checksum library without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any obfuscation or malware. Its purpose is clear and safe for use.",
