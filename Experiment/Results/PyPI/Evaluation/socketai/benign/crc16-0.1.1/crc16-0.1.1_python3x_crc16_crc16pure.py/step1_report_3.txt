  "purpose": "Library for calculating CRC16 checksums, specifically CRC-CCITT (XModem) variant, for data integrity verification.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameter `data` in functions `crc16xmodem` and `_crc16`.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not send data over network, write to files, or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameter `data` into `_crc16`, which processes it using the CRC table and returns the checksum.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CRC16 calculation implementation using a precomputed lookup table, with no obfuscated or malicious elements. The functions process input data to produce a checksum without side effects. The use of a publicly available table and simple calculation indicates typical utility code. No suspicious code patterns, no network activity, and no credential or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CRC checksum library with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves a utility purpose for data integrity verification without involving external interactions or secrets.",
