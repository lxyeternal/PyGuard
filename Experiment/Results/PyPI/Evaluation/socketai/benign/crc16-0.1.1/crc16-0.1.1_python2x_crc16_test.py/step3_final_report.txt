  "purpose": "Unit test suite for CRC16 checksum functions, verifying correctness of implementations.",
  "sources": "Static test data within the test methods, no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Input data fed into checksum functions, assertions verify expected outputs; no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward test code with clear structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports CRC16 checksum modules and runs a series of assertions on known input-output pairs, testing different implementations. It contains no external data handling, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The test data is static, and the code structure is standard for unit tests. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test suite for CRC16 checksum functions with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate safe, straightforward testing code.",
