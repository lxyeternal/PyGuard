{
  "purpose": "Library for calculating CRC16 checksums, specifically the CRC-CCITT (XModem) variant, for data integrity verification.",
  "sources": "Reads input data via the 'data' parameter in functions, which is expected to be a string.",
  "sinks": "Performs checksum calculations internally; no external data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameter 'data' through the '_crc16' function, which processes each byte using a lookup table to compute the CRC.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code adheres to standard CRC calculation logic and licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CRC table generated by a known tool and implements functions to compute CRC16 (XModem variant). There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The license and documentation are clear and consistent. The data input handling is straightforward, and the checksum calculation is standard. No anomalies or suspicious modifications observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-documented CRC16 checksum library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard checksum calculations without any suspicious behavior.",
