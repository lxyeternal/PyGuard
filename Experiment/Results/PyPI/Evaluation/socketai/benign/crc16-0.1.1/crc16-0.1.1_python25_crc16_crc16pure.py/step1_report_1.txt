{
  "purpose": "Library for calculating CRC16 checksum using the XModem variant, for data integrity verification.",
  "sources": "Reads data input via the 'data' parameter in functions 'crc16xmodem' and internal '_crc16' function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is sent to external systems, files, or network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameter 'data' into the '_crc16' function, which processes each byte to produce the CRC value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward CRC calculation with a predefined lookup table. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CRC16 implementation with a precomputed table, functions to compute CRC over input data, and no external or suspicious behavior. It does not include any network operations, file I/O, or environment variable access. The licensing information is benign. No signs of malicious code or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, benign CRC16 checksum library with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard checksum calculations for data integrity purposes.",
