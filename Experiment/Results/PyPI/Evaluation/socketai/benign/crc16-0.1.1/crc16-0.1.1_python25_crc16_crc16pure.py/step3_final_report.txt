  "purpose": "Calculate CRC16 (XModem variant) checksum for input data using a precomputed lookup table.",
  "sources": "Input data string provided to crc16xmodem function.",
  "sinks": "Processed internally within the function; no external sinks or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input string through _crc16 function, which iterates over each byte, updating the CRC value using the lookup table, and returns the final CRC.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, well-documented, and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard CRC16 checksum calculation with a precomputed table generated by a known tool. It processes input data strings without external dependencies, network activity, or obfuscation. The functions are simple and deterministic. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is typical for checksum calculations and aligns with best practices. No vulnerabilities or malicious intents are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CRC16 checksum implementation with no malicious or suspicious features. It is safe for use in security-sensitive applications. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 reflects a conservative stance but is justified given the code's benign nature.",
