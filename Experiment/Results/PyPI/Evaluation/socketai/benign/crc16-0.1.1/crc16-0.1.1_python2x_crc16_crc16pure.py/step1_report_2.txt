{
  "purpose": "A Python library for calculating CRC16 checksums, specifically implementing the XModem variant.",
  "sources": "Reads input data through the 'data' parameter in functions, which is user-provided or external data; no direct file or network input observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code computes CRC values and returns them without performing actions like network communication or file modification.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the 'data' parameter into the '_crc16' function, which processes each byte to produce a checksum; no external data sinks or side effects observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code strictly implements a CRC calculation algorithm. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of CRC16 calculation, using a precomputed lookup table and standard bitwise operations. No external network calls, file I/O, or dynamic code execution found. The functions are well-commented and serve a single purpose, with no signs of malicious intent. The license is open-source, and the logic is standard for checksum calculations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CRC16 checksum implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It functions solely to compute checksums and does not contain any malicious payloads or backdoors.",
