{
  "purpose": "Library for calculating CRC16 checksums using a table-driven algorithm, specifically implementing the CRC-CCITT (XModem) variant.",
  "sources": "Reads input data in the form of a string (via the 'data' parameter in functions). No external data sources or inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data beyond standard checksum calculations. No data leaks or system effects observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameter 'data' through the '_crc16' function, which processes each byte to compute the CRC checksum using the lookup table.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward; no suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code identified.",
  "analysis": "The script contains licensing information, a CRC lookup table generated via a known tool, and functions to perform CRC calculations. The core functions process input data for checksum purposes only, with no network, file, or system command interactions. Usage is limited to checksum calculation. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code is well-structured and documented, with no anomalies or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of CRC16 checksum calculation with no malicious intent. It performs standard checksum operations using a precomputed table, with no indication of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
