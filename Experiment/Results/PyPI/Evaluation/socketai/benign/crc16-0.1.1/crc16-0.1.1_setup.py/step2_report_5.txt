  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No suspicious behaviors, external data handling, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The code reads a local README.txt file, determines Python version, and calls setup() with static and derived parameters.\n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with their conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code is present and matches the description.\n- **Functionality:** It performs typical package setup tasks.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malicious code, external network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None identified.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and thorough; no logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n- The high confidence scores (1) are justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The analysis correctly dismisses any potential vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a typical, benign setup script.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior detected.\n- The detailed reasoning and evidence support the conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, with scores reflecting that. No adjustments needed.",
