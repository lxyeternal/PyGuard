  "purpose": "Setup script for the crc16 Python library, used to configure package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.txt file for long_description; reads Python version info from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to potential data leaks or malicious effects; no external data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and README content, then passes data into the setup() function, which configures package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: it determines the Python version to set a package directory, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata. It imports necessary modules, reads version info safely, and loads a local README file. No code injection, no external network activity, no malicious logic detected. The use of open() on a local file is typical for setup scripts and does not pose a security risk. No anomalies or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
