  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the crc16 Python package, establishing package metadata and extension modules.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.txt file, determines Python version info from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only static package setup operations.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> sets package parameters -> calls setup() with static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script. It reads a local README.txt file, detects Python version to determine package directory, and invokes setup() with static metadata and a C extension. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The script is well-structured, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The file reading operation could be improved with a context manager, but this does not impact security. The version detection logic is standard and correct. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
