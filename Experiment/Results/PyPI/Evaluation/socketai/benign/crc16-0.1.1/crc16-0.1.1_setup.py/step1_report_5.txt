{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the crc16 library, used to install and configure the package.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.txt file, retrieving Python version info from sys.version_info, and importing setup, Extension, os, sys modules.",
  "sinks": "Opening and reading the README.txt file, accessing environment via sys, and calling setup with package metadata and extensions.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info is used to determine baseVersion; README.txt content is read into long_description; setup() function is called with package info, including the extension source.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup script with version-based package directory selection and reading a README file.",
  "analysis": "The script correctly sets up package metadata and sources, uses standard Python modules and practices. No hardcoded secrets, no network connections, nor code that could be malicious or maliciously disguised. The use of sys.version_info to select package directories is standard. The code reads a README.txt file, but no data leaks or external network activity occurs. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It performs standard package configuration tasks securely.",
