  "purpose": "Setup script for the crc16 library to configure package installation",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.txt' file for long description, gathers system version info from sys and os modules, static data for package metadata",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static code executes setup functions with predefined data",
  "flows": "Reads README file -> passes data to setup() -> installs package with specified parameters",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard setup script with no obfuscated or malicious code segments",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks: determining Python version to set base directory, reading a README file for long description, and configuring package metadata for distribution. It imports standard modules, uses static data, and does not execute or evaluate untrusted input. No backdoors, code injections, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The only file read is a local README.txt, which is expected. No network activity or sensitive data handling is involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, legitimate package configuration file.",
