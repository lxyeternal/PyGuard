{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for building and installing the crc16 Python library package, including C extensions.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.txt file for long_description; obtaining version info from sys.version_info; importing setup, Extension from distutils.core; importing os and sys modules.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code does not process untrusted input or perform any output operations that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The script reads version info from sys, reads a local file (README.txt), and invokes setup with static parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets beyond standard package metadata, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup routine. It dynamically determines the Python version to set the package directory, reads a README file for long description, and configures package metadata including extension modules. All operations involve local file access and static metadata; no external data input or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious code or malicious behavior. It reads local files and defines package configuration without any suspicious or malicious logic.",
