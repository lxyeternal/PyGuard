  "purpose": "Library for calculating CRC16 checksums, providing a fallback from a possibly faster implementation to a pure Python version if the C extension is unavailable.",
  "sources": "Attempt to import '_crc16' C extension module; fallback to 'crc16pure' Python module.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external communication within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import attempt from '_crc16' (source) to fallback 'crc16pure' (sink), depending on import success.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard for conditional module import with fallback.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module header with licensing information and a try-except block to import an optional C extension for performance. If the import fails, it defaults to a Python implementation. There are no suspicious functions, data handling, or behavior. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated logic are present. The structure is straightforward and consistent with legitimate open-source libraries.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign library component that conditionally imports an extension module for CRC16 calculations. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior and poses no security threat.",
