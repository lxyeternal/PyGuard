  "purpose": "Library for calculating CRC16 checksums, providing a fallback implementation if a faster one is unavailable.",
  "sources": "Import statement attempting to load '_crc16' or 'crc16pure' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process untrusted data or output data.",
  "flows": "Attempted import of a module (_crc16), fallback to another module (crc16pure). No data flow beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "Simple import logic with fallback, no anomalies or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard header with licensing information, followed by an import attempt for a CRC16 implementation. It tries to import a presumably faster implementation '_crc16' and falls back to 'crc16pure' if the first is unavailable. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior. It strictly performs module imports for checksum calculations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CRC16 library with a common fallback pattern. No malicious behavior, no malicious payload, and no security risks identified.",
