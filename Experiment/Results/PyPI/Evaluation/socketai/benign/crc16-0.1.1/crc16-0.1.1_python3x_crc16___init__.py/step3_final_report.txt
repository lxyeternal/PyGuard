  "purpose": "Import CRC16 implementation, preferring a fast C extension with a fallback to a pure Python version if unavailable.",
  "sources": "Import statement attempting to load '_crc16' or 'crc16pure' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only performs module imports.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import '_crc16'; if fails, import 'crc16pure'.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard import fallback pattern with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a common pattern to optimize performance by importing a C extension for CRC16 calculation, with a fallback to a pure Python implementation. It contains no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The licensing comments are standard. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The import fallback is a benign, well-understood pattern. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's benign and straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe import fallback pattern for a CRC16 checksum library, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
