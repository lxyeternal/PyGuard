{
  "purpose": "Library for calculating CRC16 checksums, providing an import mechanism to select between fast and pure Python implementations.",
  "sources": "Attempted import of internal modules ._crc16 or .crc16pure",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output functions present; mainly imports",
  "flows": "Import attempt from ._crc16 or .crc16pure modules; fallback if ImportError occurs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard licensing comment, straightforward import logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports either a fast or pure Python implementation of CRC16 calculation depending on availability. No user input handling, no data output, no environment variables, or external communication observed. The import structure is standard, and there is no obfuscation or suspicious activity. The licensing comment is normal for open-source code. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious code execution pathways are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, legitimate module loader for CRC16 functionality with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard open-source practices with no suspicious behavior detected.",
