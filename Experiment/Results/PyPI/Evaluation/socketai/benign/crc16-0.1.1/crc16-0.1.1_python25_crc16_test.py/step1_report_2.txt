  "purpose": "Unit tests for CRC16 XModem checksum implementations in different modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'crc16', '_crc16', and 'crc16pure'; use of input data in test cases.",
  "sinks": "Assertions on checksum values; no data sinks that could leak or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Input data strings are processed by CRC functions; no data flows to external systems or insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No unusual language features or obfuscation. Test code is standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports CRC calculation modules and defines a test class with multiple test cases verifying CRC calculations on various data inputs. The tests validate the correctness of checksum outputs using known values. No network activity, file operations, or environment variable usage are present. No suspicious or malicious logic, code injection, or privacy violations are detected. The code appears solely for testing the CRC implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard unit test suite for CRC checksum functions, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It contains no malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It is safe and intended for correctness verification.",
