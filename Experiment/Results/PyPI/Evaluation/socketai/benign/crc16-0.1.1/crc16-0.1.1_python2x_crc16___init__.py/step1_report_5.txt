{
  "purpose": "Library for calculating CRC16 checksum, providing a fallback implementation if a faster version is unavailable.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._crc16 and .crc16pure.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; only importing modules.",
  "flows": "Import attempt from ._crc16, fallback to .crc16pure if ImportError occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import logic, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import structure with a try-except block to select between a fast and a pure Python implementation of CRC16. It does not process data directly, does not read external input, nor contains code that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is clean, with standard licensing comments and a fallback import strategy.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign library setup for CRC16 calculation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs module imports in a typical manner, with no suspicious logic or hidden behaviors.",
