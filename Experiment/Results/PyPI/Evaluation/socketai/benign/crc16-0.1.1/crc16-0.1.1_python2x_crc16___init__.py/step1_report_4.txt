{
  "purpose": "Library for calculating CRC16 checksums, providing either a fast implementation or a pure Python fallback.",
  "sources": "Imports of internal modules: ._crc16 and .crc16pure.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only performs module imports and conditional logic.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code attempts to import modules conditionally based on availability.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code behavior, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard library setup that tries to import a fast CRC16 implementation, falling back to a pure Python version if needed. It contains licensing comments and handles import errors gracefully. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The code is straightforward and consistent with common Python package patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup for CRC16 calculations, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
