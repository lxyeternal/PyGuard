  "purpose": "Library for calculating CRC16 checksums, providing both a fast implementation and a pure Python fallback.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '_crc16' and 'crc16pure' based on availability.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external network interactions present.",
  "flows": "Conditional import flow: attempts to import '_crc16' and falls back to 'crc16pure' if the import fails.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import logic, no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a fast CRC16 implementation and falls back to a pure Python version if the first import fails. It includes licensing comments and error handling for import failure, but no data manipulation, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard implementation of a CRC16 checksum library with fallback logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
