  "purpose": "Library for calculating CRC16 checksums, with an attempt to import a faster implementation if available, otherwise falling back to a pure Python version.",
  "sources": "Attempt to import from ._crc16 and fallback to .crc16pure.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations; the code only performs module imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily import logic.",
  "anomalies": "None; no unusual or suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple library setup with a try-except block to import optimized code if available. It handles import fallback cleanly, with no input/output, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The licensing comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign library setup for CRC16 checksum calculations. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
