  "purpose": "A simple module to import CRC16 implementation, with fallback to a pure Python version if the fast implementation is unavailable.",
  "sources": "Import statements for '_crc16' and 'crc16pure' modules, which are internal dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; the code only performs module imports.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import '_crc16'; if it fails, import 'crc16pure'. No data flow beyond import logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious behaviors; standard fallback pattern and licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for optional fast implementation import with fallback. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The fallback mechanism is common and not suspicious. The licensing comments are standard. No anomalies or malicious code detected. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe import fallback pattern with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are justified.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
