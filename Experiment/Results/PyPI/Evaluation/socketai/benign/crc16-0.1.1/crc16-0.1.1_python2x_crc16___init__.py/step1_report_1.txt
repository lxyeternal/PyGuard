{
  "purpose": "Library for calculating CRC16 checksums, providing both fast and pure Python implementations.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules '_crc16' and 'crc16pure'. No external data inputs or user input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; no external network, file, or environment variable interactions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only handles module imports internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. Import fallback mechanism is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a fast CRC16 implementation and falls back to a pure Python version if the import fails. The licensing information is standard and provides no malicious indicators. There are no external data inputs, no code execution, or other suspicious activities. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python library setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard library setup for CRC16 calculations with a fallback import. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The code is safe and legitimate.",
