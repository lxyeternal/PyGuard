  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the original code to verify the claims, assess the scores, and ensure consistency.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is a straightforward import setup with no data processing, network activity, or other suspicious behavior.\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only performs import statements with fallback logic and no malicious activity.\n   - No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly state that the code is benign, standard, and does not contain malicious patterns.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0`, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, consistent with the straightforward import logic.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5; all are 0.\n   - This is justified because the code does not perform any risky operations or contain malicious code.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware: 0`.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, so this score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a benign import fallback.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- While the code itself is benign, the presence of internal modules (`_crc16` and `crc16pure`) could, in theory, be scrutinized if their contents were malicious. However, based solely on this import structure, there is no evidence of malicious intent.\n- The fallback mechanism is standard practice and does not indicate obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and well-justified. The code is a typical, safe library setup with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence provided.",
