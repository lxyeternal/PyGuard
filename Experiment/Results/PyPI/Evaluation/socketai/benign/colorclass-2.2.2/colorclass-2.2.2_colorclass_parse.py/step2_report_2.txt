  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and underlying logic.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code parses ANSI color sequences, prunes overridden codes, and performs string manipulations. No malicious behavior or suspicious external activity is detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a typical ANSI parser with no signs of malicious intent. The low security risk score is appropriate. The malware score is correctly set to 0, given no malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard ANSI processing with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's purpose. Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2) is acceptable given the regex manipulations, but still low. Malware remains at 0, which is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on parsing and managing ANSI sequences, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** The code's functions are standard for terminal color handling. No external calls or suspicious patterns. The scores align with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar ANSI processing, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** High confidence and zero security risk are justified. The malware score is correctly zero.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard ANSI sequence handling with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's functionality.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low across all reports, justified by the absence of external calls, secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9 or 1.0), justified by the consistent analysis.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a legitimate ANSI parsing utility with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal but non-zero residual risk due to regex complexity, but practically negligible)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior. The current scoring aligns well with the analysis.",
