{
  "purpose": "Provides mapping between color names and ANSI escape codes for terminal styling, including auto color selection based on background brightness.",
  "sources": "Reads input through the 'value_markup' string parameter in the constructor; accesses system I/O status via sys.stdout.isatty() and sys.stderr.isatty().",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data is sent over network, written to files, or executed as code.",
  "flows": "Input string with color tags → __init__ constructs whitelist → __getitem__ retrieves color codes based on whitelist → property methods determine auto colors based on background setting and TTY status.",
  "anomalies": "Uses class variables to toggle color disablement and background brightness; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code patterns. Whitelist filtering based on string matching with '{' + key + '}'.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a mapping class for terminal color codes, allowing dynamic toggling of colors and background brightness. It relies on system TTY status to disable colors when no terminal is attached. It does not include network operations, file manipulations, or code execution. The whitelist is generated based on the presence of color tags in the input markup string, preventing arbitrary key access. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The only minor concern is the use of class variables for global toggles, which are standard practice for such features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of terminal color mapping with dynamic features; it contains no malicious behavior, no backdoors, and no security threats. It is a benign utility for styling terminal output.",
