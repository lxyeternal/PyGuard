  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Mapping color names to ANSI codes, auto color based on background, listing tags.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Input from 'value_markup'; uses sys.stdout/stderr for TTY detection.\n- Anomalies: Uses class variables for global toggles, but this is standard practice.\n- Analysis: No malicious patterns; straightforward implementation.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign utility.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (very low).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar mapping with auto color selection.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Input string and TTY detection.\n- Anomalies: Uses class variables for toggling; no suspicious code.\n- Analysis: No external or malicious activity; standard design.\n- Conclusion: Benign, safe code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Mapping with auto color based on background.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Input string parsing, TTY detection.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code; straightforward.\n- Analysis: No malicious activity; standard pattern.\n- Conclusion: Safe utility.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Color mapping with auto background color selection.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Input markup, TTY detection.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns; standard design.\n- Analysis: No malicious activity; benign.\n- Conclusion: No security concern.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (still very low).\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar color mapping with auto selection.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Input markup, TTY detection.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, code, or backdoors. The code is a standard ANSI color mapping utility.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation patterns detected; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, primarily because the code is benign, with only minimal global toggles that are standard in such utilities.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation patterns)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, related to global toggles but not dangerous)\n\n**Note:** The use of class variables for toggling colors is typical for such utilities and does not pose security risks. No external dependencies or network activity are involved.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a safe, standard implementation of terminal color management with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
