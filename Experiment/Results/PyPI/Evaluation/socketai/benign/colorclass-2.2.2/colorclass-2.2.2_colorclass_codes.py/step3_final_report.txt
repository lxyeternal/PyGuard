  "purpose": "Manage mapping between color names and ANSI codes, supporting auto color selection based on background mode, with functionality to enable/disable colors and list available tags.",
  "sources": "Input string 'value_markup' for whitelist filtering; sys.stdout and sys.stderr for TTY detection.",
  "sinks": "Returns ANSI code integers; no external system calls or data leaks; whitelist filtering prevents arbitrary key access.",
  "flows": "Input markup influences whitelist; methods retrieve color codes based on class variables and background mode; TTY detection toggles color output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of class variables for global toggles is standard; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured utility for terminal color management. It maps color names to ANSI codes, supports auto color selection based on background, and toggles color output based on TTY status. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or external dependencies are present. The whitelist filtering based on 'value_markup' is a common safety measure. Use of class variables for toggling colors is typical but could have side effects in multi-threaded contexts, though this is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for terminal color handling with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily due to global state toggles, which are common in such utilities.",
