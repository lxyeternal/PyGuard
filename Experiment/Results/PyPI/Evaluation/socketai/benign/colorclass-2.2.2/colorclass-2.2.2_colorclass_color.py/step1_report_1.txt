{
  "purpose": "Provide a subclass of ColorStr with convenience methods for coloring text in terminal with various colors and backgrounds.",
  "sources": "The class methods accept input strings, specifically in the 'colorize' method and its wrappers.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the creation of Color instances with formatted color tags. No direct untrusted data output or external calls are evident.",
  "flows": "Input strings are formatted into color tags within 'colorize' and then used to instantiate Color objects; no external or network communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code relies on standard string formatting and method calls. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code detected. The auto parameter simply influences tag construction.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Color subclass with class methods to generate colorized strings using tags. It does not read external input beyond parameters, nor does it perform any output, network communication, or system modification. The methods are straightforward wrappers around string formatting and object instantiation, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a utility for text coloring in terminal outputs and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not pose security risks or facilitate malicious activities.",
