{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to enable, disable, and query terminal color features via the ANSICodeMapping class.",
  "sources": "Calls to ANSICodeMapping methods within each function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; functions invoke methods without processing external input.",
  "flows": "Function calls directly to ANSICodeMapping methods; no complex data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward wrapper functions with clear documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple, direct wrapper functions around the ANSICodeMapping class, serving as an interface for color control in terminal output. No input/output handling, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns are present. The functions do not process untrusted data or perform network operations. The reported malware scores are all zero, aligning with the benign nature of the code. The slight variation in security risk scores (e.g., 0.1 in one report) appears to be an overestimation; given the code's simplicity and reliance on a trusted library, the risk is negligible. Overall, the code is a benign utility with no malicious or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward utility module for terminal color management, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores are appropriate, though the minor security risk score could be uniformly adjusted to 0 for consistency.",
