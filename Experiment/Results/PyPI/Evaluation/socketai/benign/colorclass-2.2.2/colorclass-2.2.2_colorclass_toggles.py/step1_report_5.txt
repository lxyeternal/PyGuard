  "purpose": "Provide convenience functions to enable or disable color features in terminal output using the ANSICodeMapping class.",
  "sources": "Imported from colorclass.codes import ANSICodeMapping",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used or propagated",
  "flows": "Functions call methods on ANSICodeMapping; no external data flows or untrusted input handling",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines wrapper functions around methods of the ANSICodeMapping class to control terminal color display. There are no input sources such as user input, network data, or environment variables. The functions simply invoke class methods for enabling/disabling colors or setting background modes, with no data processing or external interactions. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility module for managing terminal color display features, with no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks identified.",
