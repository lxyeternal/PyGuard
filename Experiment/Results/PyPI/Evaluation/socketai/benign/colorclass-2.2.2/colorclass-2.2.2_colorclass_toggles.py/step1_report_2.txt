{
  "purpose": "Provides convenience functions to enable or disable color features in terminal output using the colorclass library.",
  "sources": "Imports ANSICodeMapping from colorclass.codes, and calls its methods for enabling/disabling colors and setting backgrounds.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input; the code only calls functions within a trusted library to control display features.",
  "flows": "Calls to ANSICodeMapping methods control internal state related to color display; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly provides wrapper functions around the ANSICodeMapping methods for toggling color features. It does not process or handle user input or external data. No data leaks, malicious actions, or suspicious behaviors are apparent. The functions are straightforward and rely on an external library for their operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign, serving as a simple interface to control terminal color output. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks.",
