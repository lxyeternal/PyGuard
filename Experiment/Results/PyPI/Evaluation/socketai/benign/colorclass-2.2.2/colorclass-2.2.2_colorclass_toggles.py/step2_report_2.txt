  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward set of wrapper functions around the `ANSICodeMapping` class from the `colorclass.codes` module.\n- No external inputs, no network activity, no file I/O, and no dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- All reports agree on benign intent and implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description; no issues or anomalies are detected.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None, apart from a very minor security risk score of 0.1 (likely due to reliance on an external library). This is reasonable, as the code itself does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Scores consistency:**\n  - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n  - The `securityRisk` score is 0 or 0.1, which is acceptable given the context.\n  - The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n- **Risk score justification:**\n  - The overall risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1). Given the benign nature, this is appropriate.\n  - No reason to elevate the risk score above 0.5; the minimal security concern is justified by the reliance on an external library, but that does not imply malicious intent.\n\n- **Malware score:**\n  - Correctly set to 0 across all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities:**\n  - All reports correctly identify that the code does not process untrusted data or perform any suspicious operations.\n  - No unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the reports and code:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (appropriate, given the external dependency, but minimal)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code is a benign utility module with no security risks. The minimal risk score reflects reliance on an external library but does not indicate any actual vulnerability or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor security risk score is justified by external dependency reliance but does not pose a real threat.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the scores and conclusions are appropriate.",
