  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code against the claims, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists of simple wrapper functions around the `ANSICodeMapping` class, providing toggle and query functions for terminal color output.\n- No input/output with untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns are present.\n- The functions are straightforward, with clear documentation, and rely on an external trusted library.\n- The reported malware scores are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk scores are minimal, with only one report noting a very low 0.1, which seems to be an overestimation given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Detailed review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; wrapper functions for `ANSICodeMapping`.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Benign, straightforward, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct; same as above.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Benign, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Benign utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Benign, straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Again, benign utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.0 — slightly higher securityRisk score, but still very low.\n\n**Justification for securityRisk=0.1:**  \nGiven the code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious operations, this score appears to be an overestimation. The only reason for a non-zero score might be the reliance on an external library, but since the code merely calls methods without processing untrusted data, the risk remains negligible.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior; thus, malware=0 is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** The majority assign 0, with one at 0.1. Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0.0 would be more appropriate across the board.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward utility wrapper around a trusted library.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The minimal security risk scores should be uniformly set to **0.0** for accuracy and consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|-----------|--------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0         | 0            | 0.0          | No malicious behavior or obfuscation. |\n| 2       | 0         | 0            | 0.0          | Same reasoning. |\n| 3       | 0         | 0            | 0.0          | Benign wrapper functions. |\n| 4       | 0         | 0            | 0.0          | No suspicious activity. |\n| 5       | 0         | 0            | 0.0          | Overestimated risk; no actual security concern. |\n\n**Final note:** The code is safe, and the risk scores should be adjusted downward to reflect the actual low threat level.",
