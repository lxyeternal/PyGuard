{
  "purpose": "Provide convenience functions for enabling/disabling and configuring color output in terminal interfaces.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; functions call methods from ANSICodeMapping, which is imported from a third-party library.",
  "sinks": "Methods of ANSICodeMapping that modify internal state related to color output; no data leaks or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Function calls invoke ANSICodeMapping methods directly, without any processing of untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no apparent malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of wrapper functions calling methods on an imported class ANSICodeMapping. It provides toggles and checks for color settings, which is typical for terminal UI customization. No user input, network activity, or file operations are present. No anomalies or malicious code detected. The functions are straightforward, well-documented, and contain no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as a simple interface for managing terminal color output. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility module.",
