{
  "purpose": "Provide convenience functions to enable, disable, and configure color display features, primarily for terminal output styling.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration and state from the ANSICodeMapping class, such as methods to enable/disable colors and check background settings.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or pass data to external systems or untrusted sources; it primarily calls methods within a class.",
  "flows": "User calls functions like disable_all_colors() or enable_all_colors(), which invoke corresponding methods in ANSICodeMapping, affecting internal state.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic detected. The code uses straightforward method calls without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script consists of simple wrapper functions that invoke methods on the ANSICodeMapping class to toggle or query color display settings. It includes functions to disable all colors, enable colors, conditionally disable based on TTY, and set background brightness preferences. All operations are limited to internal state modifications or queries within the library. There are no input/output operations with untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module that provides interface functions for configuring terminal color output. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The functions are straightforward and limited to internal configuration management.",
