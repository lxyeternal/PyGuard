  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple wrappers around the `ANSICodeMapping` class from `colorclass.codes`.\n- No external input handling, data processing, or network activity is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code's purpose is purely to toggle or query terminal color settings.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, assigning malware scores of 0 and very low security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n- **Code correctness and presence of issues:**  \n  The code matches the description; it is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious logic. No issues are present.\n\n- **Malware or malicious behavior:**  \n  No evidence suggests malicious intent. The code only calls trusted library methods.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  None detected.\n\n- **Security risk:**  \n  The overall risk is minimal, as the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Most reports assign 0 or 0.1, reflecting negligible security risk. The slight variation (0.1) in report 5 is acceptable but perhaps slightly overestimating the risk.\n\n---\n\n### Specific observations:\n\n- **Report 5** assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1, which seems marginally high given the benign nature. Since the code doesn't handle untrusted input or external data, a risk score of 0 is more appropriate.\n\n- **Scores for malware and obfuscation** are consistent across reports and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust the risk score in report 5 to 0** for consistency and accuracy.\n- **No changes needed for malware or obfuscated scores.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Category        | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware         | 0 — no malicious behavior detected                          |\n| obfuscated      | 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation present        |\n| risk            | 0 — no security risk; code is benign utility wrapper       |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign utility module with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The existing scores are appropriate, except for report 5's securityRisk, which should be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis review confirms the code's safety and benign intent. No further security concerns are identified.",
