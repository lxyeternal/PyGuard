{
  "purpose": "Provides convenience functions to enable, disable, and configure color output features via the ANSICodeMapping module.",
  "sources": "Calls to ANSICodeMapping's methods and attributes such as disable_all_colors, enable_all_colors, disable_if_no_tty, and various attribute checks.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of ANSICodeMapping methods which may alter terminal color output; no direct untrusted data input or output streams are involved.",
  "flows": "Function calls invoke ANSICodeMapping methods directly, which manage internal states related to color output; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution. The code relies on an imported module, but does not perform any suspicious operations itself.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward wrapper functions that interface with the ANSICodeMapping module to control color output. There is no input handling, no data processing, and no network activity. All functions appear to be standard feature toggles for terminal display settings. No anomalies, malicious patterns, or obfuscation detected. The code is simple and adheres to expected patterns for such utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of utility functions managing color output states. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It is a typical, safe helper module with no security risks.",
