{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports functions and classes related to color management for console applications across different operating systems.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules from the 'colorclass' package, specifically from 'codes', 'color', 'toggles', and 'windows'.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or sent externally.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions and classes, then exposes them via __all__, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior are present. The code mainly performs imports and exports functions/classes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules from the 'colorclass' library, which is used for console text coloring. It sets __all__ to define exported symbols, and sets metadata attributes. There are no user inputs, external data processing, or network operations. The code appears to be a straightforward module setup for a library without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard library module for managing console text colors, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply exposes functions and classes for use elsewhere.",
