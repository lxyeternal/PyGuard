  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward setup.py script using setuptools.\n- It defines static package metadata, package data, and calls setup() with these parameters.\n- No dynamic code execution, input handling, network operations, or untrusted data processing are present.\n- The long_description is a static string containing documentation, not executable code.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns.\n- The code appears to be a standard, benign package configuration script.\n\n**Specific points per report:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the script as a typical setup.py for packaging.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious intents are detected.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n- The detailed descriptions reinforce that there are no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n\n- The reports are thorough and accurate; they do not overstate potential risks.\n- Since the code is static and solely for package setup, the malware score should remain 0.\n- The obfuscated score is also 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- The risk score is appropriately low, given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard setup.py script with no malicious or suspicious elements. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- Maintain malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- The code is safe and typical for Python package distribution.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security threat. The analysis confirms that the package setup is standard, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
