  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'colorclass' Python package, used for creating colorful console applications with color tagging and ANSI support.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and configuration data for packaging, such as package list, package data, and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "The setup function invocation is a sink for the package metadata. No untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "flows": "The flow is from package metadata definitions to the setup() function call, with no external input or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward package setup logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, defines package data, and invokes setup() with static metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious patterns are detected. The code solely manages package configuration for distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs typical package configuration tasks without anomalies.",
