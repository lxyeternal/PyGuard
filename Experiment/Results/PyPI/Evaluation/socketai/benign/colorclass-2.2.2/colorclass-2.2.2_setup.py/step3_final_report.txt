  "purpose": "Standard package setup script for 'colorclass' library, defining metadata and invoking setup()",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, package_data, and long_description string",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks for malicious payloads",
  "flows": "Static data flows from definitions into setup() call; no dynamic or external data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static configuration with no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python module. It imports setuptools, defines static metadata, package data, and calls setup() with these parameters. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The long_description is a static documentation string, not executable code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this script, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, which are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup.py script for packaging a Python module, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
