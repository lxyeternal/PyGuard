  "purpose": "The script allows the package to be used as a command-line utility for coloring terminal output based on environment variables and input lines.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (COLOR_ENABLE, COLOR_DISABLE, COLOR_LIGHT, COLOR_DARK), standard input (fileinput.input())",
  "sinks": "Printing colored output to the terminal, potentially influenced by environment variables",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence color toggle functions, input lines are read via fileinput, then wrapped in Color objects and printed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No obfuscated code, no external network calls, or malicious system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules for handling color output and environment toggles. It reads environment variables to determine whether to enable or disable color, set light or dark background themes, and applies these settings accordingly. It then reads input lines from stdin and prints them with color formatting. The code does not perform any network activity, file manipulation beyond reading input, or other potentially malicious actions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a terminal colorizer utility controlled via environment variables. It appears benign with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply manipulates terminal output based on user environment settings and input. The overall security risk score is very low.",
