{
  "purpose": "The script provides command-line functionality to apply color formatting to input text, primarily for terminal display purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (COLOR_ENABLE, COLOR_DISABLE, COLOR_LIGHT, COLOR_DARK) and input lines from stdin via fileinput.input().",
  "sinks": "The environment variables influence color settings; the input data is printed with color formatting. No untrusted data is sent elsewhere or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are checked and influence the behavior of color toggles. Input lines are read from stdin and passed to the Color class for processing and output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code relies on standard libraries and predictable external modules. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules for color handling and terminal adjustments. It reads environment variables to toggle color settings, which are standard practices. The input is read line-by-line from stdin and formatted with the Color class before printing. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. Usage of environment variables for configuration is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. The code structure is straightforward, and all operations are related to terminal display enhancements.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a terminal utility for colored output, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It uses standard practices and external modules responsibly.",
