{
  "purpose": "The script enables colorized output in the terminal based on environment variables and user input, functioning as a command-line utility for color formatting.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (COLOR_ENABLE, COLOR_DISABLE, COLOR_LIGHT, COLOR_DARK), user input from stdin via fileinput.input()",
  "sinks": "print() function outputs to stdout; no data leaks or untrusted data manipulation are evident, and no external network connections are made",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> toggle functions (enable_all_colors, disable_all_colors, set_light_background, set_dark_background) -> Color class instantiation -> print output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script reads environment variables to determine display settings, applying corresponding toggle functions. It reads input lines from stdin and prints colorized output using the Color class. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious code present. The logic is standard for a terminal color utility, and no anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign terminal utility for applying color formatting based on environment variables and user input. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
