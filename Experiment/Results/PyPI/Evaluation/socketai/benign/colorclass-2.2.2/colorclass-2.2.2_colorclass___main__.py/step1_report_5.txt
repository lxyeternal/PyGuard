{
  "purpose": "The script enables colored output in the terminal, based on environment variables, and processes input lines to display colored text.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (COLOR_ENABLE, COLOR_DISABLE, COLOR_LIGHT, COLOR_DARK), input lines from stdin",
  "sinks": "print function outputs processed lines, which display colored text",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence toggles (enable/disable colors, set backgrounds) -> input lines are read -> Color object processes lines -> output is printed with colors",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward, using environment variables for configuration, and standard input/output operations.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables to toggle color settings and applies them before processing input lines from stdin. It uses the 'colorclass' library to add color formatting to output. No external network activity, no suspicious code, and no obfuscated segments are present. The code structure is simple and does not include any malicious functions or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign utility for colored terminal output. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It simply configures display settings based on environment variables and processes input lines for colored display.",
