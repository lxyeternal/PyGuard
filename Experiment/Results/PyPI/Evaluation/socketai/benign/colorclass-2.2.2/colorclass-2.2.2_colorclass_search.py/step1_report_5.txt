{
  "purpose": "The code processes ANSI escape sequences to map visible character positions to their corresponding color codes, facilitating the determination of character colors in colored terminal output.",
  "sources": "RE_SPLIT.split(ansi_string) and RE_SPLIT.match(item), which read the input string and parse it into segments, identifying color codes versus visible characters.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used insecurely; the functions primarily parse and process ANSI sequences without external output or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input string is split into segments; color codes are identified and tallied to map positions; find_char_color uses position matching to retrieve color codes associated with a specific character index.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses regex splitting and matching to parse ANSI sequences but does not contain malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or hidden backdoors. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The functions are designed for parsing ANSI escape sequences to determine the color of characters at specific positions. They rely on regex-based splitting and matching, which are standard parsing techniques. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulation, or system commands beyond string processing. It appears to be a legitimate utility for handling terminal color codes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for parsing ANSI escape sequences to map character positions to color codes. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The functions are straightforward and do not contain malicious behavior.",
