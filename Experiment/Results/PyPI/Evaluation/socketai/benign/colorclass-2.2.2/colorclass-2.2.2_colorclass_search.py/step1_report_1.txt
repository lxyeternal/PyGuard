{
  "purpose": "The code processes ANSI escape sequences to map visible characters to their color codes, likely for rendering or analysis of colored terminal output.",
  "sources": "The input string 'ansi_string' read in both 'build_color_index' and 'find_char_color' functions; the 'pos' parameter in 'find_char_color'.",
  "sinks": "The functions process and return color information but do not write or send data externally; no direct data leaks or network transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'ansi_string' is split using RE_SPLIT; color codes are identified as matches, and visible characters are mapped or retrieved based on positions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, such as hidden dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code appears straightforward and aligns with standard ANSI parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes a regex-based splitting to parse ANSI escape sequences, building an index of visible characters relative to color codes, and retrieving color information for characters at specific positions. No external data transmission, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The functions serve legitimate purposes related to ANSI color code parsing. There are no signs of backdoors, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard ANSI parsing utility designed for mapping characters to color codes. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior and poses no evident security risks.",
