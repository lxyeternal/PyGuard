  "sources": "RE_SPLIT regex from colorclass.parse used to split ANSI sequences from text.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; purely string processing functions.",
  "flows": "Splitting input string into tokens, matching ANSI sequences, mapping character positions, and retrieving color codes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ANSI escape sequence parsing using regex splitting and matching. It maps visible characters to their color codes and retrieves color info for specific positions. No external system interactions, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The reliance on an external regex is typical for such parsing tasks. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident. The functions are straightforward and serve a legitimate purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard ANSI parsing utility with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The low security risk scores are justified. No modifications are necessary; it can be considered secure and benign.",
