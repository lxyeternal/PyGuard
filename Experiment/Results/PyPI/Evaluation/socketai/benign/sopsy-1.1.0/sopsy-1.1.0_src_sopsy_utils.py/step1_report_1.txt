  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing SOPS configuration, executing commands, and parsing data in a Python project related to security operations.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration files (find_sops_config), reading text from files (build_config), executing subprocess commands (run_cmd), decoding bytes (get_dict).",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run (executes external commands), reading configuration files from the filesystem, decoding command output (potential data leak), parsing data as JSON or YAML.",
  "flows": "Configuration file discovery and reading -> Merging config dictionaries -> Executing external commands with subprocess -> Parsing command output from bytes to dict or str.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.run with check=True is standard; no dangerous command execution or data handling appears suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The only potential concern is subprocess call with arbitrary command list, but this is typical for command execution.",
  "analysis": "The code handles configuration management, command execution, and data parsing in a structured manner. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious data handling is evident. subprocess.run is used safely with check=True and does not process untrusted input directly, aside from the command list provided by the caller, which is standard practice. No indicators of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are present. Error handling is appropriate and does not involve suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for configuration and command execution with no signs of malicious intent or malware. The use of subprocess is controlled and expected in such contexts. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain risks are evident.",
