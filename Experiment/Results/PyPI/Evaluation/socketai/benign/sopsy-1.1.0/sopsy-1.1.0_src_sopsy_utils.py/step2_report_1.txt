  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**1. Code Review & Logical Analysis:**\n\n- The code consists of utility functions:\n  - `build_config`: merges configuration data from a file and a provided dictionary.\n  - `find_sops_config`: searches for a config file up the directory tree.\n  - `get_dict`: parses data as JSON or YAML.\n  - `run_cmd`: executes external commands via subprocess, optionally parsing output.\n\n- The code uses standard libraries (`json`, `yaml`, `subprocess`, `pathlib`) and custom exceptions.\n\n- The subprocess call uses `subprocess.run` with `check=True`, which is standard and safe if inputs are sanitized.\n\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code constructs are evident.\n\n- Error handling is appropriate, raising custom exceptions on failures.\n\n**2. Potential Concerns & Anomalies:**\n\n- The use of `subprocess.run` with arbitrary command lists could be risky if inputs are untrusted, but the code expects the caller to supply commands. Proper input validation is assumed to be handled elsewhere.\n\n- Merging configurations and reading files are straightforward; no malicious logic is detected.\n\n- No obfuscation, backdoors, or malware signatures are present.\n\n**3. Malware & Obfuscation Scores:**\n\n- The code is transparent, well-structured, and does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n- No obfuscation is present.\n\n- Malware score should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n**4. Security Risk:**\n\n- The main risk is subprocess execution with untrusted input, but since commands are passed as list of strings, and no input sanitization is shown here, the risk is minimal. The reports assign a security risk of 0.1-0.2, which seems reasonable.\n\n**5. Consistency of Report Scores:**\n\n- All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2). This aligns with the code's analysis.\n\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting the reviewers' agreement.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1-0.2** (minimal, typical for utility functions involving subprocess calls)\n\n### Justification:\n\n- The code is standard utility code for configuration management and command execution.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- The subprocess calls are safe assuming inputs are sanitized externally.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type    | Final Score | Justification |\n|---------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Malware       | 0            | No malicious activity detected. |\n| Obfuscated    | 0            | Code is clear and straightforward. |\n| Risk          | 0.1 - 0.2    | Typical utility functions with minimal security considerations. |\n\n**Overall, I agree with the existing report scores.**",
