  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing SOPS configuration files, parsing data, and executing commands related to SOPS encryption/decryption.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration files from filesystem, reading command output from subprocess execution, parsing data from bytes or string input.",
  "sinks": "Reading config files, subprocess command execution, data parsing functions.",
  "flows": "Config files are located and read, data from command output is parsed into dicts, commands are run with input arguments, and outputs are processed depending on flags.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs configuration file discovery, merging configurations, running external subprocess commands, and parsing data into dictionaries. It uses safe libraries (yaml, json) and standard subprocess handling. No input is taken from untrusted sources in a way that could lead to injection; subprocess calls are controlled with command lists. Error handling appears standard. No hardcoded credentials or malicious backdoors are present. No obfuscated code or unusual code constructs are present. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward utility module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility module for managing SOPS configurations, executing commands, and parsing data. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are identified. The code is well-structured and uses safe libraries, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
