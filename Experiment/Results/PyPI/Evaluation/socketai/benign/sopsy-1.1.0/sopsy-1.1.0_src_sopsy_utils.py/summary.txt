  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs standard configuration and command execution tasks without malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified. The only issue is the list merging bug in 'build_config', which should be corrected for proper functionality. Overall, the code is safe and the reports' scores are accurate."
