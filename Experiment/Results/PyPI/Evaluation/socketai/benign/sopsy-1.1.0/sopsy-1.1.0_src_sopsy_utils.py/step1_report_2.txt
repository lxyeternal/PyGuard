  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for managing SOPS configuration files, parsing data, and running SOPS commands.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration files from filesystem, reading command output via subprocess, parsing data from bytes or strings (JSON or YAML).",
  "sinks": "Command execution with subprocess, reading configuration files, parsing data, logging.",
  "flows": "Configuration files are read from filesystem (find_sops_config), data is parsed from strings or bytes (get_dict), subprocess runs commands and processes output (run_cmd).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code constructs. The subprocess command execution is standard but potentially risky if command inputs are untrusted (not evident here). No obfuscation or suspicious data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration management tasks: locating config files, merging configs, parsing data from JSON/YAML, and executing subprocess commands. The subprocess call uses subprocess.run with check=True, which is normal but should be controlled to avoid command injection if inputs are untrusted. However, the commands are passed as list of strings, indicating safe usage assuming inputs are sanitized elsewhere. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is evident. Logging is used for debugging. No hardcoded secrets or data leaks are detected. The functions handle errors properly, raising custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for configuration management, data parsing, and command execution with no signs of malicious intent. It is well-structured, does not contain obfuscated or suspicious logic, and adheres to standard practices. No malware or security threats are identified.",
