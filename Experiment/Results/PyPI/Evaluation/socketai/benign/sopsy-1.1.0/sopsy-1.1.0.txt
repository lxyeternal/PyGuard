The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to temporary file handling, which is standard. The scores and analysis are consistent and appropriate."

The low security risk score is justified. The only issue is the list merging bug in 'build_config', which should be corrected for proper functionality. Overall, the code is safe and the reports' scores are accurate."
