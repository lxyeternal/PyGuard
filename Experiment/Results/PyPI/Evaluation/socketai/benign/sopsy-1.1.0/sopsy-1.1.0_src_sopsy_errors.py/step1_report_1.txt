  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the SOPSy application to handle various error conditions.",
  "sources": "No external data input or untrusted data sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output channels are present; the code only defines exceptions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this code; it's purely structural definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is straightforward class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class, with descriptive docstrings. No input, output, or data processing occurs. No use of external libraries, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The structure is simple and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this code. It functions solely as error class definitions for the application.",
