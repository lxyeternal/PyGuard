  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Purpose**:\n   - The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - The classes are named to reflect specific error conditions related to the SOPSy application and its interaction with SOPS.\n   - The only notable issue is a consistent typo: `SopsyUnparsableOutpoutTypeError` (extra 'o' in 'Outpout').\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks**:\n   - The code is purely structural: class definitions with docstrings.\n   - No external data, input/output, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n   - The typo is benign and does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no malicious intent.\n   - The only anomaly noted is the typo in class names, which is minor and non-security-related.\n   - No external data sources, data flows, or obfuscation are present.\n   - No suspicious patterns or malicious indicators are detected.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: Correctly 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Malware Score**: Correctly 0, no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Risk Score**: Correctly 0, as the code is benign, serving only as error class definitions.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - The consistent typo does not impact security but should be corrected for clarity.\n   - The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions mean it cannot be exploited or cause harm.\n\n**Final Assessment & Recommendations**:\n\n- The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- The typo, while minor, should be corrected in the actual codebase for clarity but does not influence security assessment.\n\n**Estimated scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThis code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for error handling within an application. There are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The minor typo should be fixed for clarity but does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is safe and non-malicious. The scores are justified, and no further action is necessary beyond correcting the typo for clarity.",
