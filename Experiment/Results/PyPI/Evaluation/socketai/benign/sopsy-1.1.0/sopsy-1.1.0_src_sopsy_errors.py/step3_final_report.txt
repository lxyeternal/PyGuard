  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOPSy error handling related to SOPS operations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with static exception messages; no input/output or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; exception classes are used for error handling within the application.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in class name 'SopsyUnparsableOutpoutTypeError' (extra 'o' in 'Outpout'), which is benign but should be corrected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with descriptive docstrings. No dynamic code, external dependencies, or obfuscated patterns are present. The typo in the class name is consistent across reports and does not introduce security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly assign malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as 0, reflecting the benign and straightforward nature of the code. The minor typo does not impact functionality or security but should be fixed for clarity. Overall, the code is harmless, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward set of exception class definitions with a minor typo that does not affect security. The assigned scores are appropriate. Correcting the typo would improve code clarity but is not critical for security. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.",
