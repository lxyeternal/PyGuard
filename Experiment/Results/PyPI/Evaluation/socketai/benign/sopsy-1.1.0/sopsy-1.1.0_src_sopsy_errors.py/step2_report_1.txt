  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Logical Consistency:**\n   - The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - All classes have descriptive docstrings explaining their purpose.\n   - There is a consistent pattern, and no dynamic code or external dependencies are used.\n   - **Notably**, there is a typo in the class name `SopsyUnparsableOutpoutTypeError` (extra 'o' in 'Outpout'). This typo appears across all reports, indicating it's likely an oversight rather than malicious obfuscation.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks:**\n   - The code is purely structural, defining exception classes.\n   - No input/output operations, no external calls, no data processing.\n   - No obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns, no embedded malware.\n   - The typo does not introduce security vulnerabilities; it's a minor naming error.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign `0`. No security issues are evident.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign `0`. Given the benign nature, this is reasonable.\n\n4. **Additional Observations:**\n   - The consistent typo in class names is minor but should be corrected for clarity.\n   - No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; the reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n5. **Final Assessment & Recommendations:**\n   - The code is standard, harmless, and functions as intended for error handling.\n   - The typo should be corrected to prevent confusion.\n   - The scores are reasonable and align with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, just to acknowledge the typo, but it's negligible)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, benign set of exception class definitions with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The only issue is a minor typo in class names, which should be corrected for clarity but does not impact security. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
