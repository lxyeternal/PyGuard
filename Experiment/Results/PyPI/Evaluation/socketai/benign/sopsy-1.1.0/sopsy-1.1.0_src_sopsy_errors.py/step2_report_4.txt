  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Purpose:**\n   - The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - The classes are named to reflect specific error conditions related to SOPS operations.\n   - The only notable issue is a consistent typo in class name: `SopsyUnparsableOutpoutTypeError` (extra 'o' in 'Outpout').\n\n2. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code itself contains no functional logic, data processing, external calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The typo in class name is benign but should be corrected for clarity and correctness.\n   - No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, only defining exception classes.\n   - They correctly identify the typo but note it does not pose security risks.\n   - No external data, network operations, or code execution is involved.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent are detected.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior or code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** 0 — the code is purely structural with no security implications.\n   - The typo does not impact security; it’s a minor naming issue.\n\n5. **Potential Risks & Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code is only class definitions, there are no vulnerabilities or malicious activities.\n   - The consistent typo should be corrected, but it doesn't affect security or malware considerations.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are justified here; the code appears benign.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment & Recommendations:**\n   - The code is safe, with no security risks or malware.\n   - The only minor issue is the typo, which should be fixed for clarity.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n\n| Score Type      | Reasoning                                                                                 |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score   | 0 — no malicious activity detected.                                                     |\n| Obfuscated Score | 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.                                    |\n| Risk Score      | 0 — no security risks; only class definitions for error handling.                        |\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, with no security or malware concerns. The typo is minor and does not influence the security posture. The reports' assessments are accurate, and no further action is necessary beyond correcting the class name typo.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is safe.\n- No malware or obfuscation.\n- No security risks.\n- The typo should be fixed for correctness but does not impact security.",
