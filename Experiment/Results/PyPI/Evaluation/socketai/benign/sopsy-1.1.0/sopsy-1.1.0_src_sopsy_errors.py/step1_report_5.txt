  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to the SOPS (Secrets OPerationS) tool within a larger application or script.",
  "sources": "The class definitions and their docstrings, which are static and do not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not include input/output operations or data handling that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "None; there are no source-to-sink data flows, as this code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code appears to be standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes inheriting from the base Exception class, each representing specific error conditions related to the SOPS tool. The classes include descriptive docstrings and follow a consistent pattern. There are no external data reads, no code execution, and no suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a larger application that manages secrets via SOPS.\n\nThere are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. It is purely structural for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It is benign and purely structural for error handling within an application.",
