  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to the SOPS (Secrets OPerationS) tool or library.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this is purely exception class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in class name 'SopsyUnparsableOutpoutTypeError' (likely should be 'SopsyUnparsableOutputTypeError'), but this does not pose a security risk.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. These classes are intended for structured error handling within a larger application or library. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors present. The typo in class name is a minor issue and not indicative of malicious intent. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines standard exception classes with no malicious or security-related issues. It does not contain any behavior that could harm, disrupt, or leak data. It appears to be a straightforward, benign utility component.",
