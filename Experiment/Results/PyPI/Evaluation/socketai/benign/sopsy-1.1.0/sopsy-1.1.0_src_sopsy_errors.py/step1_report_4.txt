  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the SOPSy application to handle various error scenarios.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; exception classes are used internally.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; exception classes do not perform data leaks or security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input or external sources; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in class name 'SopsyUnparsableOutpoutTypeError' (likely intended as 'Output'). No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception class. These classes are used for error handling within the application. There is no data input/output, no external calls, and no suspicious behavior. The typo in the class name is a minor concern but not malicious. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward definition of custom exception classes with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of standard error handling logic for a Python application.",
