  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to SOPS operations.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; only exception class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in class name 'SopsyUnparsableOutpoutTypeError' (extra 'o') but no malicious implications; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception. There are no data inputs, external calls, or executable code. The typo in one class name is benign and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, external communication, or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, defining exception classes with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as part of error handling within a larger application. No signs of malware or security threats are evident.",
