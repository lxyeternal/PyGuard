  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is simple: class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's Exception.\n- The only notable issue is a consistent typo: \"SopsyUnparsableOutpoutTypeError\" (extra 'o' in 'Outpout') across all reports.\n- No external data, input/output, or executable code is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are all zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issue presence:** The exception classes are present as defined; no issues are introduced by the code itself.\n- **Typo:** The typo is minor and does not impact functionality or security but should be corrected for clarity.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; the code is purely structural.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Correctly 0; no security risks are evident.\n\n### Potential adjustments:\n- The typo in class names, while benign, could be flagged as a minor quality concern. However, it doesn't justify a higher risk or malware score.\n- Since all reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments, no score adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a benign, straightforward set of exception class definitions.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The typo is minor and does not impact security.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural with no malicious intent. The minor typo should be corrected, but it doesn't influence the security assessment. The current scores are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, non-malicious, and standard for error handling. No changes needed in the scores or analysis.",
