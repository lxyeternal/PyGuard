{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a Python wrapper module for SOPS, a tool used for managing encrypted files, providing error handling and exposing classes and errors for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports error classes and core classes from the 'sopsy' package, which are likely used elsewhere in the package but do not read input or data directly in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects within this snippet; the code primarily defines imports and an exported list.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident in this code segment; it mainly sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The imports and definitions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific error classes and core classes from the 'sopsy' package and defines an __all__ list for exports. It contains no logic, data processing, or dynamic behavior. No potential security issues or malicious intent are observable in this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a straightforward module initializer for the 'sopsy' package, primarily handling exports. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this code segment.",
