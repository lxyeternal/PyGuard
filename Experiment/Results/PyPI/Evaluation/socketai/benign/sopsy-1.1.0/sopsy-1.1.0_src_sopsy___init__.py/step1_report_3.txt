{
  "purpose": "To provide a Python wrapper interface for the SOPS encryption tool, enabling easier integration and error handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'sopsy.errors' and 'sopsy.sopsy' modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to critical functions or outputs; the code mainly imports and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected. The comment indicates reliance on an external binary (SOPS).",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific error and class definitions from internal modules and exposes them via __all__. There are no dynamic executions, hardcoded secrets, or external data handling. The purpose appears to be to create a simplified interface for a wrapper around an external tool. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or security risks are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module interface definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It primarily facilitates access to wrapper classes and error definitions. The security risk is minimal.",
