{
  "purpose": "A Python wrapper module for SOPS, importing error classes and core classes, and defining public API exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'sopsy.errors' and 'sopsy.sopsy' modules, no external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication; purely import/export setup.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in class name 'SopsyUnparsableOutpoutTypeError' (likely intended as 'Output'), but this is a benign typo, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports error and core classes, defines __all__, and contains a comment about the SOPS binary requirement. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or external communication is present. The only minor issue is a typo in a class name, which does not impact security. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: near zero) are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard wrapper module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only concern is a typo in the class name, which should be corrected for correctness but does not pose a security risk.",
