{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python module that provides a wrapper around the SOPS binary, facilitating its use within Python programs.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load specific error classes and core classes from the sopsy package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing occurs; no data is read from external sources or written to external systems within this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only sets up imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration. No hardcoded secrets, malicious constructs, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports error classes and core classes from the sopsy package and explicitly defines the module's public API via __all__. There is no execution of untrusted code, no network activity, and no handling of sensitive data. The comments indicate that SOPS binary must be installed, but this is a standard prerequisite and does not imply malicious intent. The structure is simple and standard for a Python wrapper module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup for a Python wrapper around SOPS. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves as a clean interface for other code to use the sopsy package.",
