  "purpose": "A Python wrapper for the SOPS encryption tool to facilitate encrypting, decrypting, and managing encrypted files.",
  "sources": "Reads file paths (self.file), command-line arguments (self.global_args), environment (shutil.which), config data (build_config), and subprocess output (run_cmd).",
  "sinks": "Executes external 'sops' binary with constructed command-line arguments; possibly reads/writes files; invokes system commands.",
  "flows": "Input file paths and configuration data are used to build command-line arguments, which are passed to the 'sops' command executed via run_cmd. The output is processed for decryption/encryption results and key retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "Uses temporary files for config data (potential, but standard practice). No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or misleading variables detected. The code correctly checks for 'sops' binary presence.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a wrapper around the 'sops' CLI, constructing command-line arguments based on user input and executing the commands securely. It verifies the existence of the 'sops' binary before use. It handles temporary configuration files safely, relying on external functions (build_config, run_cmd) that are presumed secure. No malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection, are evident. No suspicious network activity or hidden processes are present. The code relies on trusted subprocess execution and standard Python libraries. Overall, it appears secure with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate wrapper around the SOPS tool for managing encrypted files. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. The implementation appears correct and secure, with proper checks and no indicators of sabotage.",
