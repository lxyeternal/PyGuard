  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure wrapper around the 'sops' CLI, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to temporary file handling, which is standard. The scores and analysis are consistent and appropriate."
