  "purpose": "A Python wrapper for the SOPS tool to encrypt, decrypt, rotate, and manage SOPS encrypted files.",
  "sources": "File path inputs, configuration files, environment variables for executable paths, command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Shell command execution via run_cmd, reading files for encryption/decryption, temporary config file creation.",
  "flows": "Input paths and configuration data flow into command construction, which then flows into shell execution via run_cmd.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no hidden backdoors. Usage of temporary files is standard but could be considered a minor risk if misused. No external network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely wraps the SOPS command-line tool, building command arguments based on user inputs and configuration files. It uses safe practices like resolving file paths, verifying the presence of the binary, and using temporary files only for configuration. There is no dynamic code execution, no network communication, and no handling of untrusted input beyond file paths and arguments. The only minor concern is the use of temporary files for config, which is a common pattern and unlikely to be malicious. Overall, the code appears well-structured, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard wrapper for the SOPS tool with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It follows good security practices and does not introduce any evident security risks.",
