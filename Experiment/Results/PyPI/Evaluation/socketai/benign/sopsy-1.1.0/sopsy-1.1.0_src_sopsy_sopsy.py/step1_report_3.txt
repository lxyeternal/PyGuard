  "purpose": "A Python wrapper around the SOPS encryption tool to facilitate encryption, decryption, and key management of configuration files.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files, SOPS files, environment (via shutil.which for the binary), command line arguments, and optional config dicts or files.",
  "sinks": "Executes subprocess commands to run the 'sops' binary with constructed arguments, potentially passing untrusted data through command parameters.",
  "flows": "User supplies file paths and configuration options which are used to construct command-line calls to the 'sops' binary; decrypted or encrypted data is returned by run_cmd, which executes these commands.",
  "anomalies": "Uses tempfile to create temporary configuration files for the 'sops' command, which is standard but worth noting. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are evident. No suspicious network activity or obfuscation is present. The code mainly wraps external command execution and handles file paths.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations to facilitate calling the external 'sops' binary for encryption/decryption tasks. It validates the presence of the 'sops' binary via shutil.which, preventing execution if not found. No input data from untrusted sources is directly executed; inputs are file paths and configuration options. The use of temporary files for configuration is typical and safe. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The subprocess command construction appears straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The logic relies on external tools and does not process data inline in a suspicious manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a wrapper for the 'sops' encryption tool, with no indications of malicious intent. It performs typical file and process handling securely, with validation of external dependencies. There are no signs of malware or security risks within this code fragment.",
