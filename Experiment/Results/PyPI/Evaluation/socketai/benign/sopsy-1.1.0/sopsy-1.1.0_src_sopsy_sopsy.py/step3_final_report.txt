  "purpose": "A Python wrapper around the 'sops' CLI tool for encrypting, decrypting, rotating keys, and retrieving data from encrypted files.",
  "sources": "Reads file paths, configuration files, environment variables, and user inputs for command options.",
  "sinks": "Executes external 'sops' command via subprocess, passing constructed arguments and handling output.",
  "flows": "Constructs command-line arguments from inputs, verifies 'sops' binary, executes commands, and returns decrypted/encrypted data.",
  "anomalies": "Uses tempfile with delete=False for configuration files, which could leave residual files if not cleaned, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper delegating cryptographic operations to the external 'sops' CLI. It performs validation of the binary's presence, manages configuration via temporary files, and constructs commands based on user parameters. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected. The use of temporary files is common, and no network activity or data exfiltration is present. The code's structure and logic are clear and secure, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure wrapper around the 'sops' CLI, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to temporary file handling, which is standard. The scores and analysis are consistent and appropriate.",
