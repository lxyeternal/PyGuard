      "conclusion": "The code appears safe and standard for resource scaling, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main risk is the potential for infinite loops if external methods misbehave. The provided reports are empty, so no issues are confirmed. Overall, the code is low risk and free of malware or obfuscation."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate Kubernetes management tool with inherent risks due to its capability to execute arbitrary code. No malicious or suspicious code is embedded. The main security concern is the environment's potential to run malicious code if misused, which is accurately reflected in the high security risk score in report 5. The malware scores are correctly set to zero, as no malicious code is present. The overall assessment confirms that the code itself is safe but should be used cautiously in untrusted environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The reports lack sufficient detail to indicate any security concern. Therefore, the overall security risk is negligible, with malware and obfuscation scores set to 0, and a very low risk score of approximately 0.1 reflecting the absence of evidence."

The main risks are associated with subprocess execution and environment variables, which are typical but should be secured. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a low risk score (~0.2) is appropriate."

The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is justified given the handling of secrets but no malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident."
