  "purpose": "Client library for Kubernetes-like API resources, enabling querying, filtering, watching, and data representation.",
  "sources": "API responses (JSON), user-provided filter parameters, URL construction functions.",
  "sinks": "URL endpoints, JSON deserialization, object instantiation, API request handling.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into URL parameters and JSON parsing; data from API responses flows into object creation and cache.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code; use of 'assert' for validation is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client for Kubernetes-like resources. It handles network requests, JSON parsing, and object management without executing untrusted code or performing malicious actions. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or sabotage are present. The use of 'assert' statements for validation is typical and not security-critical. The code's data flows are typical for such clients, with no suspicious manipulations or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API client with no malicious intent or behavior. It does not contain obfuscated code or malicious payloads. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.2) reflects the potential for external data to influence URL parameters but does not indicate any vulnerability or malicious activity.",
