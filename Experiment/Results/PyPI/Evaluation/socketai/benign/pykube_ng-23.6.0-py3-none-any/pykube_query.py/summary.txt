  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API client with no malicious intent or behavior. It does not contain obfuscated code or malicious payloads. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.2) reflects the potential for external data to influence URL parameters but does not indicate any vulnerability or malicious activity."
