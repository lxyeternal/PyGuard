  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Kubernetes API client with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main risks are associated with subprocess execution and environment variables, which are typical but should be secured. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a low risk score (~0.2) is appropriate."
