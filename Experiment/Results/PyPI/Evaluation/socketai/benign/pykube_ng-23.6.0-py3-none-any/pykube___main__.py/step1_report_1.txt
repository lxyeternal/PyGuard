{
  "purpose": "The code imports the main function from a local module named 'console' and executes it.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data directly; it relies on the imported module and its main() function.",
  "sinks": "The code calls main(), which could potentially perform any actions defined within the console module.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to executing the main() function imported from the console module; no external data flows are evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only calling main() from a local module. There are no hardcoded credentials or unusual constructs. Lack of context about 'console' makes full assessment limited.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports and executes main() from a local module. Since the code itself contains no suspicious behavior, the security risk depends entirely on what main() does within the console module. Without access to that, there's no evidence of malicious behavior in this snippet. The code structure is simple and standard for script entry points.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears benign and is likely just a typical entry point calling a main function. There are no signs of malicious activity or security issues within this limited scope, but the security assessment of the entire package depends on the content of 'console.main'.",
