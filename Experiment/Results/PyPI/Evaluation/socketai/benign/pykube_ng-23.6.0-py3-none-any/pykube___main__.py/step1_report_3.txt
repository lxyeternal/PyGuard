{
  "purpose": "This code imports and executes the main function from a local console module, likely to run a command-line interface or application.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'console' module and the 'main' function from it.",
  "sinks": "The execution of 'main()' is a sink where control is transferred; potential untrusted data handling depends on 'main()' implementation.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'main' to executing 'main()' directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple entry point that imports and runs a main function from a local module. There are no apparent malicious behaviors or suspicious code patterns. Without seeing the implementation of 'console.main', there are no indicators of malicious activity at this level. The code itself performs a typical pattern for CLI applications.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard minimal script to run a main function from a local module. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based solely on this snippet.",
