  "purpose": "Minimal script that imports and executes main() from a local console module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .console, calling main()",
  "sinks": "Execution of console.main(), potential for malicious behavior depends on its implementation",
  "flows": "Import .console -> call main()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and call pattern",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard entry point pattern with no suspicious constructs. The security implications rely entirely on what console.main() does, which is outside this snippet. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The security risk score is low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk but acknowledging potential actions within main(). Confidence in benign assessment is high (around 0.8-0.9). No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation is present in this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign; the scores are appropriate given the minimal and standard pattern. The primary concern is the behavior of console.main(), which cannot be assessed here. Overall, the code is safe, and the current scores accurately reflect its benign nature.",
