{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'main' function from a module named 'console' in the same package and executes it.",
  "sources": "The 'main' function from '.console' module",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' which may perform various actions depending on its implementation",
  "flows": "Import from '.console' -> call to 'main()' -> execution of code within 'main()'",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code structures are evident; code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "This code is a simple module that imports and immediately executes a function called 'main'. Without the implementation of 'main', it is impossible to determine its behavior or any potential malicious actions. The pattern is common for script entry points. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The security assessment depends on what 'main()' does, which is outside the scope of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point pattern with no inherent malicious behavior or security risks evident in this fragment. The safety depends on the implementation of 'main()' in the 'console' module.",
