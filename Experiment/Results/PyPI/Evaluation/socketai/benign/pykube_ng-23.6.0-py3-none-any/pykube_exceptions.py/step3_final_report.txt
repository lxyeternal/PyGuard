  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Kubernetes error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with no external data input or dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow from untrusted sources or external outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static class definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class hierarchy with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static class definitions for error handling in Python, with no external data processing, network operations, or obfuscation. All classes inherit from built-in exceptions or each other, serving as structured error categories. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and purpose as error class definitions confirm its safety and lack of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for Kubernetes errors. No malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
