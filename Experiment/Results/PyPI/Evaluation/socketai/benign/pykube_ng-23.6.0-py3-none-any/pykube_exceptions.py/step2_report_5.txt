  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code only defines exception classes with no external data processing, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behaviors.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is simple class definitions serving as error handling scaffolding.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, indicating certainty about the benign nature of the code.\n   - The risk scores are 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any malicious or insecure elements.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - Since the code only contains class definitions for exceptions, with no external input, no data flow, and no malicious code, the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is standard and safe.\n   - No overreach or unwarranted suspicion is present.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is purely boilerplate exception class definitions.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive behavior is present.\n- The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, straightforward, and does not pose any security threat. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet provided.",
