{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Kubernetes-related errors, specifically for use in a Python Kubernetes client library.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and exception inheritance, no external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only defines classes and does not process untrusted data or perform actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only declares exception classes with minimal logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of exception classes for handling Kubernetes errors. Each class inherits from the previous, with HTTPError storing an error code and message. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behaviors. The implementation appears standard for custom exception definitions in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains simple, well-structured exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It serves as a typical error handling framework within a Python Kubernetes client.",
