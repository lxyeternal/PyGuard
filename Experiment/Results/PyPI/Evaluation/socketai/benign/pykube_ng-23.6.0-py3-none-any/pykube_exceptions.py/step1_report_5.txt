  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Kubernetes and PyKube error handling.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading; exception class instantiations occur internally.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks as there is no runtime data processing or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code is standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward custom exception classes inheriting from built-in Exception and other custom classes. The only variable attribute is 'code' in HTTPError, which is a typical pattern for error codes. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. There are no external data sources, sinks, or operations that could be exploited. The code appears to be boilerplate for error handling within a Kubernetes client library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, safe, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not involve external inputs or actions that could be exploited. The code serves as a structured way to handle exceptions in a Kubernetes-related Python project.",
