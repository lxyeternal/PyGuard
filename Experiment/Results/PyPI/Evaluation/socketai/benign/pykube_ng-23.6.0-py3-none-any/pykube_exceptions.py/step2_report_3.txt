  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for Kubernetes error handling in Python.\n- Classes include `KubernetesError`, `PyKubeError`, `HTTPError`, and `ObjectDoesNotExist`.\n- `HTTPError` stores an error code and message.\n- All classes are straightforward, inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception` or other custom exceptions.\n- No external data processing, dynamic code execution, or system interactions are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Assessment of Reports:**\n- All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, well-structured, with no malicious intent, malware, or security risks.\n- They correctly identify that the code is static class definitions serving error handling purposes.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The sources and sinks are limited to class definitions, with no data flow or external interactions.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0\n- These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Critical Considerations:**\n- The code appears benign and typical for exception handling.\n- No signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or data exfiltration.\n- The only potential concern might be if this code were part of a larger, malicious package, but based solely on this snippet, there's no evidence of that.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n- The security risk score should stay at 0.\n- The overall risk is negligible.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Risk score: **0**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for Kubernetes error handling, with no malicious or security concerns detected.",
