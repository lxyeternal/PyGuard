  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling Kubernetes-related errors in a Python application.",
  "sources": "No input or external data is read; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to untrusted sources; exception classes do not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external input or output; exception instantiation is limited to message and code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions for Kubernetes errors, with a specialized HTTPError class that stores an error code and message. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no suspicious behavior or code patterns. The structure is straightforward and typical for exception handling in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
