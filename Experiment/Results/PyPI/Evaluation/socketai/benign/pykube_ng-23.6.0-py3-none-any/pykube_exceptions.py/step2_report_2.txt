  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for Kubernetes error handling.\n   - Classes include `KubernetesError`, `PyKubeError`, `HTTPError`, and `ObjectDoesNotExist`.\n   - `HTTPError` stores an error code and message.\n   - The code is static, with no dynamic execution, external input, or data processing.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks:**\n   - No external data handling, no network operations, no code injection, or other suspicious constructs.\n   - The classes are standard and serve as error categories, typical in Python applications.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Misinterpretations:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment; the code is simple and standard.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly states that the code is boilerplate error handling.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is purely structural, with no signs of malicious intent.\n   - The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and justified.\n   - No changes are necessary; the analysis aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Based on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The code appears safe, with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for Kubernetes error handling.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- Scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports provided.",
