  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Kubernetes-related errors in a Python application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are detected. The class hierarchy is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. These classes are designed to categorize errors related to Kubernetes operations, including general errors, specific PyKube errors, HTTP errors with a code and message, and a 'does not exist' error. There are no dynamic executions, external communications, or security-sensitive operations. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for Kubernetes error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks within this snippet.",
