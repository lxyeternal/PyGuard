  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for Kubernetes errors:\n     - `KubernetesError` (base)\n     - `PyKubeError` (inherits from `KubernetesError`)\n     - `HTTPError` (inherits from `PyKubeError`, with `code` and message)\n     - `ObjectDoesNotExist` (inherits from `PyKubeError`)\n   - The classes are straightforward, contain no dynamic code, no external data processing, and serve purely as error categorization.\n\n2. **Report Analysis:**\n   - All reports uniformly state that the code is standard, contains no suspicious or malicious patterns, and is typical for error handling in Python.\n   - No external data sources, no data flows from untrusted sources, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n   - The purpose across reports is consistent: defining exception classes for Kubernetes client libraries.\n\n3. **Potential Issues or Anomalies:**\n   - No anomalies, no suspicious constructs, no obfuscation.\n   - The code is static, with no runtime data processing or external interactions.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, consistent with straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 across all reports, as there are no security vulnerabilities, no external data handling, and no malicious code.\n\n5. **Critical Evaluation:**\n   - The reports are accurate; the code is safe and standard.\n   - The high confidence (1) across all reports is justified.\n   - No changes needed to the scores.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is purely exception class definitions, it cannot be malicious on its own.\n   - If integrated into a larger system, security implications depend on how these exceptions are used, but from this snippet alone, no issues are present.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, safe implementation of custom exceptions for Kubernetes error handling. No malicious, obfuscated, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
