  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Kubernetes-related errors, including specific HTTP and object-related errors.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources present; exception classes are used for error handling within a larger application.",
  "targets": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; exception classes are for internal error management.",
  "flows": "Error instances are created and raised in response to errors, but no explicit source-to-sink data flow is present in the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; code follows standard Python exception class definitions without unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes for Kubernetes error handling, inheriting from Python's base Exception class. The classes are straightforward and contain no code that reads external data, processes untrusted input, or interacts with system resources. The HTTPError class stores an error code and message, but does not perform any dynamic execution or network operations. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be part of a larger application and serves as a structured way to handle errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, well-structured exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.",
