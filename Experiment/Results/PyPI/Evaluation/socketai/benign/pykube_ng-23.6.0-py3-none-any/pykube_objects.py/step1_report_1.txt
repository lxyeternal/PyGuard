{
  "purpose": "Defines classes and functions for managing Kubernetes API objects, including creation, update, deletion, and specific resource handling.",
  "sources": "Input data includes API responses, configuration, and resource definitions; internal methods use object properties and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "API request methods such as get, post, patch, delete, and request, which can handle untrusted data if improperly sanitized.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class methods (e.g., create, update, delete) through API request functions, with JSON data being sent to the API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious URL/domain usage; reliance on standard API interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes a structured framework for Kubernetes object management, with extensive use of properties, API calls, and resource-specific subclasses. No suspicious code or backdoors are present. It correctly uses JSON serialization and standard HTTP methods. No hardcoded secrets, environment variable leaks, or malicious payloads are detected. The code handles data securely via standard API functions, and there are no signs of code injection or data exfiltration. Its purpose appears to be resource management, with no malicious intent inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured library for Kubernetes resource management. No malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident. The code is safe and does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
