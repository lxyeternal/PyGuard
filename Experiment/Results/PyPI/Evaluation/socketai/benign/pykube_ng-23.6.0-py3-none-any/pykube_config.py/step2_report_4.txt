  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report claims the code is standard, handles sensitive data securely, and shows no malicious activity. The code reads tokens, certificates, and configs from trusted sources, with no obfuscation or suspicious network activity.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the report's conclusion. Security risk is 0.2, reflecting low concern, which seems reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The report's reasoning and scoring are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard handling of kubeconfig, environment variables, and files. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation is noted.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 matches the analysis. Security risk 0.2 is appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The reasoning and scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Focuses on secure management of secrets, no signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, and standard practices.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.2—appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is described as standard configuration handling, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious network behavior.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2—aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scoring and reasoning are sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Describes the code as a typical kubeconfig handler, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2—consistent with the description.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code appears to be a legitimate Kubernetes configuration utility, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is justified. Security risk scores are low (0.2), consistent with the benign analysis.\n- **Potential concerns:** The only minor point is the creation of temporary files in `BytesOrFile`, but this is standard for handling certificates and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, standard configuration management risk)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the scoring reflects this appropriately.",
