  "purpose": "Configuration handling for Kubernetes clusters, including loading kubeconfig files, in-cluster configs, and URLs.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PYKUBE_KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST, PYKUBE_KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT, KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST, KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT, KUBECONFIG), filesystem (service account token, namespace, ca.crt, kubeconfig file, certificate files), URL input.",
  "sinks": "Reading token, namespace, certificate files; writing kubeconfig files.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and filesystem → data parsing and object creation → potential use of certificate data and tokens for cluster authentication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for cluster configuration; dynamic creation of certificate paths; no explicit hardcoded secrets; base64 decoding certificate data; no suspicious command execution or network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles reading and parsing configuration data from environment variables, files, and URLs. It carefully manages file paths, including relative paths, and reads tokens and certificates. The use of base64 for certificates and handling of kubeconfig files is standard. No code injections, remote code execution, or network communications are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code's structure and functions focus solely on configuration management with appropriate file handling and data processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate configuration utility for Kubernetes clusters without malicious intent. It manages configuration data securely and responsibly. No indicators of malware, malicious behavior, or supply chain sabotage are observed.",
