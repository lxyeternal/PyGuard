{
  "purpose": "The code manages Kubernetes configuration data, reading tokens, certificates, and kubeconfig files from environment variables, filesystem, or URLs, and handles temporary files for certificates.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST, KUBECONFIG), filesystem files (token, namespace, ca.crt), URLs, and in-memory data (base64-encoded certificates).",
  "sinks": "Reading tokens and certificates into memory, creating temporary files for certificates, writing kubeconfig files back to disk.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and filesystem files are read to load tokens, certificates, and configuration data; temporary files are created for certificates; data may be written back to disk if persisting configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; temporary file creation for certificates is standard practice; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles sensitive data, reads configuration from trusted sources, and manages certificates via temporary files. It performs standard configuration management tasks without network exfiltration, code injection, or malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The temporary files for certificates are created in a typical manner, and error handling is appropriate. Overall, the code is transparent, well-structured, and aligns with best practices for Kubernetes configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure Kubernetes configuration utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is justified given the handling of secrets but no malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident.",
