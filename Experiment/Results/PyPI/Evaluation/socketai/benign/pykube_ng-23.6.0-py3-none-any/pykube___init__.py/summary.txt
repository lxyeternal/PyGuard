  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The reports lack sufficient detail to indicate any security concern. Therefore, the overall security risk is negligible, with malware and obfuscation scores set to 0, and a very low risk score of approximately 0.1 reflecting the absence of evidence."
