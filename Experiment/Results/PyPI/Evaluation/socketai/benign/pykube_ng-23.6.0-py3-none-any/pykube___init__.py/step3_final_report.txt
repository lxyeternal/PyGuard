{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python client library for Kubernetes, primarily composed of import statements and version declaration, with no embedded logic or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Import statements from various modules within the package, version declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows indicating untrusted data handling or external data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical open-source Kubernetes client library, consisting of module imports and versioning. No executable logic, network calls, or data handling is present that could be exploited. The reports provided only mention 'Empty response' without additional context, logs, or payloads, which do not suggest malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The lack of detailed response data prevents any meaningful security assessment, but based on the code and reports, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The reports lack sufficient detail to indicate any security concern. Therefore, the overall security risk is negligible, with malware and obfuscation scores set to 0, and a very low risk score of approximately 0.1 reflecting the absence of evidence.",
