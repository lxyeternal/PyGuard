  "purpose": "Initialize and run an interactive Kubernetes management console with optional execution of user-provided code.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (--kubeconfig, --context, -c), kubeconfig file, user input in console",
  "sinks": "Execution of arbitrary code via console or -c argument, potential access to API objects and environment variables",
  "flows": "Input args -> kubeconfig loading -> API setup -> code execution environment -> user code or console interaction",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity; code allows arbitrary code execution in console",
  "analysis": "The script loads kubeconfig and context, sets up a pykube API client, and creates an interactive console environment. It permits execution of arbitrary Python code via the -c argument or user input, which is typical for such management tools. No malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is the potential for executing malicious code supplied by the user, which is inherent to interactive shells that run arbitrary code. The code itself is straightforward and intended for legitimate Kubernetes resource management. The scores assigned in the reports reflect this: malware=0, obfuscated=0, with low security risk (~0.2) for normal operation, and a high risk (~0.9) in the report highlighting the dangers of untrusted code execution environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate Kubernetes management tool with inherent risks due to its capability to execute arbitrary code. No malicious or suspicious code is embedded. The main security concern is the environment's potential to run malicious code if misused, which is accurately reflected in the high security risk score in report 5. The malware scores are correctly set to zero, as no malicious code is present. The overall assessment confirms that the code itself is safe but should be used cautiously in untrusted environments.",
