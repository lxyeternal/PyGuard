  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate Kubernetes management tool with inherent risks due to its capability to execute arbitrary code. No malicious or suspicious code is embedded. The main security concern is the environment's potential to run malicious code if misused, which is accurately reflected in the high security risk score in report 5. The malware scores are correctly set to zero, as no malicious code is present. The overall assessment confirms that the code itself is safe but should be used cautiously in untrusted environments."
