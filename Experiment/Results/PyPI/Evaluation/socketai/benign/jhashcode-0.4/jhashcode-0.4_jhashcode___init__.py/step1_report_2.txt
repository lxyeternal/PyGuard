{
  "purpose": "The code implements custom hashing functions for strings, Unicode strings, and integers, providing a hash code mechanism based on the input type.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input data through function parameters such as 's' for strings and 'i' for integers. It also reads Python version information from 'sys.version'.",
  "targets": "The main target is to produce a hash code for given objects; no other output or external communication is involved.",
  "flows": "Input data (strings, Unicode, integers) are processed by respective hashing functions via 'hashcode' which maps types to functions using '_TP_MAPPING'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. The code contains an unsupported 'unicode' type in Python 2, which is standard for backward compatibility but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom hash functions for specific data types, which could be used for consistent hashing within an application. It includes version-dependent type handling for Python 2 and 3, and defines an unsupported type handler '_unknown_hash' that raises an error if an unsupported type is encountered. The logic is straightforward, with no indication of malicious behavior. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or hidden actions. The code appears to be a utility module for hashing data based on type, with no malicious intent or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign hashing utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly handles data types and raises errors for unsupported types, which is typical for robust utility functions.",
