{
  "purpose": "Provides custom hashing functions for strings, unicode, and integers with version compatibility handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input parameter 'o' in the hashcode() function and the system version information from sys.version.",
  "sinks": "The hashcode() function returns a hash value based on input type, with no external or untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input 'o' is used to select and invoke a specific hashing function based on its type; no external data flows into or out of the system.",
  "anomalies": "The code raises a TypeError for unsupported types, but there are no indications of malicious obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script defines hashing functions for different data types, with version-aware type mappings. The functions are straightforward, standard, and do not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The use of a simple custom hash for strings is not inherently malicious, and the handling of integers is trivial. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to serve a utility purpose with proper error handling for unsupported types.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic utility for hashing various data types with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It is designed for internal use to generate hash values and does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks.",
