{
  "purpose": "Provides type-specific hashing functions for strings and integers, with Python version compatibility handling.",
  "sources": "Input data passed to hashcode(), which dispatches to type-specific functions based on type.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; functions return hash values directly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input to hashcode(), then to the type-specific hash functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple, deterministic hash functions for strings and integers, with a version-dependent mapping for Python 2 and 3. It raises an error for unsupported types. No external I/O, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The functions are utility in nature, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, version-compatible hashing utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minimal security risk score (0) is appropriate, and the malware score is zero. The code does not pose security concerns and functions as intended for hashing purposes.",
