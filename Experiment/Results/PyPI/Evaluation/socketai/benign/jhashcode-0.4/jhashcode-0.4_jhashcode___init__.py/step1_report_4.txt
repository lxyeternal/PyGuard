{
  "purpose": "The code provides custom hash functions for strings, unicode, and integers, and selects the appropriate function based on Python version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the type of input object 'o' in the hashcode() function, and reads the content of string or unicode objects in hash_str_unicode.",
  "sinks": "The output of hashcode() can be used as a hash value; potential misuse could involve hash collision attacks if exploited maliciously, but no direct data leakage or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Input object 'o' flows from hashcode() to a type-based hash function, which processes string/unicode or int data; no external data or system calls are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code primarily implements simple hashing functions without external side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically maps data types to specific hash functions based on the Python version. It employs a simple custom hash for strings and unicode, and a direct return for integers. No external inputs are processed apart from the object type, and the hashing functions do not interact with system resources or external networks. The use of version-dependent type mappings appears benign, aiming for compatibility across Python versions. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are evident. Overall, the code appears to serve as a utility for hashing with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for hashing data types, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It does not perform external communications or data leaks, and its purpose is straightforward. The overall security risk is negligible.",
