{
  "purpose": "The code provides hashing functions for strings, unicode strings, and integers, with a type-based dispatch mechanism.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from variables passed to hashcode() function; specifically, it reads the input object 'o' and its type.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the hashcode() function, which returns a hashed value based on the input's type.",
  "flows": "Input 'o' flows from hashcode() to the type-based mapping, which invokes either hash_str_unicode() or hash_int().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines hashing functions and uses a dictionary to map data types to these functions, based on Python version. It only performs simple hashing for strings and integers without any network or system interactions. No suspicious patterns, external data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The functions are standard and do not perform any harmful operations. The only potential concern is the type-checking mechanism, but it is benign and typical for version compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple hashing utility with no malicious intent. It is designed for type-specific hashing and handles Python 2 and 3 compatibility. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are detected.",
