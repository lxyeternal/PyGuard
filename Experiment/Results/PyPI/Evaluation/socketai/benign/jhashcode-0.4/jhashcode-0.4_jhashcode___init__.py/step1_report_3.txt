{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom hash functions for different data types and maps them based on Python version to generate hash codes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through function parameters 's' (string) and 'i' (integer). It also inspects the type of an object passed to 'hashcode'.",
  "sinks": "The hash functions return numerical hash values directly; no data is written or transmitted externally within this code.",
  "flows": "Input data (string or integer) is processed through respective hash functions, which are then called via 'hashcode' based on the type, resulting in numeric output.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a deprecated 'unicode' type reference for Python 2, which is expected behavior, not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious backdoors are present. No external network operations or file I/O are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script establishes hash functions for strings and integers, with a version check to support Python 2 and 3. The '_unknown_hash' function raises an error if an unsupported type is processed, ensuring type safety. The hashing functions are straightforward and do not perform any side effects or external operations. The code does not include any obfuscated or malicious constructs. It primarily maps types to functions and computes hashes accordingly, which appears legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of custom hash functions with version compatibility. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It serves as a utility for hashing with no evident security risks.",
