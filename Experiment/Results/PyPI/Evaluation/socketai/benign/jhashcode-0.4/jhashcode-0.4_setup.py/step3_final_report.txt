{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python module named 'jhashcode'.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata defined within the setup() call; no external or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, defines a static description function, and calls setup() with fixed metadata. It contains no dynamic inputs, network activity, or external data fetching. All indicators point to a benign, standard package setup script. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content and justified. The confidence score is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and assessments provided are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
