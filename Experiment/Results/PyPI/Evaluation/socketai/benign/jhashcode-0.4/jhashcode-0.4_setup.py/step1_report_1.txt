  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration for the Python package 'jhashcode'.",
  "sources": "Import statements (os.path, setuptools), function descr(), and setup() call with package info.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior or leaks.",
  "flows": "The setup() function uses static data to configure the package; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code is straightforward package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and defines a description function returning a static string. The setup() call includes package info, URLs, and configuration with no dynamic or external inputs. There are no apparent code injection points, malicious payloads, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and configuration. No anomalies or malware are detected.",
