  "purpose": "Define package metadata and setup configuration for the 'jhashcode' Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statements (os.path, setuptools), function descr() returning a static string, setup() function call with package details.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; setup() uses static strings and lists.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static data used for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns observed. The code is straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, defines a simple description function, and calls setup() with static package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, no user input processing, no network calls, or suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity.",
