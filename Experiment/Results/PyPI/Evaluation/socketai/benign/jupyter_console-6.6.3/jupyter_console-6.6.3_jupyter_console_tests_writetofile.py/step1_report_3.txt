  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",

It uses standard library functions without any suspicious logic or external calls. No untrusted data processing beyond file copying, no data exfiltration or malicious actions identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign file copying operation without any malicious intent. No security risks or malware behavior are evident.",
