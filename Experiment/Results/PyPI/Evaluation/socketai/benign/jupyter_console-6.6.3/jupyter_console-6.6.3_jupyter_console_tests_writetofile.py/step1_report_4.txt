{
  "purpose": "Copy data from input file to output file for testing purposes, handling binary data and stdin input.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command line arguments; sys.stdin.buffer if input is '-' ; open(inpath, 'rb') for reading input file.",
  "sinks": "write() method on open(outpath, 'w+b') to output the data read from input.",
  "flows": "Command line arguments -> determine input source -> read input data -> write to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious loops or obfuscated code, straightforward file copy operation.",
  "analysis": "The script reads two command line arguments for input and output paths. If input is '-', it reads from stdin buffer; otherwise, it opens a specified file in binary read mode. It then opens the output file in binary write mode and writes the entire input data to it. No external network activity, no suspicious code, and no embedded malicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a simple data copying utility, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic file copying script intended for testing, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs standard I/O operations safely and transparently.",
