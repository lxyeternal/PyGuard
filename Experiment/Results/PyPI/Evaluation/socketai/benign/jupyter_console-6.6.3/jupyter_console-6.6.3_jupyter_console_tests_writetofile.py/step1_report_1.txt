  "purpose": "Copy data from an input file to an output file, primarily for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from either a file specified by command-line argument or standard input if '-' is provided.",
  "sinks": "Data is written directly to an output file specified by command-line argument.",
  "flows": "Input source (file or stdin) flows directly into the output file without processing or validation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code performs a simple copy operation.",
  "analysis": "The script reads data from a specified input source, either a file or stdin, and writes it to an output file. It does not perform any data validation, transformation, or network activity. The file handling appears standard, and there are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The use of sys.stdin.buffer and straightforward file copying indicate a benign purpose intended for testing or data transfer.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for copying data from input to output, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It operates securely within its limited scope, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
