  "purpose": "Copy data from an input file to an output file, supporting stdin input, for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from a specified input file or stdin (if '-' is provided).",
  "sinks": "Writes data to the specified output file.",
  "flows": "Input source (file or stdin) -> read() -> output file write()",
  "anomalies": "Uses sys.stdin.buffer for stdin input, which is normal; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple file copying utility, copying binary data from input to output. It accepts input from stdin or a file, then writes to an output file opened in binary mode. The code uses standard library functions without any suspicious behavior. No data leakage, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code detected. No external network activity or malicious side effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward file copy utility intended for testing; no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
