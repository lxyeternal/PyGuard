  "purpose": "Copy data from input file to output file for testing.",
  "sources": "sys.stdin.buffer (if input is '-'), open(input_path, 'rb') for file input",
  "sinks": "write() to output file, reading from input source",
  "flows": "Input source (stdin or file) -> read() -> write() to output file",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that copies binary data from an input source (file or stdin) to an output file. It uses standard Python functions without obfuscation or malicious constructs. No data validation or sanitization is performed, but this is typical for such utilities. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, simple file copying utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
