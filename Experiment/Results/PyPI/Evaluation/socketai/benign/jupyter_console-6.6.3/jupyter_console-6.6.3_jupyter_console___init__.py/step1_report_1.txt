  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only internal import",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import is normal; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information from a local module, which is a common practice for maintaining package version data. There are no inputs from external sources, no network connections, and no suspicious operations. The code is minimal and standard for version management. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, only importing version info from a local module. It poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
