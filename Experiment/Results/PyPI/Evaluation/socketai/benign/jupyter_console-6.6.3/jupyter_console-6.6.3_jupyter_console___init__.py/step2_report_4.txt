  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\nReport 1:\n- The code only imports version info from a local module, with no external data, network activity, or suspicious code.\n- The conclusion that there's no security threat or malicious intent is correct.\n- The confidence score of 1 seems appropriate.\n- No issues identified; the logic is sound.\n\nReport 2:\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the relative import from '_version'.\n- The report notes that using a relative import from a \"private\" module could potentially be used to hide malicious code, but no evidence is present.\n- The conclusion that this is benign is justified.\n- Confidence of 0.9 is reasonable; it's slightly less than 1 due to the mention of potential misuse, but no actual issues are found.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\nReport 3:\n- Again, a straightforward import of version info.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- The conclusion aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- Confidence score of 1 is appropriate.\n\nReport 4:\n- Same pattern: import from a local '_version' module.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- The conclusion is consistent.\n- Confidence score of 1.\n\nReport 5:\n- Similar to previous reports, standard import for version tracking.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence score of 1 is suitable.\n\nOverall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal, standard import statement for version information.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The use of relative import from a local module '_version' is common in package development and not inherently suspicious.\n- The malware score is zero across all reports, which is accurate given the code's nature.\n\nMy own estimates:\n- Malware score: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- Obfuscated score: 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- Risk score: 0 (no security risk)\n\nIn conclusion, all reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat.",
