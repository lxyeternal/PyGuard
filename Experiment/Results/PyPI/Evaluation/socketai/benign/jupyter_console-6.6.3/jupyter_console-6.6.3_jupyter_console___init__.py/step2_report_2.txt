  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a simple import statement, importing version info from a local module. No data flows, external communication, or suspicious code are present.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** All scores (malware, obfuscated, risk) are zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; a relative import from a local '_version' module.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues. The analysis correctly states that the relative import is standard.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; straightforward import.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No problems detected.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; minimal import.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Zero, matching the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Zero, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports describe benign, standard import statements for version info.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The risk scores are all zero, fitting the benign nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- The current scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese align with the analysis: the code is straightforward, standard, and poses no security threat.",
