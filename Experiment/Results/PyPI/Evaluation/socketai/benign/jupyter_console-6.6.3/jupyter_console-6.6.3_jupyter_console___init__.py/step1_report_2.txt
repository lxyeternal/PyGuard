  "purpose": "Import version information from a local module",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '._version'",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "The import path is relative and references a private module '_version', which could be used to hide malicious code, but this alone is not suspicious without additional context",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information from a local module '_version', which is a common pattern for maintaining package versioning. The use of a relative import suggests it is part of a package's internal structure. There are no external data inputs, network connections, or dynamic code execution. The presence of 'noqa' indicates suppression of linter warnings, which is typical for internal imports. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign import statement used to retrieve version information from a local module. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
