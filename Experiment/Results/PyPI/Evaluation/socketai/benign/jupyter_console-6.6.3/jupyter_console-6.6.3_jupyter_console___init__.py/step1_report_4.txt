  "sources": "Import statement: from ._version import version_info, __version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no data flows to external systems or outputs",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; import is for internal use only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of version information from a local module named '_version'. It appears to be standard practice for maintaining versioning information within a Python package. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. The import is contained and does not involve any data processing or external communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, standard import statement for internal version management. No malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
