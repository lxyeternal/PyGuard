  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a minimal import statement; no issues are present.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Security risk and malware are both 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Justification:** The code is standard for version management, with no external inputs or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** The import of a local module '_version' is common; no issues detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0; this is consistent.\n- **Justification:** The relative import is typical for internal package versioning.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; straightforward import.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zeros for malware and security risk.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; standard import.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent with benign code.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others; standard import.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, aligning with the benign code.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, consistent with the code's purpose.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero across all reports; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Zero, as the code is a simple import statement with no external communication or data handling.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code snippet.",
