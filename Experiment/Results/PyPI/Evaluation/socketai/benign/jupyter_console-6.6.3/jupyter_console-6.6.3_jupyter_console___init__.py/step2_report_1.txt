  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code only imports version info from a local module; no external inputs or suspicious operations.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. Reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security concern.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, a relative import from '_version'.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The report notes that using a relative import from a private module could be suspicious, but in this context, it's standard.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. Reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign import.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent with benign code.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same import pattern.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** Zero across the board.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as others.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** Zero across the board.  \n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple, internal import statement for version info.  \n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk exists in the code snippets.  \n- The use of relative import from a '_version' module is standard practice in package development.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe reports are consistent and reasonable. The scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward internal version import, with no security threats or malicious intent. All scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
