  "purpose": "Import version information from a local module for package version tracking.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a local module '_version' via relative import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external communication or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "The source (import statement) does not lead to any data flow or external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import of version info from a local module, with no external inputs, network activity, or suspicious behavior. It uses a relative import which is standard in package development. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard internal version import with no security threats or malicious intent. It poses no security risk or malicious behavior.",
