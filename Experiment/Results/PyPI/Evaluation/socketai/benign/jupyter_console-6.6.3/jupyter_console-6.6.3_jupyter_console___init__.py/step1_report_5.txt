  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information from a local module, which is a common practice for version tracking. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data processing, and no code execution or external communication. The import statement is standard and does not suggest malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and standard, serving to import version info. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
