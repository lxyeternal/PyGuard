  "purpose": "Parse a version string (__version__) into its components: major, minor, patch, and optional rest.",
  "sources": "The __version__ string and the regex pattern matching it.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static version string parsing.",
  "flows": "Regex match -> extract groups -> convert to integers -> append rest if present -> build version_info tuple.",
  "anomalies": "Handling of match['rest'] without checking if match is None; otherwise, no anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward version string parsing using regex with named groups. It matches a static version string, extracts major, minor, patch, and optional rest components, converting numeric parts to integers. The logic is correct, with no external input, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The handling of the 'rest' component is appropriate. No suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious activity are present. The regex pattern is standard, and the code is simple and static. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version parser with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports accurately identify it as safe, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
