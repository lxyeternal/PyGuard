  "purpose": "Parse the version string __version__ into a tuple for compatibility purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ string and the regex match object.",
  "sinks": "The code converts matched version components into integers and constructs a tuple, which is used internally.",
  "flows": "The version string is matched by regex, parts are extracted and converted to integers, and optionally include the rest of the version string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior observed. The regex pattern and version parsing are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports re for regex operations, defines a version string, uses a regex pattern to parse the version string into major, minor, patch, and rest components. It performs matching and extracts parts into a list, converting numeric parts to integers. If the rest component exists, it appends it as a string. The logic is straightforward and typical for version parsing, with no dynamic code execution, data leaks, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard version string parsing without any malicious intent or security concerns. It is a benign implementation for compatibility purposes.",
