  "purpose": "To parse and construct a version information tuple from a version string.",
  "sources": "The __version__ variable containing the version string.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not output data or interact with untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The version string is read from __version__, then parsed with regex, and the parts are stored in a list and tuple.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses regex matching and dynamic list construction, but no anomalies or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string, applies a regex pattern to extract major, minor, patch, and rest components. It then converts the major, minor, and patch parts to integers, appends any remaining part if present, and stores everything in a tuple. The logic is straightforward and standard for version parsing. No external input, no output, and no malicious or suspicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version parsing routine with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues. It only manipulates a static version string for version info extraction.",
