  "purpose": "Parse version string into structured components for version handling.",
  "sources": "__version__ variable containing the version string.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send data elsewhere or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code reads __version__, matches it with regex, converts matched groups to integers, and constructs a tuple.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex match with named groups; no apparent anomalies or malicious patterns. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string, uses regex to parse major, minor, patch, and rest components, then converts these parts into a list and a tuple for further use. No untrusted input handling or data leaks are present. The regex pattern and usage are typical for version parsing. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is simple and intended for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version parsing routine with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply extracts version components and does not perform any malicious actions.",
