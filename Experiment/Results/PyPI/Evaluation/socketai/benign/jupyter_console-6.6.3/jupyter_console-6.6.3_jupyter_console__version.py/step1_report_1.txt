  "purpose": "Parse version string into a tuple of major, minor, patch, and optional rest for compatibility.",
  "sources": "__version__ variable containing the version string.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "Pattern matching of __version__ to extract version components; no external data flow or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex with named groups; potential issue with handling 'rest' if match is successful, but no malicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 're' and defines a version string. It uses a regex pattern to parse major, minor, and patch components. The match object is used to extract these parts and convert them to integers. It also attempts to handle an optional 'rest' component if present. The logic is straightforward, with no external input, no data leaks, or suspicious behavior. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present. The only minor concern is the handling of 'match['rest']' — if 'rest' is empty, it skips appending; otherwise, it appends, which is normal for version parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple version parsing with no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected. It appears to be a benign utility snippet.",
