{
  "purpose": "The code extracts version information from a version string using regex matching, primarily for backwards compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads the __version__ string and uses re.match to parse it.",
  "sinks": "Uses the match object to extract version components; no untrusted data handling or external effects.",
  "flows": "re.match processes __version__, and the matched groups are used to build a version_info tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and uses a regex pattern to parse the major, minor, and patch components. It then constructs a list of parts, converting matched groups to integers, and appends any remaining string segment. The use of regex and string parsing is standard, with no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or unsafe operations. There are no external data inputs or outputs, no network activity, and no obfuscated or suspicious code logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version string parser with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It appears safe and typical for version handling.",
