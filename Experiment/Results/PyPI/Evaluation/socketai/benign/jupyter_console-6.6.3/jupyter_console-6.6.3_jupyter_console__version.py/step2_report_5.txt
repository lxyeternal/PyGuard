  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Logic:**\n   - The code imports `re` and defines a version string `__version__`.\n   - It uses a regex pattern with named groups to parse the version string into major, minor, patch, and an optional rest component.\n   - It matches the pattern against `__version__`, then extracts the matched groups.\n   - The major, minor, and patch parts are converted to integers and stored in a list.\n   - If the 'rest' component exists, it is appended to the list.\n   - The list is then converted into a tuple `version_info`.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code is static, operating only on a hardcoded version string.\n   - No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - The regex pattern is straightforward and standard for version parsing.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n   - The logic is benign, aimed at version information extraction.\n\n3. **Potential Anomalies or Concerns:**\n   - The only minor point is the handling of `match['rest']` — if `rest` is empty, it skips appending, which is correct.\n   - No indication of any malicious intent or backdoors.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation or malware.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, reflecting high certainty.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Recommendations:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No changes needed in the scoring.\n   - The code does not warrant any higher risk score; it’s a standard version parser.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a simple, safe version parsing utility with no security issues or malicious behavior. The reports correctly reflect this, and I concur with their assessments.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
