  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `re` and `typing`.\n- Defines a version string `__version__ = \"6.6.3\"`.\n- Uses a regex pattern with named groups to parse `__version__`.\n- Matches the pattern against `__version__`.\n- Extracts `major`, `minor`, `patch` as integers.\n- Checks if there's a `rest` component; if so, appends it.\n- Builds a `version_info` tuple with these parts.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code performs straightforward version parsing.\n- No external inputs or outputs.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The regex pattern is standard for version strings.\n- No signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign and performs a common task safely.\n\n---\n\n### Reviewing the reports:\n\nAll five reports essentially describe the same logic: parsing a version string into components using regex, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. They consistently note:\n- No external data flows.\n- No untrusted data handling.\n- No obfuscation or malware.\n- The logic is straightforward and standard.\n\n**Errors or flaws:** None identified across reports; all agree on benignity.\n\n**Scores:** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very close to it; the code performs a benign version parsing.\n\n**Potential improvements or considerations:**\n- The only minor concern is the handling of `match['rest']`. The code checks `if match['rest']:` before appending, which is correct. No issues here.\n- The regex pattern is standard; no suspicious parts.\n- No external data or dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just acknowledging the regex parsing, but overall safe)\n\n**Additional note:** Since all reports agree on benignity, and the code is a simple version parser, no further suspicion is warranted.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimated Score | Justification                                                  |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                       | No malicious activity, no suspicious code patterns.           |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                       | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.             |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1                     | Very low; standard version parsing, no vulnerabilities.     |\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, with no security risks or malware. The existing scores are appropriate, but I would slightly lower the risk score to 0.1 for completeness, acknowledging the regex parsing without any risk.",
