  "purpose": "Utility function to wrap coroutine functions for synchronous execution.",
  "sources": "import inspect, typing, and functions from jupyter_core.utils",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data leaks or sensitive data handling detected",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; function wraps coroutine for blocking execution",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a type variable and a function 'run_sync' that checks if a given function is a coroutine. If so, it uses '_run_sync' to execute it synchronously; otherwise, it casts the input to a callable and returns it unchanged. The code uses standard Python modules and a Jupyter utility. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks are evident. No input/output or external data handling occurs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for managing asynchronous coroutine execution in a synchronous context. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
