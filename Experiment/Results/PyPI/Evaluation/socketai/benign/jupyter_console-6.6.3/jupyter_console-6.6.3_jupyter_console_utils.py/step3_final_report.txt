  "purpose": "Utility function to execute coroutine functions synchronously if needed.",
  "sources": "inspect.iscoroutinefunction check, _run_sync import, input parameter 'coro'.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network calls, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Input 'coro' is checked; if coroutine, wrapped with _run_sync; else returned as-is.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that distinguishes coroutine functions from regular callables and wraps coroutine functions with _run_sync for synchronous execution. It uses standard, trusted modules and functions. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is correct, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-understood utility for managing asynchronous execution in Python, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports accurately assess this, and no modifications are necessary.",
