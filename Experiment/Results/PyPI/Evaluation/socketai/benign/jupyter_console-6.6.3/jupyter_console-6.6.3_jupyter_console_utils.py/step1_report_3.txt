{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility function to run asynchronous coroutines synchronously, wrapping coroutine functions to execute them in a blocking manner.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (inspect), typing, and jupyter_core.utils (run_sync, ensure_async). No input data sources detected within the code itself.",
  "sinks": "The function _run_sync is called if the input is a coroutine function, which executes the coroutine. No external data sinks or network interactions are evident.",
  "flows": "If a coroutine function is passed, it flows into _run_sync, which executes it synchronously; otherwise, the original function is returned as-is.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward utility wrapper with standard imports and functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility to facilitate running asynchronous code in a synchronous context. It checks if the input is a coroutine function using inspect.iscoroutinefunction. If so, it wraps the coroutine with _run_sync to run it synchronously. If not, it simply casts and returns the original function. The imports are from standard and well-known libraries, and no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present. The code does not perform network operations, file modifications, or other potentially malicious actions. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose in asynchronous programming contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for handling asynchronous functions synchronously. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. It is a standard implementation using publicly available modules.",
