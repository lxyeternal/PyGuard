  "purpose": "Utility function to run asynchronous coroutines synchronously using Jupyter's utils.",
  "sources": "import statements for inspect, typing, and jupyter_core.utils",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external outputs",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from input to output involving untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard utility functions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic function 'run_sync' that wraps a coroutine to run synchronously, using Jupyter's 'run_sync' utility. It checks if the provided function is a coroutine, and if so, wraps it; otherwise, returns it unchanged. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, data leaks, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for async execution management in Jupyter environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for coroutine execution control with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
