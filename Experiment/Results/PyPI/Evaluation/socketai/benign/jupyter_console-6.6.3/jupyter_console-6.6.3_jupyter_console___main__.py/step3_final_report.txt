  "purpose": "Launches a Jupyter console session using the 'app' object from the 'jupyter_console' package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'jupyter_console' package, specifically 'app'.",
  "sinks": "The method 'launch_new_instance()' which initiates a console session.",
  "flows": "Import of 'app' -> calling 'app.launch_new_instance()' when the script runs as main.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known package and calls a method to launch a console session. No untrusted input, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The method invoked is standard for starting a Jupyter console. Multiple reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk scores (~0 to 0.2). The confidence levels are high, and no logical flaws are evident. The potential concern about misuse of 'launch_new_instance()' is theoretical, not evidenced here. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign script to launch a Jupyter console session. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's nature and risk profile.",
