  "flows": "Importing 'app' -> calling 'launch_new_instance()' method",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a component from a well-known library 'jupyter_console' and, if run as the main module, calls a method to launch a new console instance. This is typical usage for initializing a Jupyter console session. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard practices for launching a Jupyter console. No obfuscation, malware indicators, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign script to launch a Jupyter console instance. There are no malicious behaviors or security concerns detected.",
