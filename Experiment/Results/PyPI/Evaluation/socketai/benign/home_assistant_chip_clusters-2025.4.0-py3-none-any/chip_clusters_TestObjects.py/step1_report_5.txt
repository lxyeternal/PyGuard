{
  "purpose": "Define data structures and commands related to the OnOff cluster, including enums for effects and command classes for turning devices on and off.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'chip' module, class definitions, class variables, and method decorators",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing observed",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow from input sources to sensitive operations; code mainly defines static classes and constants",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behaviors. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external communications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data model for cluster commands in a smart device protocol. It uses enumerations to represent effect variants and simple class-based command definitions. The imports are standard, and no runtime data processing or external I/O is present. The code appears to be a typical part of a larger SDK or library. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data structure definition for device commands, with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It appears to be part of a normal SDK for device control.",
