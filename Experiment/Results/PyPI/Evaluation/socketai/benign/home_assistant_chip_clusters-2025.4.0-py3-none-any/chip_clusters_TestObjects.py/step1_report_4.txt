{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and command classes for OnOff cluster in a Zigbee-like protocol implementation.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'chip', and class declarations that do not read external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no external data output or network transmission observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; code primarily defines static classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of data classes and enum types representing commands and effects related to an OnOff cluster. It imports standard modules and a utility class, defines enum types for different effects, and command classes with descriptor methods. No external inputs, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present. The structure appears to be part of a larger, well-defined protocol stack with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a schema or protocol definition for device commands and effects. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign and purely declarative, with no indication of malware or security threats.",
