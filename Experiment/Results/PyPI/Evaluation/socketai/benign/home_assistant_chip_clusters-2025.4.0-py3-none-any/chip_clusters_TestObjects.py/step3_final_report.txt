{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures, enums, and command classes for an OnOff cluster, likely used in smart device protocols to control device states.",
  "sources": "Static class definitions, enum declarations, and command class constructors; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing, network communication, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is declarative and does not execute runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with clear class and enum definitions, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static data class definitions for device commands and effects, with no external data input, network activity, or dynamic behavior. It uses standard Python modules and a custom 'chip' module. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or runtime vulnerabilities are present. The command classes include descriptors, but these are static and benign. The overall structure indicates a protocol schema or data model for device control, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static protocol data model for device commands, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate and justified.",
