{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and commands related to the OnOff cluster in a Zigbee-like protocol, including enumerations for effects and commands for turning devices on and off.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules (typing, dataclasses, enum, chip, ClusterObjects). No input data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sink points for untrusted data or external system interaction. No output or network communication points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and enums.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. No external communication, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a data schema definition for commands within a protocol, using Python dataclasses and enums. It imports modules, defines constants, enumerations, and command classes with descriptors. There are no external data inputs, no runtime behavior, no network operations, and no apparent malicious intent. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a protocol implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard protocol schema definition with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as intended for defining commands and effect types, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
