  "purpose": "Define classes and enumerations for OnOff cluster commands and effects in a Zigbee-like protocol implementation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules, class and enum definitions, and class properties.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows; the code primarily defines static data structures and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external inputs to vulnerable sinks; the code contains no input handling or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments observed. The code is straightforward and consists of data structure definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical data model for a device cluster, defining command classes and enumerations. There are no input/output handling, network communication, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The import of 'chip' and related modules suggests integration into a larger framework, but the code itself appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cluster command definitions with enumerations. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, security risks, or malicious intent. The overall structure indicates safe and intended use within a larger protocol stack.",
