  "purpose": "Define a class Nullable representing a null value with custom comparison and hashing behavior",
  "sources": "No external input sources; class methods operate on internal state or passed arguments",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; class implementation appears straightforward and benign",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class Nullable with methods for representation, equality, inequality, less-than comparison, and hashing. It creates a singleton NullValue instance. There are no external data reads, no data leaks, no network activity, or code execution. The class seems designed for internal use to represent null values with specific comparison behaviors. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign class implementation for handling null values, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
