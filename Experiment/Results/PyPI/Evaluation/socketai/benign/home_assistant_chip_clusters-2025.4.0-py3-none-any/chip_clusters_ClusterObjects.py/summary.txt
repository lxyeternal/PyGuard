  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of CHIP data structures and serialization routines. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain compromise is evident within this snippet. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with a safe serialization framework."
