  "purpose": "Utility functions for byte array handling, string conversions, and memory operations using standard Python modules and ctypes.",
  "sources": "External pointers and byte arrays used as input for memory and data conversions.",
  "sinks": "Internal data flow; no external data exfiltration, network activity, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Pointer-to-byte array conversions and vice versa, with internal memory operations; no external data flow or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions for data and memory handling, employing standard Python modules and ctypes. It performs safe, well-understood operations without network activity or malicious patterns. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent are present. The data flows are internal, with proper type checks and memory management. The code's purpose is purely utility, and it aligns with typical low-level handling functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1—are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications or further investigations are necessary.",
