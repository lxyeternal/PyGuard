  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling byte arrays, hex strings, and C data types in the Chip project.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from external C pointers or byte arrays provided by other modules.",
  "sinks": "None directly identified; no external data outputs or untrusted data sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Conversion between C pointers and byte arrays, hex strings, and strings, but no untrusted data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code involves standard memory and data conversions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for data conversions and memory handling using standard Python and ctypes libraries. It reads data from input parameters such as pointers and byte arrays, converts data between formats, and checks for all-zero byte arrays. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious network activity, or data exfiltration. The functions are straightforward and use common Python idioms for memory and data handling, with no obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module designed for internal data conversions within the Chip project. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies are identified.",
