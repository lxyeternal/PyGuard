  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling byte arrays, string conversions, and memory operations in the Chip project.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as byte arrays, pointers, and strings passed to static methods.",
  "sinks": "Data is converted between types, hex-encoded, or returned as memory views. No data is sent over network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (byte arrays, pointers, strings) are processed and returned after conversions or checks, with no external data flows or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code uses standard Python and ctypes functions for memory management.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for hex encoding, memory operations, and type conversions. It includes safe practices such as type checks and null handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code is straightforward, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection observed. The use of ctypes for memory operations is standard for interfacing with C code and does not indicate obfuscation or malware intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for data conversion and memory handling, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
