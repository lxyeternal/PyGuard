  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling byte arrays, conversions, and memory operations within the Chip project.",
  "sources": "None; the code only provides utility functions that operate on passed parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or external outputs are involved in the code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the functions perform isolated data transformations without external input or output flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses standard library functions and straightforward logic. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code offers static utility methods for byte array manipulation, memory handling, and string conversions, using safe practices and standard Python modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The memory operations rely on ctypes but are properly scoped and do not execute untrusted code. The overall structure is clear and maintains proper data handling, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module providing safe, standard functions for byte and string conversions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
