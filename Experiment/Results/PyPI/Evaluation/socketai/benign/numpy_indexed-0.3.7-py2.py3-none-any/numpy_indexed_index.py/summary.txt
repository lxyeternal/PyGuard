  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent utility for indexing and grouping keys, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor issue is the incomplete 'concatenate' method, which does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the benign and utility nature of the code."
