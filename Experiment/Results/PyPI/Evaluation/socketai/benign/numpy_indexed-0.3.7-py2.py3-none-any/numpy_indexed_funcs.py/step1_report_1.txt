{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for handling indexable objects, including counting, grouping, and statistical operations, on top of numpy and custom indexing classes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments (e.g., keys, values, boundary) and internally converts them using functions like as_index().",
  "sinks": "Uses numpy operations such as np.add.at, np.argmax, np.sort, np.searchsorted, and array indexing to process data; no untrusted data is directly written to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments through conversion functions (as_index), then into numpy operations for counting, grouping, and sorting; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or misleading variables; code appears well-structured for data processing only.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple data analysis functions leveraging numpy and custom index classes. Functions handle indexing, grouping, counting, and statistical measures, all within expected data processing patterns. No external I/O, network activity, or potentially malicious operations are present. The code uses standard numpy operations and custom classes for data manipulation, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The inclusion of import statements, author metadata, and clear docstrings suggests transparency. No anomalies such as backdoors, system access, or malicious data leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility module for data analysis and indexing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It relies solely on numpy and legitimate custom classes for data processing. The overall security risk is minimal.",
