{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for indexing, grouping, counting, binning, and aggregating data on top of the Index class, mainly for data analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy, numpy_indexed, and builtins; user-defined functions taking data inputs like 'keys', 'values', 'boundary', etc.",
  "sinks": "None identified explicitly; no functions write untrusted data to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through grouping, counting, aggregation functions, with intermediate use of Index objects and numpy operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code is standard data processing logic with clear purpose. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The module imports standard libraries and custom indexing/grouping modules, providing functions like count, count_table, binning, and a Table class for various data aggregation tasks. The functions operate on input data and use numpy operations to produce summaries or grouped results. The code structure is typical for a data analysis library; no code execution based on untrusted inputs, no network calls, or system modifications are present. The implementation appears straightforward and adheres to standard practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data utility library built for indexing and grouping operations. There are no indicators of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It is a typical open-source utility module for data analysis with no malicious behavior detected.",
