  "purpose": "The code imports the numpy package and monkey patches the numpy namespace by adding the numpy_indexed module as an attribute.",
  "sources": "import numpy, import numpy_indexed",
  "sinks": "Assignment of numpy.indexed = numpy_indexed",
  "flows": "Import numpy and numpy_indexed modules -> assign numpy_indexed to numpy.indexed",
  "anomalies": "Monkey patching the numpy namespace by adding an external module as an attribute. No validation or checks are performed before assignment. The purpose seems to modify the namespace dynamically, which can lead to unexpected behavior or conflicts.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports numpy and numpy_indexed, then assigns numpy_indexed to numpy.indexed. This is a dynamic modification of the numpy namespace. While not inherently malicious, such monkey patching can be used to inject or alter functionality in a way that might be confusing or potentially abused if misused. No sensitive data or credentials are handled, and there are no suspicious network or file operations. The code appears to be intended to extend numpy with additional functionality in a non-standard way.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple monkey patch of the numpy namespace by attaching numpy_indexed. It does not exhibit malicious behavior but could lead to unpredictable side effects in larger codebases. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from this snippet alone.",
