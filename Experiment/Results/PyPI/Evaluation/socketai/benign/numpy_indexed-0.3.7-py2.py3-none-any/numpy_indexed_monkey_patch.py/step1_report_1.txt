  "purpose": "Monkey patching the numpy namespace to include functions from the numpy_indexed package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for numpy and numpy_indexed, assignment to numpy.indexed.",
  "sinks": "Assignment operation that modifies the numpy namespace at runtime.",
  "flows": "Import numpy_indexed -> Assign to numpy.indexed.",
  "anomalies": "None. The code performs a common monkey patching technique without any obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the numpy library and a separate numpy_indexed package. It then assigns the numpy_indexed module to numpy.indexed, effectively injecting or overriding functionality in the numpy namespace. This is a standard technique for extending or patching libraries at runtime, not inherently malicious. No data is read from untrusted sources, and there are no network or system modifications. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple monkey patch to extend numpy with numpy_indexed functionality. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical extension pattern used by developers for convenience or compatibility.",
