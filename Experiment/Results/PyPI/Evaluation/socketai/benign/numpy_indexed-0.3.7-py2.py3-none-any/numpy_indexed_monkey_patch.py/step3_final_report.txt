  "flows": "Import numpy and numpy_indexed -> assign numpy.indexed = numpy_indexed.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward namespace modification without obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple monkey patch by importing numpy and numpy_indexed, then assigning numpy_indexed to numpy.indexed. This is a common pattern for extending numpy functionality dynamically. No malicious code, obfuscation, or data exfiltration is present. The potential risk lies in namespace pollution, which could cause conflicts or unpredictable behavior, but no malicious intent is evident. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (around 0.2), reflecting the benign nature but acknowledging possible side effects. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign monkey patch with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk is minimal and primarily related to namespace conflicts, which are acceptable in controlled environments. Scores are appropriate; no modifications needed.",
