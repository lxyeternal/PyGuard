  "purpose": "Utility functions for manipulating numpy arrays, including reinterpretation and viewing as objects or structured arrays.",
  "sources": "Reads from numpy arrays and their attributes, especially shape, dtype, and data views.",
  "sinks": "Data views and reshaping operations that could potentially be misused if provided with untrusted input, but are standard numpy operations.",
  "flows": "Input arrays are converted or viewed as different types or shapes without any external data or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code features present. Usage of numpy view and reshape operations is standard for array manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of numpy array utility functions for casting, viewing, and reshaping arrays. All operations are standard numpy techniques for array manipulation and do not involve external input/output beyond the input arrays provided. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The functions rely solely on numpy's array methods and do not include any network calls, file I/O, or system commands. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or backdoors are observed. The code is straightforward and intended for data structure reinterpretation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of standard numpy array utilities without malicious intent or security risks. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities within this code fragment.",
