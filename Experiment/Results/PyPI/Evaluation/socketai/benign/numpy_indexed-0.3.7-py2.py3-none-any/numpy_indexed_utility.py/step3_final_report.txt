  "purpose": "Utility functions for numpy array reinterpretation, casting, and structuring to facilitate data manipulation tasks.",
  "sources": "Input arrays provided to functions such as as_struct_array, axis_as_object, object_as_axis, array_as_object, and array_as_typed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; functions operate solely on provided numpy arrays without external data flows.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through casting, reshaping, and viewing operations within each function; no external or network interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard numpy operations with clear documentation. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard numpy utility functions performing array casting, reshaping, and viewing. All functions rely on well-known numpy methods such as view, reshape, rollaxis, and asarray. No external data sources, network activity, or system calls are present. The functions serve legitimate purposes in scientific and data processing contexts. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and uses common numpy idioms. Therefore, the likelihood of malicious intent or security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of numpy array utility functions with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
