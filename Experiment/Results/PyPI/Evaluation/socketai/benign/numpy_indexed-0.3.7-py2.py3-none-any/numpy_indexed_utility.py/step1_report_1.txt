  "purpose": "Utility functions for manipulating numpy ndarrays, including casting between object views and structured arrays.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as 'columns', 'arr', 'dtype', 'shape', and internal array operations like np.asarray, np.rollaxis, and np.view.",
  "sinks": "Returns of functions that produce new array views or copies; no data is sent externally or to network.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through casting and reshaping functions, resulting in different views or copies of the input arrays, with no external data leakage or malicious data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Functions perform standard numpy operations with no apparent malicious intent. No obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, and no suspicious variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several utility functions to manipulate numpy arrays: packing columns into structured arrays, casting array axes to void objects for sorting or comparison, converting void objects back to typed arrays, and creating object views of arrays. All functions rely on standard numpy operations, with clear parameter definitions and no indications of malicious behavior. There are no network operations, system calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The functions serve legitimate data processing purposes and do not contain hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of legitimate utility functions for numpy array manipulation, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears safe and solely intended for data processing tasks.",
