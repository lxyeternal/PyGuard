{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package by importing modules and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "os module for file path operations, imports from numpy_indexed library for array operations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points observed.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from sources to sinks; mainly imports and metadata definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, metadata definitions (__author__, __license__, __email__, __version__). It uses standard Python imports and third-party libraries without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling that could indicate malicious intent. The numpy_indexed imports are for mathematical and data processing functions, which are common in scientific computing packages. No suspicious code or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup with no malicious behavior detected. It does not contain malware, security risks, or obfuscation. Overall, it appears safe and typical for a Python library initialization.",
