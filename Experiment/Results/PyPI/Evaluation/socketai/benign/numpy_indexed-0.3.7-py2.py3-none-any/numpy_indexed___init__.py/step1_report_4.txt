{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up a Python package by importing modules and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ variable to determine the package directory",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data output operations are present",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flows involving untrusted sources are detected",
  "anomalies": "The code imports multiple modules from 'numpy_indexed' without any apparent use of dynamic code execution or obfuscation; no hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior is evident",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, imports modules from a 'numpy_indexed' package, and defines metadata such as author, license, email, version, and computes the package directory path. There are no signs of malicious code, suspicious data handling, or obfuscated logic. It is a typical package initialization file that provides no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup file with no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It primarily imports modules and sets metadata, with no suspicious activities observed.",
