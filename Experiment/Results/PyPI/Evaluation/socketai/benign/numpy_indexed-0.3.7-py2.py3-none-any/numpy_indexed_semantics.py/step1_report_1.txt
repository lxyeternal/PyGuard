{
  "purpose": "Provide a toggle for semantics related to handling key objects in numpy functions, with an emphasis on backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines variables and conditional logic based on a flag.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations that process untrusted data or perform output or I/O actions.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from source to sink exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; straightforward variable definitions and a simple conditional statement.",
  "analysis": "The code introduces a boolean flag 'backwards_compatible' to switch between two modes of operation. It sets 'axis_default' based on this flag, but the logic is simple and static. There are no external data sources, no user inputs, and no operations that could be exploited or cause security issues. The code is purely definitional and does not include any malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration toggle with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It serves a straightforward purpose of setting a default parameter based on a compatibility flag.",
