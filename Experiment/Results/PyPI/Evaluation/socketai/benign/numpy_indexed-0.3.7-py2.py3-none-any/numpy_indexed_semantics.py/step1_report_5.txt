{
  "purpose": "The code provides a toggle for switching between different semantics in handling key objects, particularly concerning numpy array behavior and backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "The only source of data input is the hardcoded boolean variable 'backwards_compatible'.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks, output, or external data interactions present in the code.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: based on the value of 'backwards_compatible', the variable 'axis_default' is assigned either None or 0.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is well-structured and simple.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a configuration toggle for semantic behavior in numpy array handling. It defines author and license metadata, then initializes 'backwards_compatible' to False, subsequently setting 'axis_default' accordingly. There are no external inputs, no data processing beyond a simple boolean check, and no malicious or suspicious code elements detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign configuration snippet intended to manage behavior semantics. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
