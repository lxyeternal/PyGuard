{
  "purpose": "Provides a toggle for semantics related to handling key objects in numpy-like functions, with an emphasis on backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads a configuration flag 'backwards_compatible' and sets a default axis value based on this flag.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The only flow is from the 'backwards_compatible' flag to the setting of 'axis_default' variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; the code is straightforward configuration logic with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines metadata, then sets a boolean flag for backward compatibility. Based on this flag, it assigns a default axis value. No external input handling, no data processing, no risky operations or external communications are present. The code appears to be purely configuration setup with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration toggle with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not involve any suspicious or harmful operations, and its purpose is clearly related to setting semantics for data processing functions.",
