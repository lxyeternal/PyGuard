  "purpose": "Configure semantics for handling key objects in a numpy-related context, toggling between backward-compatible and new behavior.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data is hardcoded or derived from internal variables.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets configuration variables based on a flag.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward configuration logic with no unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines metadata about the author and license, then sets a flag 'backwards_compatible' to False, and conditionally assigns 'axis_default' based on this flag. There are no inputs, outputs, or external dependencies; no suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The logic appears to be a simple toggle for semantic interpretation in a numpy context, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet with no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It serves to toggle between two semantics for key handling in a numpy-related operation, with no indications of suspicious activity.",
