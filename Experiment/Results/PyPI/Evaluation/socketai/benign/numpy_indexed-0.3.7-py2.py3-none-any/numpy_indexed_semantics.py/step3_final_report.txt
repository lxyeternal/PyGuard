{
  "purpose": "This code defines a toggle for backward compatibility semantics in handling key objects, setting a default axis based on the flag.",
  "sources": "The code reads the boolean flag 'backwards_compatible' to determine 'axis_default'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no sinks capable of data leakage or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the 'backwards_compatible' flag to the 'axis_default' assignment, with no external data or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is static, straightforward, and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple configuration snippet that sets a default parameter based on a boolean flag. It does not process external data, perform I/O, or execute any operations that could be exploited. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, purely for configuration, with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its benign purpose, and the scores are justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
