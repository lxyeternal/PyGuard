{
  "purpose": "Provides data grouping and aggregation functionalities using numpy and numpy_indexed, facilitating operations like splitting, reducing, and summarizing data based on keys.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters such as 'values' and 'keys'; internal index properties and numpy array manipulations.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data flows are confined within numpy arrays, index objects, and iterators.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'values' through index-based grouping, then to various reduction or splitting functions, with no external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a 'print' statement in 'split_sequence_as_iterable' likely for debugging; no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility for grouping and reducing data, relying solely on numpy and numpy_indexed libraries. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The debug print statement is benign and common during development. The code structure is clear, with well-defined methods for splitting, reducing, and aggregating data. No obfuscation or external system interactions are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured data grouping utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The minor debug print statement does not significantly elevate the security concern. Overall, the code is safe for supply chain use.",
