  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is a legitimate Robot Framework notification library, with no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The securityRisk is low, justified by the potential misuse if the webhook URL is compromised, which is a common concern with webhook integrations.\n- The malware score is appropriately zero.\n- The confidence score is high, given the thorough analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing straightforward, safe code with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis confirms no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The securityRisk is minimal, justified by the potential webhook URL misuse, but this is inherent to webhook-based systems.\n- The malware score is correctly zero.\n- The confidence is perfect, given the detailed reasoning.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a standard notification sender with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No malicious code or obfuscation detected.\n- The securityRisk accounts for potential webhook URL misuse, which is valid.\n- Malware score remains zero.\n- Confidence is high.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—legitimate, safe, with no signs of malware or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The security risk is associated with webhook URL security, which is standard.\n- Malware score is zero.\n- Confidence is high.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- Slightly lower securityRisk score (0.1) compared to others, possibly reflecting minimal concern beyond standard webhook security.\n- Malware remains zero.\n- Confidence is high.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- All reports agree the code is a straightforward, legitimate notification utility.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.\n- The security risks are primarily related to webhook URL security, which is inherent to such integrations and justified.\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, standard webhook security considerations)\n\n**Justification:** The code performs test result reporting via webhooks with proper validation and exception handling. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious features. The minor security risk relates to webhook URL management, which is a known and accepted concern in such integrations.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal security concern beyond standard webhook management)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the consensus across reports.",
