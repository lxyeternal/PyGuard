  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Standard notification library, webhook URL supplied externally.\n- Sinks & Flows: HTTP POST requests, response printed.\n- Anomalies: No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Functionality limited to posting messages, with input validation and standard exception handling.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low, acceptable).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar purpose and flow.\n- Emphasizes input validation and standard request handling.\n- No suspicious activity or code patterns.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focused on test reporting.\n- Validates parameters, sends data via requests.\n- No secrets or malicious code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to previous, with emphasis on webhook security.\n- No malicious activity, only legitimate notification sending.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern, straightforward implementation.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity. The code only constructs and sends JSON payloads over HTTP(S) to user-provided webhooks. No code suggests data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. **Malware score should remain at 0.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear, well-structured, and straightforward. **Obfuscated score remains at 0.**\n\n- **Risk Score:** The primary risk involves the potential misuse of webhook URLs, which are externally supplied. If an attacker controls the webhook URL, they could send spam or malicious messages. However, this is a common risk with webhook integrations and not specific to this code's implementation. The reports assign low risk scores (~0.1-0.2), which seem appropriate.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — minimal, typical for webhook-based notification tools, assuming proper webhook security.\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, legitimate, and free from malicious or obfuscated content.**",
