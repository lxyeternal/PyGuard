  "purpose": "A Robot Framework library for posting messages and test results to Slack or Mattermost via webhooks, with input validation and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Webhook URL provided externally; input parameters for message content and attachments.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to the webhook URL; response text printed for debugging.",
  "flows": "post_message_to_channel receives data, constructs JSON payload, sends via requests.post, response handled or printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; standard exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate notification posting with input validation, proper error handling, and no malicious or obfuscated code. The only security concern is webhook URL management, which is inherent to such integrations. No signs of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The print statement for response text is benign for debugging purposes. Overall, the code is safe and aligns with typical usage patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation for test notifications with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security risk relates to webhook URL security, which is standard for webhook-based tools. Scores are consistent with the analysis.",
