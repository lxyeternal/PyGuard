  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior**:  \n   All reports consistently indicate that the code is a straightforward implementation of a Robot Framework notification library. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are detected. The primary function is to send test results and messages via webhooks, which is a legitimate use case.\n\n2. **Potential Risks and Data Flows**:  \n   The only notable risk is the reliance on externally supplied webhook URLs. If these URLs are compromised or malicious, they could be used to send spam or harmful messages. However, this is inherent to webhook-based integrations and not indicative of malicious code within the library itself.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. I concur with this assessment.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, mainly reflecting the potential misuse if webhook URLs are compromised. This is reasonable.  \n   - **Overall Risk**: Given the analysis, the overall risk is minimal and primarily related to external factors rather than the code itself.\n\n4. **Logic and Reasoning Flaws**:  \n   The reports are thorough and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is a legitimate notification utility with no malicious intent. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores with Analysis**:  \n   The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the detailed reasoning. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Clear, straightforward code.  \n- **Risk Score**: **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to external webhook dependency, but acceptable.\n\n**Summary**: The code is a legitimate, well-structured Robot Framework notification library with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The primary concern is the security of the webhook URL, which is outside the scope of the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: If I were to assign my own scores based on this review, I would keep them consistent with the reports:\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the understanding that the code is safe and the risks are external and manageable.",
