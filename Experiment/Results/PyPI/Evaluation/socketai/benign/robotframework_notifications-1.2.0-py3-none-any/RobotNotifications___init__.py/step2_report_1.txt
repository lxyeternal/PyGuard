  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, standard exception handling, legitimate purpose.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low security risk score reflects potential misuse if webhook URL is compromised, which is acceptable. No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no hardcoded secrets, input validation in place, standard network operations.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1\n- **Assessment:** Well justified. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Straightforward notification sender, no secrets, no obfuscation, proper validation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings. No malware, minimal security risk due to webhook URL exposure.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—safe, validated, no obfuscation, standard network usage.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, no malicious code, no secrets, standard usage.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with the clean code.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly varied but generally very low, justified by the fact that webhook URLs could be misused if compromised, which is a typical risk for webhook-based integrations.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the detailed analysis.\n- No changes needed; the reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n- The overall risk is minimal, with no malware or obfuscation present.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, mostly related to webhook URL security, which is inherent to such integrations)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the code is a legitimate, safe implementation for test notifications, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.",
