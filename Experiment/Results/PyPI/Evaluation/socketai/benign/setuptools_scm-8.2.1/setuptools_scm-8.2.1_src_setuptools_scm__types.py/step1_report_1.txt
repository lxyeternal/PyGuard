{
  "purpose": "The code defines type aliases and imports for type checking, primarily to facilitate type annotations in other parts of the project.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python standard library modules (os, typing, sys) and a local module (.version).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions are present that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up type aliases and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code uses standard type hinting techniques and conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code uses conditional imports based on Python version to define type aliases, which is a common pattern for maintaining compatibility. It imports standard modules and a local version module, but does not perform any data processing, network communication, or other potentially malicious activities. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident in the code. The structure and content are typical for a module setup or type annotations configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be a standard setup for type hints and version compatibility, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
