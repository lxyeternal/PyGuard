  "purpose": "Define type aliases for path, command, version schemes, and SCM version with compatibility considerations.",
  "sources": "Standard modules (os, sys, typing, typing_extensions) and local .version module; conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; purely structural setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward type alias definitions and compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup for type annotations and compatibility across Python versions. It imports necessary modules, defines type aliases, and conditionally imports based on Python version. No data processing, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with common practices for maintaining compatibility and type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
