{
  "purpose": "The code defines type aliases and imports for type checking and version handling, likely used in a larger project for version management and path handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from os, sys, and type annotations from typing and typing_extensions; conditionally importing version module.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this fragment mainly sets up type aliases and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Conditional import based on Python version is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python features for type annotations and compatibility across Python versions. It imports standard libraries and conditionally imports typing extensions and a version module. No code performs any data processing, network activity, or potentially malicious operations. There are no visible side effects or suspicious behaviors. This appears to be a straightforward setup for type annotations and version handling in a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup for type annotations and version management with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
