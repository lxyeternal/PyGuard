  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of individual reports:**\n\n- All reports describe code that primarily sets up type aliases, conditional imports for compatibility, and imports standard modules and a local version module.\n- None mention any data processing, network activity, or handling of untrusted data.\n- All note the absence of anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and malware/security risk scores are zero or near zero.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code snippets are syntactically correct and do not contain any evident errors.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No evidence of vulnerabilities such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- **Potential supply chain risks:** The code is standard, dependency setup, and does not include external untrusted data handling.\n\n### Flaws or logical issues:\n- The reports are consistent; no logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n- The use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard practice for compatibility.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected or claimed.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports, aligning with the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- The risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the detailed review, **the code appears entirely benign and standard for a type-annotated, version-compatible Python module setup**. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — extremely low, just a standard setup code with no security implications.\n\n**In conclusion, the reports are accurate, and the code is safe.**",
