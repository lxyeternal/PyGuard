{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and import necessary modules for a Python project, likely related to version handling and path management.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (os, sys, typing, typing_extensions) and a local module (.version).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Usage of conditional imports based on Python version is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type aliases for clarity and compatibility, using conditional imports for Python version differences. It imports standard modules and a local version module. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is well-structured for compatibility across Python versions, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for type annotations and compatibility handling in a Python project. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security concerns are evident.",
