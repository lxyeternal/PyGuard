  "purpose": "Define type aliases and conditional imports for version handling and path specifications.",
  "sources": "import os, sys, and typing modules; conditional import of 'version' module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data outputs identified",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily type alias definitions and imports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious constructs. Use of conditional imports is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type aliases for paths, command types, and version schemes. It uses conditional imports to handle differences between Python versions, which is common for compatibility. No external data reads, no execution of untrusted input, nor suspicious behavior. The code appears to be purely structural and type-definition oriented, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for type alias definitions and compatibility handling; no malicious or security concerns detected.",
