  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, primarily setting up type aliases and conditional imports for compatibility.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, no network activity, no data processing, or other suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The code relies on conditional imports based on Python version, which is a common pattern.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code appears syntactically correct.\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n   - The type aliases are straightforward and standard.\n   - Conditional imports are used properly for compatibility.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are apparent.\n   - The code's logic is simple and correct.\n   - The type annotations and conditional imports are correctly implemented.\n\n3. **Scores evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the benign nature.\n   - Risk scores are 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the clarity of the code.\n   - Confidence scores are high (mostly 1), justified by the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Risk justification:**\n   - No reason exists to assign a higher risk score than 0.5, given the benign nature.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could lead to security issues.\n\n5. **Malware score:**\n   - Correctly set to 0 in all reports, reflecting no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they recognize the code as standard setup code.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis, with no contradictions or unreasonable assignments.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, standard setup for type annotations and version compatibility.**  \n**No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.**  \n**Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the scores should reflect that. The current scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and contains no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.",
