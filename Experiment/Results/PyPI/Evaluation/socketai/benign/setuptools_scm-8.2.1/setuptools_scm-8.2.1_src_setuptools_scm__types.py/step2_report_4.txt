  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code snippets are purely about setting up type aliases, conditional imports for compatibility, and importing standard modules and a local version module.\n- There are no data flows, network operations, file handling beyond type hints, or any runtime logic.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` and conditional imports based on Python version is standard practice for maintaining compatibility.\n- The local `.version` module is imported, but without further context, there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard setup.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Conclusion:** Standard setup, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Conclusion:** Typical type aliasing and compatibility handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Conclusion:** Standard type alias definitions and compatibility.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Conclusion:** Typical setup for type annotations and version management.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Synthesis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity; the code is standard for type hinting and compatibility.\n- **Obfuscated score:** None of the reports show obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured setup for type annotations and version compatibility.\n- No signs of supply chain risk, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's content.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the absence of any suspicious elements.",
