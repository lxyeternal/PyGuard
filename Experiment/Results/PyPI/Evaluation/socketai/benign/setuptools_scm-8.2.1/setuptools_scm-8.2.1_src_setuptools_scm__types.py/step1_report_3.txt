{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases for file paths, command types, version schemes, and SCM versioning, primarily for type hinting and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (os, typing, sys) and a local module (.version).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up type aliases and conditional imports.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import based on sys.version_info, which is normal; no suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles type aliasing and conditional imports to maintain compatibility across Python versions. It imports standard modules and a local module (.version) for versioning purposes. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling that could indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be a typical, well-structured setup for type hinting with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The use of TYPE_CHECKING ensures that type hints are only evaluated during static analysis, which is standard practice. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for type hinting and compatibility across Python versions. There is no malicious behavior, no malware indicators, and no security risks. It is safe and appears to be part of a larger, well-structured codebase.",
