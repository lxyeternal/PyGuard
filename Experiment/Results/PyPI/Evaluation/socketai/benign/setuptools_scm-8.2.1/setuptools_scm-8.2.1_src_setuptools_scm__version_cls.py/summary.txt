  "conclusion": "The code itself does not contain malicious payloads but employs a pattern—dynamic import based on user input—that can be exploited if inputs are untrusted. The security risk is moderate to high depending on context. No malware or obfuscation is present. The scores are appropriate; the primary concern is the need for input validation to mitigate potential exploitation."
