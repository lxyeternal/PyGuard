  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core logic, potential security issues, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  The code's dynamic import via `importlib.import_module` and `getattr` is present and functional. No code or input directly indicates malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes?**  \n  The report correctly identifies that dynamic import without input validation can be risky. It notes the absence of sanitization, which is accurate.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate; no malicious code detected)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.75 (high, due to dynamic import with untrusted input)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (not obfuscated)  \n  - Overall, the scores seem reasonable.\n\n- **Justification for Risk:**  \n  The high security risk score is justified because untrusted input to dynamic import functions can lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  Yes, the `import_name` function performs dynamic import based on user input, which can be exploited.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The report accurately highlights the lack of validation and the potential for malicious code execution.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (no malware detected)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.75 (justified)  \n  - The reasoning aligns with the code behavior.\n\n- **Additional Comments:**  \n  The report emphasizes the risk in `import_name`, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  Yes, similar dynamic import pattern exists, with potential for exploitation if inputs are untrusted.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The report correctly states that dynamic import can be risky without validation.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.3 (lower than others, perhaps slightly conservative)  \n  - Given the potential for exploitation, a higher score (e.g., 0.5) could be justified.\n\n- **Justification for Scores:**  \n  The risk is primarily in dynamic import, which is well-understood and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  Yes, dynamic import based on user input is present.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The report accurately notes the potential risk but states no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.4 (reasonable, given the potential risk but no actual malicious code)  \n  - This seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  Yes, the dynamic import pattern is present and potentially exploitable.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The report correctly states that no malicious code is evident but the risk exists if inputs are untrusted.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (low, considering no malicious activity)  \n  - Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Scores:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no evidence of malicious code.\n\n- **Obfuscated Scores:**  \n  All 0, as code is clear and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Security Risk Scores:**  \n  Most are around 0.75, reflecting the potential danger of dynamic import with untrusted input.  \n  For some reports, especially #3 and #4, slightly lower scores (0.3-0.4) are acceptable but could be marginally increased to 0.5 to better reflect the risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious code detected.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** **0.5** — a balanced view considering the potential for exploitation via dynamic import without validation. This is a common security concern but not malicious in itself.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nThe core logic is standard for version handling, but the use of dynamic import functions with user-controlled strings is a security concern. The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable, with a slight suggestion to elevate some risk scores to 0.5 for a more cautious stance.\n\n**Note:** Always validate and sanitize user inputs when performing dynamic imports to mitigate these risks.",
