  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core logic, potential vulnerabilities, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights that dynamic import via `importlib.import_module` and `getattr` on user-provided strings can lead to arbitrary code execution if inputs are malicious. Correctly notes the absence of input sanitization and the security risk this poses.\n\n- **Score justification:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code present.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n  - **Risk:** 0.75 — high due to potential for code injection via untrusted input.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The report accurately identifies the security concern: dynamic imports with untrusted input can be exploited. The reasoning is sound, and the score reflects the severity appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes that the `import_name` function's dynamic import and attribute access can be exploited if 'name' is controlled by an attacker, leading to code execution.\n\n- **Score justification:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — no malware detected.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.  \n  - **Risk:** 0.75 — aligns with the risk of malicious code execution via unvalidated dynamic imports.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The analysis correctly points out the security implications of dynamic import without validation. The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, notes that dynamic import of modules based on untrusted input ('name') is a security concern, but no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Score justification:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — no malware.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n  - **Risk:** 0.3 — lower than others, perhaps underestimating the potential risk.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The risk score might be somewhat conservative; dynamic import without validation is inherently risky. However, since there's no evidence of malicious code, the score is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that dynamic import based on untrusted input can be exploited but finds no malicious intent.\n\n- **Score justification:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — no malware.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.  \n  - **Risk:** 0.4 — moderate, considering potential misuse.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The risk score is consistent with the potential danger if inputs are malicious, though no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the security implications of dynamic import, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Score justification:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — no malware.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n  - **Risk:** 0.2 — low, assuming proper usage.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The risk score is reasonable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk scores:** Vary from 0.2 to 0.75, generally reflecting the potential security risk of dynamic imports with untrusted input.\n\n### **My Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.6 — the core concern is the use of dynamic import with unvalidated user input, which could lead to code execution if exploited. While no malicious activity is observed, the potential for exploitation warrants a higher risk score than the lowest.\n\n### **Final Remarks:**\n\nThe main security concern in this code is the dynamic import mechanism that depends on external input without validation. This is a known security risk but not inherently malicious. The scores across reports are generally consistent with this understanding.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type   | Final Estimate |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| Malware      | 0              |\n| Obfuscated   | 0              |\n| Risk         | 0.6            |\n\nThis reflects a moderate security concern primarily due to potential misuse, but no active malware or malicious intent is evident.",
