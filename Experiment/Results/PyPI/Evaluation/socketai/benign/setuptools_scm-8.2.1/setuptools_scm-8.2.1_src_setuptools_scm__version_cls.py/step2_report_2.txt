  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, correctness of reasoning, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  The report correctly identifies that dynamic import via `importlib.import_module` and `getattr` can be exploited if user input is malicious.  \n  The code itself does not contain malicious payloads; it's a version management utility.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes?**  \n  The report's reasoning is sound. It notes the security risk due to dynamic import without validation, which is accurate.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct, no malware present.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.75 — justified, as dynamic import with untrusted input is risky.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Overall, scores are reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's behavior. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Similar to Report 1, it highlights the risk of dynamic import leading to code execution if 'name' is maliciously controlled.\n\n- **Errors?**  \n  The reasoning is accurate. The code's core functionality is version handling, but the dynamic import pattern is risky.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.75 — justified.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct and consistent. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Again, the concern is dynamic import via `importlib.import_module` with untrusted input, which could be exploited.\n\n- **Errors?**  \n  The reasoning correctly identifies the potential risk but notes that the rest of the code is safe.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.3 — slightly lower than previous reports, but still justified given the risk level.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Similar pattern: dynamic import with user-controlled strings, potential for malicious code execution.\n\n- **Errors?**  \n  The reasoning is sound; no malicious intent is present, but the pattern is risky.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.4 — slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Same concern: dynamic import based on untrusted input.\n\n- **Errors?**  \n  Correctly notes the potential risk but emphasizes standard practices and no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 — conservative, reflecting the potential risk but no actual malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports recognize the dynamic import pattern as a potential risk, with scores ranging from 0.2 to 0.75, reflecting the varying degrees of concern based on context.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The core security concern is the use of `importlib.import_module` and `getattr` with user-controlled strings, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if inputs are malicious and unvalidated.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation is present.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.3 — moderate, mainly due to dynamic import pattern without validation.\n\n**Note:** In practical deployment, input validation or whitelisting should be added to mitigate the risk of malicious imports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the potential security concern stemming from dynamic imports with untrusted input but do not suggest actual malicious behavior. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's logic.",
