{
  "purpose": "Provides logging helpers supporting vendoring, with optional 'rich' library integration and context managers for dynamic configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SETUPTOOLS_SCM_DEBUG' for log level; external libraries 'rich' (optional) for enhanced handlers.",
  "sinks": "Logs are directed to stderr or rich console; no untrusted data sinks or external data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Environment variable influences log level; context managers temporarily modify logger propagation and levels; handlers process logs without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward logging utility with optional dependencies handled gracefully. It manages handlers and levels safely via context managers, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Environment variables control log levels, which is standard practice. The code does not process untrusted data in a malicious way, nor does it contain backdoors or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and safe. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1), reflecting minimal security concerns. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
