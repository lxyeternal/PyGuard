{
  "purpose": "To facilitate setuptools to use the attribute for versions, primarily for versioning in Python package builds.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'setuptools', 'setuptools_scm', and related functions; usage of __file__ to determine relative path.",
  "sinks": "Return of version string in __getattr__; no untrusted data sinks or network operations observed.",
  "flows": "The 'scm_version()' function calls 'get_version()' with specific parameters, which in turn uses various parsing functions; the '__getattr__' function sets and returns the version.",
  "anomalies": "The code comments suggest it is a 'hack' for version attribute management, but there are no signs of malicious code like network access, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages versioning via 'setuptools_scm' and fallback parsing methods. It attempts to parse version information from source control or package metadata, and provides dynamic attribute access for 'version'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data leakage, or code injection. The 'try_parse' list contains legitimate parsing functions. The overall structure is straightforward, and the comments indicate an internal utility purpose. No suspicious anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for version management in Python packaging. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indicators. It appears to be an intentionally minimal, hack-like utility with no harmful intent. Overall security risk is low.",
