{
  "purpose": "Configure the package setup to use a custom version scheme based on setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "The setup.py file reads no external input; it imports modules and defines a version function internally.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; the code does not process untrusted input or write data outside standard setup procedures.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; version calculation is internal and deterministic.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports 'guess_next_version' inside a function, which is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and 'setuptools_scm' to manage versioning. The function 'myversion_func' customizes version formatting using 'guess_next_version' for determining the next version. The setup() call specifies 'use_scm_version' with this custom scheme. The code is straightforward and follows standard practices for dynamic versioning. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network activity, credential handling, or system modifications, is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package that uses setuptools_scm for versioning. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
