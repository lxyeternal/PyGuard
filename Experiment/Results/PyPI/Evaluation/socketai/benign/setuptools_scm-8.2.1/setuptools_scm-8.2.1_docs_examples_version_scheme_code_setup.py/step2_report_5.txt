  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward setup script configuring versioning with setuptools_scm. The only \"anomaly\" noted is the dynamic import of `guess_next_version` inside the custom version function, which is unconventional but not malicious. There are no indications of code injection, external data handling, or other malicious behaviors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the unusual dynamic import but do not overstate its significance. No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The security risk scores are very low (~0.1), which seems appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The confidence levels are high, reflecting a solid understanding.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate. The highest is 0.1, consistent with the benign assessment.\n\n5. **Malware Score Analysis**:  \n   All reports correctly identify no malware activity. The code does not perform network operations, handle secrets, or execute untrusted code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent. They recognize the unconventional import but do not interpret it as suspicious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — Code is straightforward; no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 — Very low, justified by the unconventional import but no actual threat.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the assessments. The only notable point is the dynamic import, which is unusual but benign in this context. It does not elevate the security risk significantly.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0.1\n\n**Summary**: The code is a legitimate setup script for custom versioning, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores reflect this accurately.",
