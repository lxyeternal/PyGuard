  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Functionality Confirmation**:\n   - The code imports `setuptools` and `setuptools_scm`, defines a custom version scheme function `myversion_func` that internally imports `guess_next_version`, and passes this function to `setup()` via `use_scm_version`.\n   - The code does not process external input, write to external sinks, or perform any network or system modifications.\n   - The dynamic import of `guess_next_version` inside the function is unconventional but not malicious or suspicious.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for customizing version schemes with `setuptools_scm`.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n   - The dynamic import, while unusual, does not introduce security risks in this context.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Scores & Logic**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The security risk scores are very low (~0.1), which seems appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high (around 0.9 to 1), reflecting the clear understanding that this is a standard setup script with a custom version scheme.\n\n4. **Potential Overestimation or Underestimation**:\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0.1, which is reasonable.\n   - The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct since the code is transparent.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - No report claims or implies any malicious intent; all recognize the code as benign.\n   - The dynamic import is flagged as unusual but not malicious, which is a fair assessment.\n\n6. **Consistency & Recommendations**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and reports.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the overall assessment aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final Expert Estimation**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 (very low, due to unconventional import but no actual risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is a legitimate, standard setup script with a minor unconventional aspect (dynamic import), which does not introduce any security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is safe.\n- No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The current scores are justified and accurate.",
