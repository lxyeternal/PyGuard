{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script is used to configure the package versioning using setuptools_scm with a custom version scheme.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version information from the setuptools_scm library and applies a custom function to generate the version string.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the code does not write or transmit data or execute external commands based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The version object is passed to myversion_func, which then calls guess_next_version and formats the version string accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports guess_next_version within a function, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The import structure and code logic are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules from setuptools and setuptools_scm to manage versioning. The custom function myversion_func defines a custom version scheme that guesses the next version and formats it with a branch indicator and distance. The setup function is invoked with use_scm_version using this custom scheme. There are no suspicious network calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The code appears to be a standard and legitimate way to customize versioning in a Python package. The dynamic import of guess_next_version within the function is somewhat unusual but not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for managing package versions with a custom scheme. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is very low.",
