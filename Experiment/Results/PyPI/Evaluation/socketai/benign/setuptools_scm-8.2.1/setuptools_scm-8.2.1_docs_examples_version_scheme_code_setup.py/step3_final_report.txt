  "purpose": "Configure package versioning using setuptools_scm with a custom version scheme.",
  "sources": "Import statements, function definition, and setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no external data sinks, no network operations.",
  "flows": "The custom version function calls guess_next_version internally; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional dynamic import of guess_next_version inside the function, but no malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script that customizes versioning via setuptools_scm. The only unusual aspect is importing guess_next_version within the function, which is benign. No external input, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature and minimal unconventional pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup configuration with a minor unconventional import pattern that does not introduce security concerns. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
