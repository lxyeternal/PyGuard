  "purpose": "Configure the package setup with a custom version scheme using setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools and setuptools_scm, and the custom version function 'myversion_func'.",
  "sinks": "The 'setup' function with 'use_scm_version' parameter that calls 'myversion_func'.",
  "flows": "Imports -> 'myversion_func' -> 'setup' configuration -> version scheme application.",
  "anomalies": "The code defines a custom version scheme that dynamically guesses and formats the next version, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. No dynamic code execution or external connections are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for package setup and versioning. It defines a custom version function 'myversion_func' that uses 'guess_next_version' from 'setuptools_scm.version' to determine the next version, formatting it with a specific pattern. The 'setup' function is called with 'use_scm_version' configured to use this custom scheme. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors. The logic appears to be a legitimate customization of versioning scheme for package release management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration employing a custom version scheme for package versioning. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign customization for version control.",
