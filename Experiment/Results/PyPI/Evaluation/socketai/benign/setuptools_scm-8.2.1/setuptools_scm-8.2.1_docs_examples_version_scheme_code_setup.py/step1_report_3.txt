{
  "purpose": "The script is used to configure package setup, specifically to determine the package version using setuptools_scm with a custom version scheme.",
  "sources": "The code reads the setuptools_scm library and a version guess function from setuptools_scm.version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted input; the code primarily defines a versioning function.",
  "flows": "The setup() call invokes the custom version scheme function to determine the package version.",
  "anomalies": "The custom version function dynamically imports 'guess_next_version' within its scope, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules from setuptools and setuptools_scm for package versioning. It defines a custom version function 'myversion_func' that imports 'guess_next_version' dynamically and formats the next version string with a specific pattern. The setup() function uses this custom version scheme. The dynamic import within the version function is unusual but does not indicate malicious intent. No external network activity, credential handling, or suspicious code is present. The purpose appears to be a normal customization for versioning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a custom version scheme for packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The dynamic import is unconventional but benign in this context.",
