  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports `setuptools` and `setuptools_scm`.\n- Defines a function `myversion_func` that:\n  - Imports `guess_next_version` from `setuptools_scm.version` inside the function.\n  - Uses `version.format_next_version()` with `guess_next_version` and a custom format string.\n- Calls `setup()` with `use_scm_version={\"version_scheme\": myversion_func}`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Observations:\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no external input processing, no data leaks, or suspicious activity.  \n  The dynamic import of `guess_next_version` inside the function is unusual but not malicious.\n\n- **Malicious behavior:**  \n  No network activity, credential handling, or backdoors are detected or suggested.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:**  \n  The code's purpose is to customize versioning, which is common in packaging workflows. The dynamic import could be seen as unconventional but not harmful.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring & Justifications:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is appropriate.  \n- No evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign `obfuscated: 0`.  \n- The code is clear and readable, despite the unusual import placement.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- Most reports assign `securityRisk: 0` or `0.1`.  \n- Given the absence of external input, network activity, or code injection, the risk is minimal.  \n- The slightly non-standard import placement does not increase the risk significantly.\n\n#### Overall Risk:\n- The code is a typical setup script with a custom version scheme.  \n- The dynamic import is unconventional but benign.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No changes needed; the assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (to reflect the unconventional import but overall low risk)  \n\nThe code is a legitimate customization for package versioning with no security concerns. The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to provide an overall consolidated risk assessment or any further analysis?**",
