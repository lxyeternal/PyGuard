  "purpose": "Configure package setup with a custom version scheme using setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, setuptools, and setuptools_scm; call to setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; setup configuration is standard.",
  "flows": "setup() function uses custom version scheme; no data flow from external input to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The custom version scheme function imports guess_next_version within itself, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools with a custom version scheme function. It imports necessary modules, defines a function that determines the next version, and passes this function to setup(). The import inside the function is somewhat unconventional but not suspicious per se. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The overall structure appears legitimate for a build configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with a custom versioning scheme. No malicious intent or malicious behavior detected. The code does not contain obfuscation or suspicious activity.",
