{
  "purpose": "This module appears to define and export various classes, constants, and functions related to versioning, likely for a version control or package management system.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_config, _get_version_impl, _integration, _version_cls, version), and the module's own export list (__all__)",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks for untrusted data or code execution in the visible code. No external data processing, network operations, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code primarily imports and exposes components without processing untrusted input or executing external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code consists solely of import statements and an export list, with no dynamic code execution or secret handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports various internal components and defines a public API via __all__. It does not contain any data processing, user input handling, or operations that could lead to malicious behavior. The import statements reference internal modules, and the export list indicates a structured API for versioning components. No signs of malicious intent, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured module that serves as an API surface for version management components. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The lack of dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious code patterns confirms its safe nature.",
