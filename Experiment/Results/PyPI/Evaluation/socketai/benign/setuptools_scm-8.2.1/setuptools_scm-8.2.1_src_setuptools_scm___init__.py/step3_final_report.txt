{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an API module that imports internal version management components and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from internal module imports and the __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code contains only static import statements and an export list.",
  "flows": "The code flows from internal module imports to the __all__ export list; no dynamic data flows or external data handling are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, static, and contains no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module that imports internal components related to version management and exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence, and assign zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The structure is typical for a package's API layer, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API module with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
