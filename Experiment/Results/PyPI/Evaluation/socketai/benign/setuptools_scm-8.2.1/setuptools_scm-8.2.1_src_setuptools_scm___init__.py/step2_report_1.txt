  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports agree that the code is a straightforward module that imports internal components and exposes them via `__all__`. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data processing. The code is static, well-structured, and typical for a package's API layer.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Malware: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0\n\nThese are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports conclude no malware, obfuscation, or security risks, raising scores above 0.5 would be unjustified. The code does not perform any operations that could compromise security.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature. There is no evidence of malicious intent, code injection, or hidden payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll assessments are based on static analysis of the code snippet. No assumptions about external behavior or hidden code are made. The reports correctly interpret the code as non-malicious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a standard API module exposing internal components related to version management. It contains no dynamic code, no data processing, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns. All evidence points to benign, well-structured code with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis supply chain incident report indicates no malicious activity or security risks associated with this code snippet. The provided analysis and scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
