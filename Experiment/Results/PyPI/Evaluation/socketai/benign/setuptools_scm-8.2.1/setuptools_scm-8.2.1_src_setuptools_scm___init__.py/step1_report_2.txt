{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that manages versioning configurations and imports relevant functions and classes for version handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from its own module files, importing configuration variables, functions, and classes, but does not include external data input or user input sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output, network communication, or system modifications; it mainly defines and exports variables and functions.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; the code primarily organizes and exposes internal components.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The comments indicate deprecation and versioning management, which are normal for package maintenance.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package module that imports various internal components and exports them as part of a public API. It includes standard import statements, a list of exported symbols, and comments about deprecation. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. All code functions are related to package version management and configuration, with no network or system modifications observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign part of a version management package, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply organizes and exposes components for version control purposes.",
