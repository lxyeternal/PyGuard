{
  "purpose": "The code reads environment variables for version overrides, normalizes distribution names to prevent injection issues, and loads override data from TOML or inline maps, facilitating version management and configuration overrides.",
  "sources": "Environment variables such as 'SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION', 'SETUPTOOLS_SCM_OVERRIDES', and their variants based on distribution names.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables themselves; no data flows to external systems or network sinks; data is read locally for configuration purposes.",
  "flows": "The functions retrieve environment variables, normalize distribution names, and load override data, passing data to version.meta or load_toml_or_inline_map functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, primarily handling environment variables for version control and configuration overrides. It normalizes distribution names to prevent injection issues and loads override data safely. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or network activity is present. The use of environment variables is standard practice for configuration management, and the functions are simple and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving legitimate purposes in version management and configuration overrides. No malicious intent or obfuscation is present. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to environment variable manipulation, which is a common and accepted practice. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical configuration-related risks.",
