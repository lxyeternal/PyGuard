  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the logic, and ensuring the scores align with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's role in reading environment variables for version overrides, with normalization of distribution names, and loading override data.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious activity detected. The code is straightforward and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; environment variables are used for version overrides, with normalization.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious patterns or unsafe code. Use of environment variables is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — justified, considering environment variable reliance.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes environment variable usage for version management.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious activity or obfuscation. Environment variables are standard for configuration.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears benign.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores align well.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Properly states environment variables influence versioning.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity detected; standard configuration pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior identified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's role.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity; environment variables are used as intended.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and straightforward.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Malware Score:** All are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is clear.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0, but justified due to reliance on environment variables which, if compromised, could influence versioning—though this is standard practice.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0; code is transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2–0.3 seems reasonable, reflecting the typical risk associated with environment variable reliance but not indicating malicious intent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to environment variable manipulation potential, but no actual malicious activity)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign utility for version management via environment variables and configuration files. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present, and the scores in the reports are consistent with this assessment.",
