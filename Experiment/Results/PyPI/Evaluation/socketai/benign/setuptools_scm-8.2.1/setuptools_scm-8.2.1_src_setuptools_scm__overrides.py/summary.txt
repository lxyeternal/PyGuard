  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving legitimate purposes in version management and configuration overrides. No malicious intent or obfuscation is present. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to environment variable manipulation, which is a common and accepted practice. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical configuration-related risks."
