  "purpose": "Configuration management for versioning, path resolution, and reading pyproject.toml files with validation and warnings.",
  "sources": "Path manipulations, regex compilation, environment variables, and file reading functions.",
  "sinks": "Path joins, regex compilation, warnings, and logs; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input data from configuration files or user input flows into path handling and regex compilation, with validation and warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration handling, including path validation, regex compilation with validation, and warning issuance. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscated constructs are present. The use of warnings and validation indicates cautious handling of user input. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured configuration module with no malicious intent or malware. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to path handling, which is validated. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero, with a low risk score of 0.2 reflecting cautious handling of user input but no active threats.",
