      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented TOML serialization utility with no malicious intent or behavior. It supports various data types and extensions but does not process untrusted input in a way that could cause security issues. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the risk score is minimal, reflecting its utility nature. Overall, the code poses no security threat."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, controlled extension of the 'tomli' library for parsing TOML data with custom inline table handling. There is no malicious intent, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and justified given the controlled monkey patching of a private attribute."
