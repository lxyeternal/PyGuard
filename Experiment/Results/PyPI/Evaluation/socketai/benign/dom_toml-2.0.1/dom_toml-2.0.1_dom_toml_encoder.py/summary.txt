  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented TOML serialization utility with no malicious intent or behavior. It supports various data types and extensions but does not process untrusted input in a way that could cause security issues. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the risk score is minimal, reflecting its utility nature. Overall, the code poses no security threat."
