  "purpose": "Utility functions for serializing and deserializing TOML data, including file I/O operations.",
  "sources": "Reading input strings in 'loads', reading filenames in 'load', and data passed to 'dumps' and 'dump'.",
  "sinks": "File writing in 'dump' via 'write_clean', and data returned by 'loads' and 'dumps'.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into 'dumps' and 'loads' functions; data is serialized/deserialized; in 'dump', data flows into file write operation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward serialization/deserialization functions with proper type checks and file handling. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The file I/O operations are standard and safe. No signs of obfuscation or backdoors. The code relies on established third-party libraries, and the logic is clear and well-structured. The security risk is minimal, limited to typical file operations, and no external communication or data exfiltration is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for TOML data handling. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
