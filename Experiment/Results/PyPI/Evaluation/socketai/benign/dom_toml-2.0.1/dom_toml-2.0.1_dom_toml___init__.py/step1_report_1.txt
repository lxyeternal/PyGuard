{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for encoding and decoding TOML data, including reading from and writing to files.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters (strings, mappings, file paths) and environment variables for file handling.",
  "sinks": "Writing data to files via PathPlus.write_clean and converting data to strings for output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through functions, possibly via encoder/decoder instances, and is written to files or returned as strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns are present. Usage of standard library and third-party modules appears benign. No code obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for encoding and decoding TOML data, with standard practices such as type checking, object instantiation, and file handling. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious activities are evident. The usage of third-party libraries is consistent with their intended use. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code flows are detected. The code operates solely on provided data and files, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for TOML serialization/deserialization without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It follows standard patterns for safe data handling and file I/O.",
