{
  "purpose": "Provide functions to encode and decode TOML data, and read/write TOML data to/from files.",
  "sources": "Reads input strings in 'loads' and file contents in 'load', and uses parameters such as 'encoder' and 'decoder'.",
  "sinks": "Writes data to files in 'dump', returns encoded strings in 'dumps', and processes input parameters in 'loads' and 'load'.",
  "flows": "Input data or file contents (sources) are processed through encoding/decoding functions and written to files or returned as strings (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate. No unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions for handling TOML data with proper type checks and use of external libraries. It employs standard patterns for encoding and file I/O. No signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code does not include any dynamic execution, obfuscated constructs, or secret handling. It relies on established third-party libraries and standard Python practices.",
  "conclusion": "This module performs legitimate serialization/deserialization of TOML data with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe for use in a project context.",
