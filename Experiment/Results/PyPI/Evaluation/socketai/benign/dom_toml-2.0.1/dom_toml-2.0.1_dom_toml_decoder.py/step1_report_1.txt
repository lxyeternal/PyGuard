{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes for decoding TOML data, with options for inline table representations using either a subclassed dictionary or a standard dictionary.",
  "sources": "Input string parameter 's' in the 'loads' methods of 'TomlDecoder' and 'TomlPureDecoder'.",
  "sinks": "Return value of 'loads' methods, which outputs parsed TOML data. No untrusted data is directly written or sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input string 's' -> Parsing functions (via 'tomli.loads') -> Output dictionary with TOML data.",
  "anomalies": "Temporary overriding of 'tomli._parser.parse_inline_table' function in 'TomlDecoder' class, which is restored afterward. This pattern modifies a private module attribute but does not introduce malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily acts as a wrapper around the 'tomli' library, customizing inline table parsing behavior via function overriding. It correctly restores the original function after use, avoiding persistent modification. No code injection, network access, or data exfiltration is present. The class structure is straightforward and adheres to standard patterns. The dynamic override of a private parser function is notable but appears to be a legitimate customization, not malicious. No obfuscation or hidden behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate TOML decoding utility with a minor customization for inline table parsing. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
