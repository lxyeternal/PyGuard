{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes for decoding TOML data, with a customization to handle inline tables differently by monkey-patching an internal parser function in the 'tomli' library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the string parameter 's' passed to the 'loads' methods in both classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data exfiltration points; the code solely processes data in-memory.",
  "flows": "The source is the input string 's'; the flow involves temporarily overriding 'tomli._parser.parse_inline_table' to wrap inline tables into a custom dict, then restoring the original function before parsing the input.",
  "anomalies": "Monkey-patching a private attribute ('tomli._parser.parse_inline_table') is unconventional but controlled; no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'tomli' or 'tomllib' based on Python version, defines a subclass of dict for inline tables, and two decoder classes. 'TomlDecoder' overrides the internal 'parse_inline_table' function temporarily to return inline tables as 'InlineTableDict', ensuring the original function is restored afterward. 'TomlPureDecoder' simply calls 'tomli.loads'. The patching is a controlled extension for customizing inline table parsing. No external network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are detected. The monkey patching of a private attribute is a known pattern for customization, not malicious. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, controlled extension of the 'tomli' library for parsing TOML data with custom inline table handling. There is no malicious intent, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and justified given the controlled monkey patching of a private attribute.",
