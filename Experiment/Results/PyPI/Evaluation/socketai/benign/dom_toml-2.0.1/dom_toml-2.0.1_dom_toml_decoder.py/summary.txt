  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, controlled extension of the 'tomli' library for parsing TOML data with custom inline table handling. There is no malicious intent, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and justified given the controlled monkey patching of a private attribute."
