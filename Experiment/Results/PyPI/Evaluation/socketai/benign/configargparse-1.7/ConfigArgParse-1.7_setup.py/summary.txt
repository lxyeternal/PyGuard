  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a typical setup and testing utility with local report serving capabilities. No malicious activity or supply chain sabotage is evident. The main security consideration is to avoid using `os.system()` with untrusted inputs, but in this script, commands are static and controlled. Overall, the security risk is low, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero."
