{
  "purpose": "Minimal boilerplate headers with no executable code or logic.",
  "sources": "Shebang line and encoding declaration comments",
  "sinks": "None, as there is no executable code or data flow",
  "flows": "None, no data or control flow present",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, no suspicious or unusual constructs, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a shebang and encoding comment, indicating a script header. No functions, data handling, or logic are present. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are detectable. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless boilerplate with no malicious or security concerns. The existing scores are accurate and do not require adjustment.",
