  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code snippets contain only shebang and encoding declaration lines, with no executable logic, data sources, sinks, or flows. They are boilerplate headers, standard in Python scripts, and do not perform any operations or contain any data handling.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Content**  \nSince there is no code beyond comments, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or anomalies. The reports uniformly conclude that these snippets are benign.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasoning**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of code or obfuscation techniques.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. There is no malicious behavior or payload in these snippets.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the lack of executable code or potential vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Logical Errors in Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as harmless boilerplate headers. No assumptions are made beyond the visible code, and no unwarranted suspicion is introduced.\n\n5. **Risk Scores Justification**  \nSince the code is purely boilerplate with no executable content, assigning a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified. The minimal code does not pose any security threat.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment & Final Scores**  \nGiven the uniformity and correctness of the reports, I agree with their assessments. They correctly identify the absence of malicious or obfuscated content and assign appropriate scores.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code snippets are harmless headers with no security concerns. No adjustments needed.",
