  "purpose": "The provided code is a shebang and encoding declaration, indicating it is intended as a Python script.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are present in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs in the provided code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a shebang line and a UTF-8 encoding comment; no executable logic or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal, consisting solely of a shebang and encoding comment, which are standard and benign in Python scripts. There are no functions, variables, input/output operations, or external calls that could be malicious. Due to the lack of executable code, there are no security concerns or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical header for a Python script and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe based on this snippet alone.",
