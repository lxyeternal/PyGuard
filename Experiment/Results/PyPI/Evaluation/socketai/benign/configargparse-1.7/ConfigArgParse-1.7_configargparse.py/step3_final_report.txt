  "purpose": "An extended argparse replacement supporting environment variables, multiple config formats (INI, YAML, TOML), and enhanced help formatting, with stream-based parsing and source tracking.",
  "sources": "Config files (INI, YAML, TOML), environment variables (via os.environ or auto prefix), command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "Internal configuration namespace, serialization for config output, no external communication",
  "flows": "Sources (files, env vars, CLI args) -> parsing functions -> internal namespace, optional serialization for writing configs",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected. Uses safe eval (ast.literal_eval), controlled dynamic imports, standard modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, feature-rich extension of argparse, designed for flexible configuration management. It safely parses multiple formats, merges sources, tracks origins, and supports writing configs. No network activity, no obfuscation, no malicious code. Exception handling and safe evals are used appropriately. The code's structure and modules are standard and well-documented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and flexible configuration utility with no malicious intent or behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
