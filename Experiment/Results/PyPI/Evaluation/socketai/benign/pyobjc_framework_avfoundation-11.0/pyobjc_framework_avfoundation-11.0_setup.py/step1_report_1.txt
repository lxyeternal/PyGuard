{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and configures the Python package 'pyobjc-framework-AVFoundation' for macOS, including defining extensions and dependencies.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), os.listdir('Modules'), import statements",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Reads __file__ path, scans 'Modules' directory, loads modules and sets up extensions; no data flows into external systems or untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations using setup() and Extension() from pyobjc_setup. It dynamically constructs dependencies and module paths based on the filesystem, which is typical for setup scripts. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The script only configures build parameters and dependencies for the package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script for a Python wrapper around the macOS AVFoundation framework. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements. All operations are related to packaging and configuration without any malicious intent or malicious payload.",
