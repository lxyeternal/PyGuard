{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging the pyobjc-framework-AVFoundation Python module, which provides wrappers for the AVFoundation framework on macOS.",
  "sources": "os and sys modules for environment and path handling, and package metadata including module source files and dependencies",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations or network interactions",
  "flows": "N/A - no untrusted data flow identified; setup configuration relies on local files and environment variables only",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. Use of standard packaging tools and structure is typical for Python extension modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and modifies sys.path, then defines package metadata and extension modules for building a Python package that wraps macOS system frameworks. It depends solely on local source files and standard dependencies. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code. The setup script conforms to standard practices for Python extension modules, with no obfuscated code, no network activity, or other malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python extension module related to AVFoundation. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no data leaks, and adheres to normal packaging conventions.",
