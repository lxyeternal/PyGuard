{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for building and installing Python wrappers for the macOS AVFoundation framework, using the pyobjc library.",
  "sources": "Imports from os, sys, and pyobjc_setup; reads directory contents with os.listdir; uses __doc__ for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing identified; no network, file, or system modification points present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python extension module, including setting up extensions with source files, link arguments, dependencies, and package metadata. It does not execute any untrusted data, nor does it perform network operations, file modifications beyond build configuration, or any system-altering actions. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical setup script conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard build configuration script for packaging Python bindings to the AVFoundation framework. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is safe and intended for legitimate use.",
