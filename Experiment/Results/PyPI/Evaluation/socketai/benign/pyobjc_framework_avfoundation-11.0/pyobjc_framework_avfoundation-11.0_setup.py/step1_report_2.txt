  "purpose": "Create Python bindings for the macOS AVFoundation framework using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "os, sys, pyobjc_setup, os.listdir, __file__, and __doc__",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous functions observed.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow from sources to sinks; setup and extension creation are static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation. The code appears to perform standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and the PyObjC setup tools to define a package configuration. It dynamically lists files in the 'Modules' directory to specify dependencies, which is a common practice in package setup. No input validation, user input, or network activity is present. No code executes untrusted data or external commands beyond standard build steps. The code appears to be a straightforward package wrapper with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging the AVFoundation framework bindings for macOS using PyObjC. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and purpose-specific.",
