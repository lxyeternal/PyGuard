{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging the pyobjc-framework-AVFoundation module on macOS, configuring extension modules and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Filesystem directory listing ('Modules' directory), module imports, and setup configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Filesystem listing flows into module dependency setup; no data flows into network or execution sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup operations with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: importing modules, dynamically listing module files, configuring extension modules with source files and link arguments, and setting dependencies. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network activity, or handle sensitive data. The use of 'os.listdir' is standard for dynamic dependency inclusion. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The code's purpose is clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python framework binding to macOS's AVFoundation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
