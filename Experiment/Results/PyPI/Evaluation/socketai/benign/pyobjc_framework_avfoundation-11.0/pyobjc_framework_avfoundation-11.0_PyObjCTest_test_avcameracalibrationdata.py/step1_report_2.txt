  "purpose": "Unit testing for AVFoundation's AVCameraCalibrationData methods and type checks on macOS 10.13+.",
  "sources": "Import statements: AVFoundation, PyObjCTools, and objc modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows identified; test methods call property accessors and assertion methods.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists of standard unit test assertions for method signatures and types.",
  "analysis": "The code is a test suite verifying the return types of specific properties (intrinsicMatrix and extrinsicMatrix) of AVCameraCalibrationData. It uses standard testing frameworks and macOS APIs without any code execution, data manipulation, or network activity. No suspicious or malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic are present. The code appears to serve purely for validation purposes in a development or testing environment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply checks the type signatures of specific properties in a macOS framework. There is no evidence of malware, data leakage, or sabotage.",
