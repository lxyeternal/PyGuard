  "purpose": "A unit test verifying the data types of AVFoundation.AVCameraCalibrationData properties (intrinsicMatrix and extrinsicMatrix).",
  "sources": "Access to AVFoundation.AVCameraCalibrationData properties, specifically intrinsicMatrix and extrinsicMatrix.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code performs static assertions only.",
  "flows": "The code accesses properties and asserts their types; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward type assertions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured unit test verifying property types of system API classes. It performs no data manipulation, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The assertions are correct, and the code's purpose is purely for API validation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The slight elevation of securityRisk to 0.1 in one report is marginal and can be considered acceptable, but ideally should be 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward unit test with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs static type assertions on system API properties and poses no threat. The scores assigned are appropriate, with a minor adjustment to set the securityRisk score to 0 for full consistency.",
