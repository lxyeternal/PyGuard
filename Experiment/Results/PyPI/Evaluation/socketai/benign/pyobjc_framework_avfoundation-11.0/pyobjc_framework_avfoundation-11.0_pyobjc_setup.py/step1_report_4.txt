{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the PyObjC framework, managing package configuration, build, testing, and installation procedures.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (CFLAGS, PATH), invokes subprocesses (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), reads files (PKG-INFO, SDKSettings.plist, headers), and imports modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess to execute system commands, reads and loads files (plist, headers), modifies sys.path, and dynamically imports modules.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or system commands influence subprocess outputs; subprocess outputs influence SDK and compiler configurations; file reads provide build info; dynamic imports can execute arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Uses standard subprocess and file operations, typical for setup scripts. No obfuscated code or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs package setup and build management with subprocess calls to retrieve system info, and manipulates sys.path and modules for testing. These are typical for build scripts. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. It relies heavily on system calls and file operations common in setup tools. No anomalies or malware indicators identified.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup and build script for the PyObjC package, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs environment inspection, file manipulation, and module imports as expected for a build configuration script.",
