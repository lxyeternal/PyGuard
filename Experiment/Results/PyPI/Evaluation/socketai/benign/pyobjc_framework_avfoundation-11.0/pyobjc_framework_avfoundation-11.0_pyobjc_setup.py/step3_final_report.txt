  "purpose": "Build and test setup script for PyObjC, performing environment detection, SDK and compiler configuration, and orchestrating tests.",
  "sources": "System commands (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), environment variables, filesystem reads, dynamic module imports, package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Execution of system commands, reading/writing files, importing modules dynamically, modifying sys.path and environment.",
  "flows": "System info influences build flags and SDK selection; environment variables and system commands guide configuration; dynamic imports load test modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess calls and dynamic imports could be exploited if environment is compromised, but no malicious intent or payloads are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard build and test setup script for PyObjC, executing system introspection, configuring build options, and orchestrating tests. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Use of subprocess and dynamic imports are typical but should be run in trusted environments. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured build and test setup script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score is appropriate given its environment-dependent operations. The assessments and scores are justified and accurate.",
