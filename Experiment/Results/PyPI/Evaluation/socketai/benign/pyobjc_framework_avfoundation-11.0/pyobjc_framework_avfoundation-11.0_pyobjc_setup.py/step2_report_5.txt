  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a build setup for PyObjC, executing system commands (`sw_vers`, `clang`, `xcrun`), reading SDK info, and dynamically importing test modules. No malicious activity is detected; it performs environment introspection and build configuration.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious behavior observed.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — reasonable, considering the use of system commands and dynamic imports but nothing malicious.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it details environment detection, SDK info retrieval, and test setup. It highlights standard subprocess usage and environment reliance.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate; no malicious activity.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — acceptable; the only concern is subprocess and environment variable use, which is typical.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code clarity is maintained.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on environment detection, SDK and compiler validation, and build configuration. No suspicious patterns or malicious code are found.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct; no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — appropriate, given the standard build environment interactions.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing environment inspection, subprocess calls, and module imports for setup. No malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — clear code.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard build setup involving environment variables, subprocess calls, and module imports. No signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — fitting.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — straightforward code.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior. The code performs system introspection and build setup, typical for such scripts.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), reflecting the use of system commands and dynamic imports but no actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and well-structured.\n\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — low, due to reliance on system commands and environment variables, which is standard in build scripts but warrants cautious trust in the environment.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' assessments are consistent and reasonable. The code appears to be a legitimate build and setup script for PyObjC, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores reflect the low security risk appropriately.",
