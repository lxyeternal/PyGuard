  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a setup script for PyObjC, performing system introspection, build configuration, and testing. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Issues present in code?** No. The code's activities are standard for build scripts.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable given the system command executions and dynamic module handling, which are typical in build scripts.\n- **Justification for scores:** No malicious intent; system commands are standard for environment detection.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment. The low risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing environment detection, SDK, and compiler validation, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Issues present in code?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. These are appropriate considering subprocess calls and environment reliance.\n- **Justification:** Standard build environment setup, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a build setup script with environment detection and build configuration.\n- **Issues present in code?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Slightly lower risk, reflecting standard practices.\n- **Justification:** No malicious code; subprocess calls are for system info.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, standard setup script activities.\n- **Issues present in code?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Consistent with the previous assessments.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—system info retrieval, build configuration, no malicious behavior.\n- **Issues present in code?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Reasonable.\n- **Justification:** Standard build script behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's activities—system introspection, environment setup, dynamic module import, and test execution are typical for build scripts.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0, but low (0.1-0.2), which is reasonable given the use of subprocess and environment reliance but no malicious intent.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (standard build environment setup, minimal risk)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and accurately score the potential risks. The code is a typical build and test setup script with no signs of malicious activity.",
