{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying constants, enum types, and method signatures for AVFoundation classes related to audio environment nodes.",
  "sources": "Static access to class attributes, constants, and method signatures within the AVFoundation framework.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, user input, or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Assertions verifying expected values and method behaviors without data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; standard validation tests.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static assertions on framework constants and method signatures, serving as validation for SDK components. It involves no dynamic code, external inputs, network activity, or data leaks. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and typical for SDK validation, indicating benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test suite verifying AVFoundation constants and methods. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk detected. The scores are appropriately set to 0 for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk.",
