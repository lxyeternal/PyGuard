  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a set of unit tests verifying constants, enum types, and method signatures within AVFoundation.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data, user input, or network activity. The flow is static assertions.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward test suite for SDK validation. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on verifying constants and method signatures with no data handling or external interactions.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Again, confirms constants and method signatures without any external data or dynamic behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Same pattern: testing framework constants, enums, and method signatures.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Consistent with previous, verifying API interfaces without external data or malicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe benign, assertion-based unit tests for system SDK APIs.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; no code indicates malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risk:** None, as the code is purely for validation of constants and method signatures.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is entirely standard for SDK validation testing.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.\n- The tests serve to verify that the framework's constants and methods are correctly defined, which is typical and safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain report indicates a benign, well-structured test suite with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
