  "purpose": "Unit tests for AVFoundation audio environment node functionalities using PyObjCTools.",
  "sources": "Imports from AVFoundation and PyObjCTools.TestSupport, method calls accessing AVFoundation constants and properties.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or data flows leading to potential leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of tests for known system APIs and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite that verifies enum types, constants, and method behaviors related to AVFoundation's audio environment nodes. It imports system frameworks, checks enum values, and verifies method signatures with expected return types and argument attributes. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, data handling from untrusted sources, or malicious behavior. The code is structured and appears to be standard testing code for system APIs.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign, standard test suite for AVFoundation API components. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It is safe and solely intended for verifying the correctness of API interfaces.",
