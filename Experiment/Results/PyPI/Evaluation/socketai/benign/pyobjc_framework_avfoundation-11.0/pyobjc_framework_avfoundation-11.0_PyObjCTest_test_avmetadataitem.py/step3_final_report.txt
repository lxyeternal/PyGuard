  "purpose": "The code is a static test suite verifying method argument signatures and callback types for AVFoundation's AVMetadataItem class across different OS versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for AVFoundation and testing modules; method calls verifying argument attributes and callback signatures.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data transmission.",
  "flows": "The code performs static assertions on method signatures; no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static API validation test suite, verifying method signatures and argument properties without executing any logic involving external data or system modifications. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero. The code does not contain malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation, and the purpose is solely to ensure API correctness. The high confidence in this assessment is supported by the static, straightforward nature of the code and the consistent reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API validation test suite with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of zero for malware and obfuscation are appropriate, and the overall security risk is negligible. No further action is necessary.",
