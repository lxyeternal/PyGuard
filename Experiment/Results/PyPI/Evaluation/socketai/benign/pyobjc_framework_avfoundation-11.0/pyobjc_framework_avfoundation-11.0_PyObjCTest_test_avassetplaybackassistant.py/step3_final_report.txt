  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying constants and method signatures in the AVFoundation framework, specifically for different OS versions.",
  "sources": "Reads constants and method signatures from AVFoundation; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Static checks of constants and method signatures; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward API validation tests with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version-specific assertions on AVFoundation constants and method signatures, using standard testing functions. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or contain any malicious code. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, with high confidence. The security risk score is also 0, indicating no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test suite for AVFoundation API validation. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with its purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
