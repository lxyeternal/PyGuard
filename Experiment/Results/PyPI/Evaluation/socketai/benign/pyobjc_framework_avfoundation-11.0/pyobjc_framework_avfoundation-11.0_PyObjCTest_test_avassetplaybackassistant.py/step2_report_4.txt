  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward unit test suite for AVFoundation constants and method signatures.\n   - It performs OS version-based checks, asserting types of constants and method argument signatures.\n   - There are no data inputs, network operations, or data manipulations.\n\n2. **Potential Security Concerns**:\n   - No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.\n   - The code's purpose is to verify API correctness and compatibility, not to process or handle external data.\n\n3. **Malware and Obfuscation**:\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0.\n   - The code is clean, well-structured, and uses standard testing practices.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - The reports' scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - The highest confidence scores (1.0) align with the clear, non-malicious intent.\n   - The risk scores are appropriately low (0), indicating no security threat.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final Assessment**:\nGiven the evidence, I concur with the existing evaluations. The code is a benign, standard unit test suite for AVFoundation API validation with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code poses no security threat and functions solely as a compatibility test.",
