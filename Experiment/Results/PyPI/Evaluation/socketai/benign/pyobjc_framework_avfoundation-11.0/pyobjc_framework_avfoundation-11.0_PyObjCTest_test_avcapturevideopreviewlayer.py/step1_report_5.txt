{
  "purpose": "The code is a test case to verify the existence of the AVFoundation.AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer class.",
  "sources": "import AVFoundation, which loads the AVFoundation framework, and the test class that references the AVFoundation.AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer class.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks; the code does not process or transmit data. It only references a class.",
  "flows": "The import loads the framework, and the class reference checks for class existence; no data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a system framework and performs a simple check for a class within that framework. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or other potentially malicious actions. The structure is minimal and typical for framework class existence verification. No suspicious or malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward test to verify the presence of a specific AVFoundation class. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
