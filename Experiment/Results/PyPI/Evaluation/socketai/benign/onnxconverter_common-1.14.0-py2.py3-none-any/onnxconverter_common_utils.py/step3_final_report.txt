  "purpose": "Utility functions for dependency checks, data type validation, and internal package metadata retrieval.",
  "sources": "Import statements for optional dependencies; internal variables (__producer__, __domain__, etc.) imported dynamically from the package.",
  "sinks": "No external data flow, network activity, or data exfiltration points present.",
  "flows": "Dependency check functions import modules; internal variables accessed via dynamic import; data validation functions process input data locally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard try-except for optional dependencies; straightforward data conversions.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises dependency verification functions, data type validation routines, and internal metadata accessors. All functions perform simple import checks, type assertions, or variable retrievals. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or external data handling are present. The internal variables are standard package metadata, accessed via dynamic import, which is common practice. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks are evident. The code is well-structured, straightforward, and intended solely for utility purposes within a larger framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It functions as a utility module for dependency verification and data validation, with standard practices and no suspicious patterns. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and very low security risk score (~0.0-0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
