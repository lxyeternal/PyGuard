  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It functions as a utility module for dependency verification and data validation, with standard practices and no suspicious patterns. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and very low security risk score (~0.0-0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
