{
  "purpose": "This script parses and analyzes profiling results from onnxruntime, generating reports on node, op_type, or step durations, and outputs results in console or CSV format.",
  "sources": "File input specified by command-line argument (profile_path in read_raw_entries), reading JSON data; command-line arguments for query filtering.",
  "sinks": "Writing output to console or CSV file; potential for writing large or malicious content if inputs are crafted maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input JSON data -> Parsing and filtering -> Data processing functions -> Output to console or CSV",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs; extensive command-line argument parsing and query filtering are typical features of data analysis scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily processes JSON profiling data from onnxruntime, extracting specific performance metrics. It includes input validation, filtering, sorting, and output formatting. No network operations, system modifications, or suspicious behaviors are present. The script's structure is standard for data analysis tools, and it does not perform any malicious actions or data exfiltration. It relies on user-supplied input and output files, with no embedded or obfuscated malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate profiling data analysis tool with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It safely processes profiling data and outputs formatted reports without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
