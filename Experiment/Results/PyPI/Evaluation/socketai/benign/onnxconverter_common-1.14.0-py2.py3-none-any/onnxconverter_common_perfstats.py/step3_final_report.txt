  "purpose": "A script for parsing profiling results from onnxruntime, outputting total durations grouped by node, op type, or step, either to console or CSV.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON profiling data from a specified file.",
  "sinks": "Outputs processed data to console or CSV; no external network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Reads JSON data -> processes and filters entries -> outputs results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard JSON parsing, data aggregation, and formatted output. It includes filtering based on user queries and supports CSV export. No network activity, no code injection, and no obfuscation are present. The scoring of malware as 0, obfuscation as 0, and security risk as 0.1 in some reports is consistent with the benign nature of the script, which handles data without malicious intent. The slight elevation in security risk reflects potential resource exhaustion if inputs are maliciously crafted, but this is typical for data processing scripts and does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward profiling data parser with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The existing scores are appropriate; minor security risk scores (0.1) are justified by potential resource concerns but do not imply malicious activity.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
