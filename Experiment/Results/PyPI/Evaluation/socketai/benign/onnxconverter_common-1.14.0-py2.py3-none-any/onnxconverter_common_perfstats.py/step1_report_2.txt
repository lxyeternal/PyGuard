{
  "purpose": "The script analyzes and summarizes profiling results from onnxruntime, outputting data to console or CSV based on user-specified options.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from a JSON profiling file specified by the user.",
  "sinks": "Opens and reads the JSON profiling file; writes output to console or CSV file.",
  "flows": "Reads profiling data from file -> processes data into summaries -> outputs summaries to console or CSV.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected. The code primarily handles data processing and output formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code parses JSON profiling data, filters and computes summary statistics such as total durations per node, op_type, or step. It supports query-based filtering and output formatting. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are detected. The code performs standard file I/O, data processing, and console/CSV output without any suspicious operations or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate utility for analyzing profiling data from onnxruntime. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. Its functions are limited to data parsing, filtering, aggregation, and output formatting, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
