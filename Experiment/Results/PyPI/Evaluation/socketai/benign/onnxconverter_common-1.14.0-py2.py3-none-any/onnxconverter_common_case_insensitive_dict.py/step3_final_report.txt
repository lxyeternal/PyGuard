{
  "purpose": "A standard implementation of a case-insensitive dictionary wrapper that preserves original key casing for display and iteration.",
  "sources": "Input data during initialization, dictionary operations such as update, setitem, delitem, and iteration.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal data stored in self._dict, accessed via normalized keys.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input into self._dict with lowercase keys; accessed via __getitem__, __setitem__, and iteration.",
  "anomalies": "The copy() method returns CaseInsensitiveDict(self._dict.values()), which may not correctly duplicate the internal state, potentially leading to inconsistent behavior but not security issues.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation of a case-insensitive dictionary. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The only minor flaw is in the copy() method, which does not produce an exact duplicate of the object, but this is a bug, not a security vulnerability. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are detected. The code's structure and behavior are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility class with no malicious intent or security risks. Minor implementation issues exist but do not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.05), reflecting minor bugs rather than vulnerabilities.",
