{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the entry point and utility aggregator for the onnxconverter-common package, providing various imports and version information related to ONNX model optimization and conversion.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules within the package, version and author metadata, and licensing comments.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external communication. No functions that handle user input, network operations, or sensitive data processing.",
  "flows": "The code primarily initializes module metadata and imports internal modules; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. License comments and import statements are standard.",
  "analysis": "The script contains license and metadata comments, versioning, author info, and multiple import statements from local modules. All import statements are static and safe. No code execution, input handling, or external communication present. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or main module file, focused on organizing exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a package initializer and utility importer. No malicious intent or suspicious activity detected. It adheres to standard practices without any signs of malware or security risks.",
