  "purpose": "Package initialization and utility setup for onnxconverter-common, importing internal modules and setting metadata.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules, setting metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static imports and metadata assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') which can obscure imported symbols but are common in package init files.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package initializer with static imports and metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risks. The wildcard imports are noted but are typical in such scripts and do not indicate malicious intent. The overall assessment aligns with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the static, straightforward structure of the code.",
