{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for converting tree-based models (classifiers and regressors) into attribute pairs for serialization or further processing.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code constructs internal data structures for tree nodes and appends data to them, but no external flow of untrusted data occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The code structure and variable usage are standard for model serialization. No obfuscated code or hidden logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to generate attribute dictionaries for tree classifiers and regressors, and functions to add nodes and entire trees to these structures. It operates solely on provided data structures and parameters, with no external input handling or external data flow. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network operations, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All operations are typical for model conversion. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign utility module for converting tree models into structured attribute pairs, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
