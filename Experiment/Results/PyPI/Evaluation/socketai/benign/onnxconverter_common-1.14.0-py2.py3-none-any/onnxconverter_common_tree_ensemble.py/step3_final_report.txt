  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting tree-based models into attribute dictionaries for serialization or export.",
  "sources": "Model data structures such as node values, features, thresholds, and children indices.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; data is processed internally within data structures.",
  "flows": "Model data is read from input structures, normalized if necessary, and appended to attribute dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward functions to initialize attribute dictionaries for classifiers and regressors, add nodes with normalization of leaf weights, and assemble entire trees into attribute pairs. It operates solely on model data, normalizing leaf counts to probabilities, and appending relevant node information. There are no external data sources, network calls, or system modifications. The logic is standard for model serialization, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for model serialization, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are accurate and justified.",
