{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions for constructing, manipulating, and executing ONNX computational graphs, including model loading, saving, and runtime inference.",
  "sources": "Model loading functions (onnx.load_model), model serialization (onnx.save_model), function arguments extraction, tensor operations, and graph construction routines.",
  "sinks": "Model serialization/deserialization, runtime inference calls, and tensor operations that process data within the framework.",
  "flows": "Input data or models are loaded or passed into functions; tensors are created or manipulated; models are built or loaded; inference is performed; models are saved or exported.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, network activity, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard ML utility library for ONNX models, involving graph construction, model serialization, and inference. It uses common libraries (onnx, numpy) and adheres to typical patterns for such frameworks. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's content and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured ONNX utility library with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. Its security risk is minimal, primarily due to the potential risks associated with loading untrusted models, but the code itself is safe.",
