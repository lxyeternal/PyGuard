  "purpose": "Utility functions for creating and configuring ONNX models, managing operator set versions, and adding metadata properties.",
  "sources": "Model input graph, imported operator set pairs, target default opset, optional metadata properties, and utility functions for producer/version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external communication, or file/network operations; primarily manipulates in-memory model objects.",
  "flows": "Reads model opset imports and metadata; sets model properties; validates and updates operator set versions; adds metadata; outputs configured ONNX model object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Version handling and warnings are standard and appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard model creation and configuration tasks using well-known libraries. It manages operator set versions, adds metadata, and sets model properties with validation. No external data fetching, network activity, or code injection observed. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The version management and warning mechanisms are typical for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility for ONNX model creation and configuration. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified and appropriate given its purpose. Overall, the code is safe for deployment and use.",
