  "purpose": "A comprehensive set of helper functions for constructing ONNX computational graphs, handling various operators, version compatibilities, and initializers.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, input variable names, and initializers added to the container for graph node creation.",
  "sinks": "Generated ONNX nodes and initializers within the graph; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input variables and parameters flow into node creation functions, resulting in graph nodes and initializers that define the model structure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected; code adheres to standard ONNX graph construction practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured utility library for ONNX model graph building, with version-aware handling of operators, initializers for constants, and standard node creation. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The functions do not perform external communication, data exfiltration, or runtime code execution beyond static graph construction. The code's purpose is static, deterministic, and aligns with common practices for model serialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for ONNX model graph creation, with no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks.",
