  "purpose": "Setup script for building a Python package with C++ extensions, including platform-specific compiler flags and a cleanup command.",
  "sources": "Static list of C++ source files in 'cpp_src/' directory, platform information via sys.platform.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network calls, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script only configures build parameters and cleans build artifacts.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for compiling C++ extensions with Python. It conditionally sets compiler flags based on platform, specifies source files, and defines a clean command to remove build directories. No external input, network activity, or malicious code is present. The structure and content are typical for such build scripts, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, straightforward, and intended solely for building a Python package with C++ extensions. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
