{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to build and set up a Python package with C++ extension modules using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'sys' module, 'shutil' for directory removal, and the specified C++ source files listed in the 'sources' array.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any obvious sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system command executions that could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading system platform info to set compilation args, compiling C++ sources into a Python extension, and optionally cleaning build directories. There are no untrusted data flows or external input processing involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The script primarily configures build settings and cleanup routines.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks for a Python package involving C++ extensions. It conditionally sets compiler arguments based on platform, specifies source files, and defines a clean command to remove build artifacts. There are no signs of malicious code, external data handling, or security-critical operations. It appears to be a typical build configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup script for building a Python package with C++ extensions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on its content.",
