  "purpose": "Setup script for building and packaging a Python extension module with C++ sources using setuptools.",
  "sources": "File paths in the 'sources' list, including C++ source files in 'cpp_src/' directory.",
  "sinks": "No explicit untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable manipulation is present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the script solely orchestrates compilation and packaging processes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets detected. The code performs standard setup operations. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines source files for C++ extension compilation. It configures compiler arguments based on platform, sets up extension modules, and defines a clean command to remove build artifacts. The setup() function calls with package and extension info are standard and do not perform any suspicious actions. No network, data exfiltration, or environment variable misuse observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for compiling a C++ extension module in a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard build configuration.",
