  "purpose": "Setup script for compiling and installing a Python package with C++ extensions.",
  "sources": "The script reads platform information, compilation flags, and lists C++ source files for building extensions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; no network, file, or system modification based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; configuration is static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines build configuration for a Python package using C++ extensions with conditional compilation flags based on the platform. It includes a clean command to remove build artifacts. All source files are static, and the package setup is straightforward. No input/output operations with untrusted data, no network activity, or system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for building a Python package with C++ extensions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this script.",
