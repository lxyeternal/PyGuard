{
  "purpose": "This script is used to set up and compile a Python package that includes C++ extensions, specifically compiling multiple C++ source files into a Python module.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the sys.platform (for platform detection) and from the list of source files specified in the 'sources' list for compilation.",
  "sinks": "The sources are used for compiling C++ extensions, which is a normal behavior. No untrusted data flows or data leaks are evident in the code.",
  "flows": "The code reads platform info to determine compilation args, then compiles C++ sources into a Python extension module. No untrusted input is passed to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code solely handles setup and compilation procedures. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for building a Python package with C++ extensions. It dynamically chooses compile flags based on platform, defines source files, and provides a clean command to remove build artifacts. All operations are typical for such setup scripts, with no suspicious logic, data leaks, or malicious activities evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for compiling C++ extensions into a Python package. No malicious intent or security risks are detected based on the code provided.",
