  "purpose": "Set up and compile C++ extension modules for a Python package, including a clean command for build artifacts.",
  "sources": "N/A (no input/output reading; only static file references and setup configuration).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no untrusted data handling or network operations).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow involving untrusted sources).",
  "anomalies": "Standard setup script with no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; no unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script that uses setuptools to compile C++ extension modules. It specifies source files, platform-specific compile options, and defines a clean command for removing build artifacts. No input, output, or external data processing is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The script focuses solely on building extensions and cleaning build directories.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard build setup script for a Python package with C++ extensions, containing no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
