  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports everything from a local module `_low_index`.\n- Defines a version string `'1.2.1'`.\n- Provides a function `version()` returning the version string.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Purpose:** Basic version reporting and import.\n\n**Analysis & Findings:**\n- No malicious behavior detected.\n- Importing `_low_index` could be benign or malicious if `_low_index` contains malicious code, but nothing in this snippet indicates malicious intent.\n- The version function is straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Scores:**\n- malware: 0 (correct)\n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- risk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Purpose:** Define version string and import components.\n\n**Analysis & Findings:**\n- Use of `from ._low_index import *` can obscure what is imported.\n- Wildcard import could hide malicious code if `_low_index` is malicious, but from this snippet alone, there's no evidence.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** Slight caution due to wildcard import, but overall benign.\n\n**Scores:**\n- malware: 0 (correct)\n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- risk: 0.2 (a slight risk due to import style; acceptable)\n\n**Recommendation:** The risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Purpose:** Version info and local module import.\n\n**Analysis & Findings:**\n- Similar to previous, straightforward.\n- No malicious activity or suspicious code.\n\n**Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Scores:**\n- malware: 0 (correct)\n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Purpose:** Module version and import.\n\n**Analysis & Findings:**\n- Same pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- Use of relative import is typical in modules.\n\n**Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Scores:**\n- malware: 0 (correct)\n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Purpose:** Version and import.\n\n**Analysis & Findings:**\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Import from local module is standard.\n\n**Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Scores:**\n- malware: 0 (correct)\n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are straightforward code, so 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated in report 2 due to wildcard import, but still low.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- The only point of concern is the wildcard import. While common in some codebases, it can be risky if `_low_index` is malicious or contains malicious code. However, given the context and the benign nature of the rest of the code, the current risk score of 0.2 in report 2 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\nConsidering all reports and the code, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal risk due to wildcard import, but not necessarily malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, benign version reporting module that imports from a local module. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk are present. The scores in the reports are reasonable, with minor caveats regarding import style.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Keep risk score low (~0.1–0.2), acknowledging the wildcard import as a potential concern but not evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**End of analysis.**",
