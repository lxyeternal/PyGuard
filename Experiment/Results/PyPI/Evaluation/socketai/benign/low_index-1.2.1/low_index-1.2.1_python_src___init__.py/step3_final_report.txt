  "purpose": "Provides version information and imports functions from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._low_index, reading the version string __version__.",
  "sinks": "The version() function returns the version string; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Import from ._low_index (source) to the module's namespace, then version() returns __version__ (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' from a local module; no dynamic code execution or network activity; straightforward version string.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import from a local module, defines a version string, and provides a function to return it. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is evident. The wildcard import could conceal malicious code if the imported module is compromised, but there is no evidence here. The version string and function are benign. The overall structure is standard and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the wildcard import, which warrants caution if the imported module is untrusted, but in this context, it appears safe.",
