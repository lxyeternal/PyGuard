  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code snippet and applying a critical security perspective.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom ._low_index import *\n\n# Version 1.1 was used for the cython implemention\n# Version 1.2 (and later) is used for the C++/pybind11 implementation\n__version__ = '1.2.1'\n\ndef version():\n    return __version__\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code performs a standard import from a local module (`_low_index`) using a wildcard.\n- It defines a version string and a function to return it.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data.\n- The import source is local, which reduces external attack surface.\n- Use of `import *` can obscure what is imported but is not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Benign, straightforward version reporting and import.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Comments:** Correct. No malicious behavior detected. The import is from a local module, and the version function is simple.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, notes potential concern with `import *`.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (due to wildcard import concern)\n- **Comments:** The wildcard import could hide malicious code if present in `_low_index`, but from this snippet alone, no malicious activity is evident. The report appropriately notes the potential risk but finds no evidence.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Benign, standard version management.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Comments:** Correct. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, benign, standard pattern.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Comments:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Benign, straightforward version and import.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Comments:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign.\n- The only concern is the use of `from ._low_index import *`, which could potentially import malicious code if `_low_index` is compromised, but there's no evidence here.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be very low, around 0, given the benign nature.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The wildcard import warrants caution in real-world scenarios, especially if `_low_index` is from an untrusted source or has been compromised. However, based solely on this code snippet, no malicious activity is detected.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious data handling.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.                     |\n| Security Risk    | 0                 | No security vulnerabilities identified in this snippet.    |\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe and benign.**",
