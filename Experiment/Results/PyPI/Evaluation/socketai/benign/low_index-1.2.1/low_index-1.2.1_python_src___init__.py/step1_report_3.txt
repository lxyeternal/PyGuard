  "purpose": "Define version information and import internal modules for a package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (_low_index), and string assignment for __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leaks or insecure data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; version() function simply returns a static string.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module, defines a version string, and provides a function to return that version. All operations are standard, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior observed. The import is from a local module, not external sources, and there are no indications of data exfiltration or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple, benign version management snippet with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
