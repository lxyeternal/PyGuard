{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to define a module version and import functionality from a local submodule.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own version string and imports from a local module '_low_index'.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks for untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "The only flow is importing all symbols from '_low_index' and returning the version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The import is from a local module, which is common.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from a local module '_low_index' and defines a version string indicating implementation details. The 'version()' function simply returns this version. There are no inputs, no network operations, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive actions. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages version info and imports a local module. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
