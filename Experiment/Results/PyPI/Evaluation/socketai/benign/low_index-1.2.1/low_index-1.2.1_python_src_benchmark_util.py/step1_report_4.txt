  "purpose": "Retrieve CPU information based on the operating system and transform words by expanding uppercase letters into a specific format.",
  "sources": "platform.system(), os.popen(), open('/proc/cpuinfo')",
  "sinks": "os.popen().read(), open().read(), return values",
  "flows": "platform.system() -> platform.processor()/sysctl command/read /proc/cpuinfo -> return output; expand_relator -> build transformed string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual dynamic code execution; no suspicious data flows or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the OS platform and retrieves CPU info accordingly, using standard system commands and file reading methods. The expand_relator function processes input words, transforming uppercase letters into a specific string pattern. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data being sent over networks, nor any code that could be malicious or maliciously obfuscated. The code performs benign system information retrieval and a simple string transformation without side effects or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, performing standard system information retrieval and string manipulation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
