  "purpose": "Retrieve CPU information based on the operating system and transform input words into a specific syllable-like format.",
  "sources": "Reads system information (platform.system(), os.popen(), and open('/proc/cpuinfo')) and input parameter in expand_relator.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data is sent over the network, written to files, or executed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system calls and file reads to return statements and string processing in expand_relator.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The expand_relator function transforms input data but does not process untrusted external data.",
  "analysis": "The cpu_info() function detects the OS and retrieves CPU details using platform-specific commands or file reads. These are standard system calls. The expand_relator() function converts each uppercase letter into a specific string pattern, which appears to be a string transformation rather than malicious behavior. No external network activity, credential handling, or system modifications are present. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate system information retrieval and string transformation tasks without any malicious intent or security risks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks.",
