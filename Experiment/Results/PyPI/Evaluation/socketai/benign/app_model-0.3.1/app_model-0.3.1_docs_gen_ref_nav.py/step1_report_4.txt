{
  "purpose": "The script generates documentation reference pages and navigation for Python modules within a specified source directory.",
  "sources": "Reads Python files (*.py) from the 'src' directory and its subdirectories.",
  "sinks": "Writes Markdown files for documentation in the 'reference' directory, and writes a SUMMARY.txt file with the navigation structure.",
  "flows": "Reads source code files from 'src', processes filenames and directory structure, then writes corresponding Markdown files and a navigation summary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code performs straightforward file processing and documentation generation.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically scans the 'src' directory for Python modules, filters out special files like '__init__.py' and modules starting with '_', then creates documentation stubs for each module. It builds a navigation structure for documentation purposes. No external network calls, data leaks, or code injections are present. The code uses standard library functions and a known documentation generation library. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign script for documentation generation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
