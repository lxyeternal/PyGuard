  "purpose": "Commented placeholder for adapter implementation to switch backends in an application model.",
  "sources": "No active data input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs, no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow, no source-to-sink paths, as the code contains only a comment and a TODO note.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code content; only a comment and a TODO note, no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a descriptive comment indicating the purpose of adapter functions for backend switching and a TODO note for future implementation. No actual executable code, data handling, or logic is present. No potential security risks, malware, or obfuscation are detectable within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple comment and a placeholder note with no executable logic or data handling. It poses no security risks, malware, or malicious intent. The code appears benign and standard for an initial development stage.",
