  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the provided code contains only comments and a TODO placeholder, with no executable logic, data handling, or security-sensitive operations.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities in the snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the lack of functional code, data flow, or security concerns.\n   - No logical errors or misjudgments are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is reasonable given the clear absence of any risky content.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a comment with a placeholder, there's no basis for assigning a high security risk or malware score.\n   - The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or detectable.\n   - The malware score of 0 across reports is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid speculative claims; they correctly interpret the code as a placeholder.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final System Evaluation:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple comment and a TODO placeholder with no executable or sensitive logic. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high confidence in the benign nature of this snippet supports these scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary. The code fragment is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
