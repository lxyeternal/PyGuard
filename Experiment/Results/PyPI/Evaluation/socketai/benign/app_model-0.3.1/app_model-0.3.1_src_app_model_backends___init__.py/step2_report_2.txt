  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as consisting solely of comments and TODO placeholders.\n- No actual executable code, data input/output, or logic is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as incomplete, benign, and non-risky.\n\n**Specific analysis:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - Confirmed: The code contains only comments and a TODO note. No functional or risky code exists.\n   - No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the lack of executable code, data flow, or suspicious activity.\n   - No logical flaws or errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which are appropriate given the content.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are at 0.\n   - This is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code contains no malicious code or behavior.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately interpret the code as placeholder comments.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis and the code's content.\n\n**Summary and personal assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n- The code is a non-functional placeholder, typical in early development stages.\n- No security concerns or malicious activity are present.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are correct in their assessments. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign, placeholder nature. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0",
