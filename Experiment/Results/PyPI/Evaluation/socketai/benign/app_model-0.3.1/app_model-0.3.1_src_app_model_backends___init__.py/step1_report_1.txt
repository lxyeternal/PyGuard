  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment describing the purpose of the file and a TODO note. There are no functional code, data handling, or potentially risky constructs present. The comment indicates plans to implement a 'use_app()' adapter for switching backends, but this is not yet implemented. No code injection, malicious logic, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is an incomplete code fragment containing only comments with no executable or risky code. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security threats in the provided snippet.",
