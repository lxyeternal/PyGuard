  "flows": "None, no data or control flow present",
  "anomalies": "None; code consists solely of comments and a placeholder",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a comment and a TODO placeholder, with no executable logic, data input/output, or security-sensitive operations. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code is benign and typical of an initial development stub. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, with confidence: 1, are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder with no security concerns or malicious intent. The current scores accurately reflect its harmless nature, and no revisions are necessary.",
