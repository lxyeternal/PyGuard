  "purpose": "The code appears to provide adapters for integrating an 'app_model' with different backend systems, possibly to allow flexible backend switching.",
  "sources": "The comment suggests that the code may read configuration or import statements related to backend adapters, but no actual data input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no executable flows or data transfers within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only comments and a TODO placeholder without any executable or sensitive logic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are visible.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a minimal comment block indicating planned functionality for adapter switching and a placeholder for future implementation. It does not include any executable code, input handling, or data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign comment and a placeholder for future development. There are no security concerns, malicious intent, or anomalies detected.",
