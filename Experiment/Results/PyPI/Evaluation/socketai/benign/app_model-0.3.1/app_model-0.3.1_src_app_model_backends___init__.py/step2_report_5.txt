  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The provided code consists solely of comments and a TODO placeholder.\n   - There is no executable code, data input/output, or logic.\n   - The comments indicate an intention to implement adapter functions for switching backends, but this is not yet realized.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The TODO comment suggests incomplete development, not malicious intent.\n\n3. **Assessment of Risks:**\n   - Since there's no actual code, data flow, or logic, the security risk is effectively zero.\n   - The absence of executable code means no attack vectors are present.\n   - The code is benign and typical for an initial development stub.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is plain comments, no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk detected.\n\n5. **Potential Issues in the Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is only comments with a TODO placeholder.\n   - They consistently assign maximum confidence (1) that there are no issues.\n   - No report claims or implies any malicious or obfuscated code, which is accurate.\n\n6. **Any Discrepancies or Changes Needed?**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate given the code snippet.\n   - No adjustments needed in the scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — clear, unobfuscated comments only.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risk present.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign placeholder with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and do not require revision.",
