  "purpose": "To perform a string replacement in markdown content, replacing a specific placeholder with an extended version including options for documentation styling.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'md' which contains markdown text.",
  "sinks": "The 'md.replace' function modifies the markdown string in place; no external data or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "flows": "Input markdown string -> string replacement operation -> output markdown string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is static, straightforward, and performs a simple string substitution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that replaces all instances of '::: app_model.types' with an extended version that adds options for documentation styling. It involves no external data access, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation. The logic is simple and static, serving formatting purposes. The code does not contain any malicious patterns, credentials, or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The function's purpose is purely for documentation formatting, with no security concerns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static string replacement utility intended for documentation formatting. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary.",
