{
  "purpose": "The function modifies markdown text by replacing a specific placeholder string with an extended version that includes additional options.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'md' which contains the markdown string to be transformed.",
  "sinks": "The return value which outputs the modified markdown string, potentially used elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The code takes 'md' as input, performs a string replacement, and outputs the modified string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code performs a simple string replacement without any external data access or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The function defines two strings, T and T2, where T is a placeholder string and T2 is T with additional options appended. It then replaces occurrences of T in the input markdown with T2. The logic appears straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, external calls, or sensitive data handling. No obfuscated code or malicious activity is present. The code seems intended for formatting or configuration purposes, likely within a documentation or plugin context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple string substitution to modify markdown content. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
