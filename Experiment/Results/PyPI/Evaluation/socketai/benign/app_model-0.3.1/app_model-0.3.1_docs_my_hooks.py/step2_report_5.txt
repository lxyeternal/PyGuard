  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The function `on_page_markdown` performs a simple string replacement: it replaces occurrences of `\"::: app_model.types\"` with a longer string that adds options for documentation styling.\n- There are no external data accesses, no code execution, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns.\n- The purpose appears to be purely for formatting or documentation enhancement.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and serves a formatting purpose.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or security risks are detected.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, which is consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. The malware score of 0 is justified; there's no malicious activity.  \n  The obfuscated score is 0; the code is clear and straightforward.  \n  The security risk score of 0 is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n- **Any issues with the reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the code as a benign string replacement utility with no security concerns.\n\n- **Any discrepancies?**  \n  No. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The code is static, with no dynamic or external components, so the risk and malware scores should remain at 0.\n- The only potential concern could be if this code were part of a larger, malicious pipeline, but based solely on this snippet, there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the reports and code:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports.** The code is benign, straightforward, and serves a documentation formatting purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided reports are accurate and reasonable. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
