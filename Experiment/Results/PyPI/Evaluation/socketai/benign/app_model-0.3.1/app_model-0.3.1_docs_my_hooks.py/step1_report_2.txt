  "purpose": "The function modifies markdown content by replacing a specific string with an extended version, likely for formatting or documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'md' (a string), which is the markdown content passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs the modified markdown string; no untrusted data is directly sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The function reads 'md' as input, performs a string replacement operation, and returns the modified string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs a simple string substitution without executing or evaluating external data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that takes markdown content and replaces a specific placeholder string with an extended version that includes additional formatting options. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The string manipulation appears to serve a documentation or formatting purpose. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs a benign string replacement operation for markdown formatting purposes.",
