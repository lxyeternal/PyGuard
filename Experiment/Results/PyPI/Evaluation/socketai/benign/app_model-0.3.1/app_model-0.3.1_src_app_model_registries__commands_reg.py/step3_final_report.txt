  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency, focusing on malicious behavior, sabotage, and security risks within the code.",
  "sources": "Dynamic import via import_python_name in resolved_callback, dependency injection points, callback registration and execution pathways.",
  "sinks": "Execution of callbacks, dynamic module import, potential injection points if callback strings are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Source: callback string or module name -> import_python_name resolving to module -> callback invocation -> potential malicious code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import with untrusted input, reliance on dependency injection without validation, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a command registry with dynamic import capabilities for callbacks, which introduces a security concern if callback identifiers are untrusted. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary risk stems from the potential for arbitrary code execution via unvalidated callback strings. The dynamic import mechanism is a common attack vector in plugin architectures. The code's structure and clarity indicate no obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the identified risks, with malware scores at 0 and moderate security risk scores (~0.4-0.45). To mitigate risks, validation of callback identifiers before import is recommended.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is a standard command registry with dynamic import features, which pose a moderate security risk if callback strings are untrusted. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is found. Proper validation and sandboxing of callback modules are advised to reduce potential exploitation.",
