{
  "purpose": "Manage application state, registries, context, and lifecycle within a framework, including action registration and disposal.",
  "sources": "Parameters during instantiation, environment variables (`sys.platform`, `os.name`), method arguments, class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Context updates, signal emissions, registry modifications; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data from inputs and environment info into internal context and registries; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard application framework component managing singleton instances, context, registries, and lifecycle. It reads environment info for configuration but does not perform any network, file, or malicious system operations. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The use of signals and registry management is typical. The code is well-structured, readable, and aligns with common design patterns for application management classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1–0.2), justified by environment detection practices that are standard and non-malicious.",
