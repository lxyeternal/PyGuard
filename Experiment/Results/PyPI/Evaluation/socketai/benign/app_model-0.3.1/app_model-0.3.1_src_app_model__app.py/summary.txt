  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1–0.2), justified by environment detection practices that are standard and non-malicious."
