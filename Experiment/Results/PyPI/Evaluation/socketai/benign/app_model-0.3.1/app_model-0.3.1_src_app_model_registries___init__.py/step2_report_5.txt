  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module that imports internal classes/functions and re-exports them via `__all__`.\n- No report mentions any suspicious behavior, dynamic code execution, external data handling, or obfuscated code.\n- The code is standard for Python package organization, with no signs of malware, hardcoded secrets, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which seems consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any user input, network calls, or dynamic execution.\n- The imported modules are internal (`._commands_reg`, `._keybindings_reg`, etc.), which are typical for internal package structure.\n- No anomalies, such as obfuscation or suspicious patterns, are observed.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware score: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- Obfuscated score: All assign 0, which is correct.\n- Security risk: All assign 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1, reflecting high certainty based on the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n- The code appears safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a simple, well-structured module for exporting internal registry classes and functions, with no security concerns.",
