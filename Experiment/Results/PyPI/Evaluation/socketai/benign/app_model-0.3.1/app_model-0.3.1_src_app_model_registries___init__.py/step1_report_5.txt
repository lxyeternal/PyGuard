  "purpose": "This module appears to serve as an aggregator or interface for registering commands, keybindings, and menus, likely in an application that supports customizable user interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._commands_reg, ._keybindings_reg, ._menus_reg, and ._register",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or security effects; no network, file, or system command execution observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to critical sinks; the code only imports and defines __all__ for exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs observed; code structure is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from internal modules and exports them via __all__, facilitating module API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no dynamic code execution, nor external data handling. It functions as a simple interface layer, with no evident security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard module aggregator with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be safe and straightforward.",
