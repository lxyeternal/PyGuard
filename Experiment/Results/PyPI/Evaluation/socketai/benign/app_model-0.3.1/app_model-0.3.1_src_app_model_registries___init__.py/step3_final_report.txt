  "purpose": "Organize and expose internal registry classes and functions related to commands, keybindings, menus, and registration within a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules (_commands_reg, _keybindings_reg, _menus_reg, _register). No user input, network, or dynamic data handling.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Import of internal classes/functions → inclusion in __all__ for export; no data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific classes and functions from internal modules and re-exports them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, organizational module with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's clarity and static structure support a high confidence in its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe organizational module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and should remain as-is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
