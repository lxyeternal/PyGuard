{
  "purpose": "The code provides a schema for a Python application, importing modules, setting version info, and defining exports.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version function, the 'app-model' package, and internal module imports",
  "sinks": "None of the code appears to process untrusted data or perform external communications directly",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks identified",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.metadata to dynamically retrieve package version is standard; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to dynamically determine its version using importlib.metadata, falling back to 'uninstalled' if the package is not found. It imports internal modules and defines exports. No untrusted input processing or external communications are present. The code structure is typical for Python packages and does not contain obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard package initialization code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs safe imports and exports without any suspicious patterns.",
