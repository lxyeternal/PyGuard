{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and configures the application by importing necessary modules, setting version information, and defining exports.",
  "sources": "Reading package version using importlib.metadata.version and importing internal modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; version retrieval is safe, and module imports are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed. The version fallback is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles module imports, retrieves package version information, and sets up exports. The version retrieval is a standard, safe operation. Importing internal modules does not pose security risks. No evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The code structure is straightforward and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module initialization script without malicious intent or security risks.",
