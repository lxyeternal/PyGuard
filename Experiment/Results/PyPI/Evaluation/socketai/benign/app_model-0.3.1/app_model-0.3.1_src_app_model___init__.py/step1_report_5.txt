{
  "purpose": "Defines and exports application metadata and core components for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version via importlib.metadata and imports local modules.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are observed.",
  "flows": "The version retrieval flow: reads package version, assigns default if not found. Imports from local modules do not involve untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. The use of importlib.metadata version is standard for package versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to retrieve the package version dynamically, handling the case where the package is not installed. It then imports local modules and defines exports. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. No external data is processed or transmitted. The code is typical for package setup or initialization scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as an initialization script for a Python package with standard practices. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
