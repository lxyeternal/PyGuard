  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward package initialization script:\n  - Retrieves package version via `importlib.metadata.version`.\n  - Handles `PackageNotFoundError` gracefully.\n  - Imports internal modules and exposes core components via `__all__`.\n- No untrusted data handling, external network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscation.\n- All reports conclude the code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is consistent across all reports; no issues are present in the code itself.\n- The scores assigned for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are all zero, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are identified.\n- The reasoning in all reports is sound; they correctly interpret the code as standard package setup.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These are appropriate given the code.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- Since all evidence points to benign code, there is no justification for increasing the scores.\n- The `confidence` scores are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable.\n\n### Malware assessment:\n- No malicious activity is suggested or detectable.\n- The malware score remains at 0.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- All claims are based on static code analysis without external inputs or suspicious patterns.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are necessary or supported.\n\n### Consistency:\n- Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The reports correctly interpret the code as safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the code and reports:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0** |\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a standard initialization script with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- No external or untrusted data flows.\n- All evidence supports a safe, conventional implementation.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
