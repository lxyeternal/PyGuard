  "purpose": "Standard package initialization script for retrieving version info and importing core modules.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version call, local module imports",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs",
  "flows": "Version retrieval from importlib.metadata to __version__, imports to __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard code with no obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup: it attempts to get the package version via importlib.metadata, defaults if not found, and imports local modules. No external network calls, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted data. The code is clear, readable, and follows best practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence, and assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe package initialization script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
