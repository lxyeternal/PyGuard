{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and exposes components of a Python package, including version information and imports core classes and functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata using importlib.metadata.version and potentially imports internal modules and functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external output occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "The package version is retrieved and stored; internal modules and classes are imported and exposed via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. Usage of importlib.metadata is standard for package versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to determine its package version using importlib.metadata. If the package is not installed, it sets a default version string. It then imports internal modules and defines __all__ for exports. There are no external inputs, unsafe code execution, or malicious patterns. The code appears straightforward, with no anomalies or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization script with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply manages version info and exports core components.",
