  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n\nThe code is a typical Python package initialization script:\n- It attempts to retrieve the package version via `importlib.metadata.version(\"app-model\")`.\n- If the package isn't installed, it defaults to `\"uninstalled\"`.\n- It imports core classes and functions from local modules.\n- It defines `__all__` for exports.\n\n**Security Analysis:**\n\n- No untrusted data is processed.\n- No external network calls or dynamic code execution.\n- The use of `importlib.metadata` is standard for version retrieval.\n- The fallback to `\"uninstalled\"` is a common pattern.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscation.\n- All imports are from local or standard libraries.\n\n**Review of Reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1, one at 0.9), indicating certainty that the code is benign.\n- Malware scores are zero across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- Security risk scores are zero, as expected.\n\n**Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n\n- No issues are identified in the code.\n- The reasoning in the reports is sound; they correctly interpret the code as safe.\n- The scores assigned seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0, given the evidence.\n- The reports are accurate and do not require adjustments.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The reports correctly reflect this assessment.",
