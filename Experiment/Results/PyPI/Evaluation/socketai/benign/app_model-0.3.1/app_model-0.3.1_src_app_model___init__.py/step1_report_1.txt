{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package, retrieves its version, and imports core components for use in the application.",
  "sources": "Reading package version via importlib.metadata.version; importing modules and classes from local package files.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from source to sink; the version retrieval and module imports are standard initialization steps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments. The version fallback is standard; no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package initialization by retrieving its version and importing essential modules and components. It handles a common exception when the package is not installed. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or data leaks. All imports are from local or standard libraries. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or other suspicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
