  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-driven implementation of a gRPC server-side OpenTracing interceptor. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minor concern regarding payload logging is a configurable privacy consideration, not a security threat. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect the benign nature of the code."
