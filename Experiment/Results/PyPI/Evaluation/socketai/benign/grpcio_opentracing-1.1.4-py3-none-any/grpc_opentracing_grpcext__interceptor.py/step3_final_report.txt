  "purpose": "Implementation of gRPC Python interceptors for client and server sides, enabling middleware functionalities such as logging, tracing, or request modification.",
  "sources": "Method parameters and request/response handlers within interceptor classes, including request data and call metadata.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of base callables with request data and metadata, potential data flow paths from sources to sinks.",
  "flows": "Requests passing through interceptor wrappers, invoking base callables, and returning responses; source-to-sink paths are standard for middleware.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected. The code follows standard gRPC interceptor patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, modular implementation of gRPC interceptors for both client and server, utilizing standard Python collections and gRPC interfaces. It wraps callables and handlers to insert interception logic without altering core functionality. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The data flow is typical for middleware, with no suspicious data exfiltration or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified based on the code's structure and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of gRPC interceptors with no malicious intent or security flaws. All assessments are consistent and accurate. The malware score remains 0, obfuscation score 0, and low risk scores are appropriate. The code can be considered safe for use in production environments.",
