  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious activity, with a malware score of 0.\n- **Score justification:** Given the code is a standard gRPC interceptor implementation, with no suspicious patterns, external network activity, or obfuscation, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** The low risk score (0.1) seems reasonable, as the code could be misused if misconfigured, but no direct vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the analysis indicates a legitimate, standard implementation with no malicious intent.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0 aligns with the code's content.\n- **Security risk:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code appears to be a straightforward implementation of gRPC interceptors, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0 matches the code's nature.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher (0.2) but still low; acceptable given the context.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; the code is standard, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0 fits.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 is reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Well justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** The analysis indicates standard middleware implementation, with no malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 is acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, with scores of 0.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) is reasonable considering the potential for misuse, but no actual vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, based on potential misuse, but no actual risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and well-justified. The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of gRPC interceptors with no malicious intent or security flaws detected.",
