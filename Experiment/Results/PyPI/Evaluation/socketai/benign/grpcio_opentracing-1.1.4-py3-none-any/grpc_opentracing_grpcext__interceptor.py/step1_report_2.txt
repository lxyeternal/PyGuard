  "purpose": "Implementation of gRPC Python interceptors for both client and server sides, allowing for request/response modification and inspection.",
  "sources": "Imports from grpc, grpc_opentracing, and collections; usage of interceptor classes and methods; access to request, response, and metadata within interceptors.",
  "sinks": "Calls to base_callable methods, property accesses for request/response serializers, and interceptor methods; potential data flow from untrusted sources to these points.",
  "flows": "Input requests and metadata flow into interceptor wrappers, which then invoke the base callables; interceptors may modify or inspect data at these points; responses flow back through the interceptors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code appears to be a standard, modular implementation of gRPC interceptors without obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple interceptor classes for both client and server gRPC calls, wrapping existing callables and handlers to allow interception of requests and responses. It uses well-structured patterns with properties and nested functions to adapt callables for interception purposes. The imports are standard, and there are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The use of grpc and grpc_opentracing aligns with common monitoring/tracing implementations. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code injection, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code's purpose is to augment gRPC communication with interceptors, which is a legitimate use case.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of gRPC interceptors with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It facilitates request/response interception for both client and server, with no indication of data leakage, sabotage, or malicious intent.",
