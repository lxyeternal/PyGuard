{
  "purpose": "Implement gRPC Python interceptors for client and server-side request handling and middleware functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'grpc', 'collections', and 'grpc_opentracing'; usage of method arguments and attributes related to gRPC channels, calls, and interceptors.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of base callables for gRPC methods, handling of request and response serializers/deserializers, and potential network communication through interceptors.",
  "flows": "Interceptor classes wrap around gRPC calls, passing requests through custom invoker functions; channel and server wrappers pass requests to underlying gRPC components; interceptors modify or extend behavior based on request context.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code structure is complex but standard for gRPC middleware implementation. No obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns, no data leakage, or privacy violations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive implementation of gRPC interceptors for both client and server sides. It includes wrappers around gRPC callables and server handlers to insert custom logic. The use of named tuples and clear property methods indicates well-structured middleware design. There are no signs of malicious activities such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection. It operates within the expected scope of gRPC request interception and forwarding. No security vulnerabilities like hardcoded secrets or insecure practices are evident. Overall, the code appears legitimate and standard for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard gRPC interceptor middleware with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe, well-structured, and consistent with legitimate use cases in gRPC systems.",
