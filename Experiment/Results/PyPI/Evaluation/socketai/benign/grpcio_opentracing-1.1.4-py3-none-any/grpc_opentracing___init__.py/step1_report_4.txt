{
  "purpose": "This code provides a framework for integrating OpenTracing with gRPC, enabling distributed tracing in client and server applications.",
  "sources": "import statements, function parameters, external module imports",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct data processing or untrusted data handling evident",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from source to sink involving untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code appears standard and well-structured",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract classes for active span sourcing and RPC info, and functions to create gRPC interceptors for OpenTracing. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no external data handling that could be malicious. The import of 'grpc' and 'six' modules are standard dependencies, and the functions merely return interceptor objects from external modules. The code does not contain suspicious patterns or malicious payloads. The only external interaction is importing from 'grpc_opentracing', which is expected for this context. No indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for integrating OpenTracing with gRPC. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, nor does it show signs of obfuscation or malware. It appears safe and intended for tracing instrumentation.",
