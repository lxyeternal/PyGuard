  "purpose": "Define interfaces and helper functions for integrating OpenTracing with gRPC in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, class definitions, and function parameters, especially 'tracer', 'active_span_source', 'span_decorator', and external '_client' and '_server' modules.",
  "sinks": "Calls to external modules '_client.OpenTracingClientInterceptor' and '_server.OpenTracingServerInterceptor', which could execute code from external modules.",
  "flows": "Initialization functions pass parameters to external interceptor constructors; data flows from user-supplied 'tracer' and optional 'span_decorator' into external modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. Use of 'import six' suggests compatibility across Python versions, not malicious. External module imports are standard, but the actual source code of '_client' and '_server' is not included, which could hide malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract base classes for tracing spans and RPC info, and provides factory functions to create gRPC interceptors for OpenTracing. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior evident. The use of external modules '_client' and '_server' is common for extending functionality but could be malicious if those modules are compromised; however, the code itself does not contain malicious behavior. The functions are straightforward and do not perform dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard interface and factory setup for integrating OpenTracing with gRPC, with no direct signs of malicious behavior. The potential risk depends on the external '_client' and '_server' modules, which are not included here. Overall, the code itself is benign and functional.",
