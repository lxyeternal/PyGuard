  "purpose": "Provides interfaces and factory functions for integrating OpenTracing with gRPC in Python, enabling tracing of RPC calls.",
  "sources": "Imports standard modules (`abc`, `enum`, `six`, `grpc`) and dynamically imports internal modules (`grpc_opentracing._client`, `_server`) within functions.",
  "sinks": "Calls to external interceptor classes (`_client.OpenTracingClientInterceptor`, `_server.OpenTracingServerInterceptor`) which may execute code from external modules.",
  "flows": "External modules are invoked during interceptor creation; no data flows from untrusted sources within this code itself.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports within functions is typical for plugin architectures but could be exploited if external modules are malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract classes for span sources, RPC info, and span decorators, and provides factory functions to create gRPC interceptors for tracing. The imports are standard, and the dynamic import pattern is common for optional plugin loading. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present. External modules (`grpc_opentracing._client`, `_server`) are external dependencies whose trustworthiness depends on their source, but the code itself is benign. The overall structure and logic are straightforward and align with standard tracing setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for integrating OpenTracing with gRPC in Python. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behavior is evident. The low security risk score is justified, primarily due to reliance on external modules which should be verified separately. The malware score remains zero, indicating no malicious intent detected.",
