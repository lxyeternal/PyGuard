The low security risk score is justified, primarily due to reliance on external modules which should be verified separately. The malware score remains zero, indicating no malicious intent detected."

It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minor concern regarding payload logging is a configurable privacy consideration, not a security threat. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect the benign nature of the code."

The malware score remains 0, obfuscation score 0, and low risk scores are appropriate. The code can be considered safe for use in production environments."
