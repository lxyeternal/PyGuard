{
  "purpose": "The code defines abstract classes and functions related to gRPC interceptors for client and server sides, allowing customization of RPC handling and interception.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, method signatures, import statements, and comments. It also imports external modules (`six`, `abc`, and `_interceptor`).",
  "sinks": "The code invokes external functions (`_interceptor.intercept_channel` and `_interceptor.intercept_server`) which may perform operations on network channels or servers, but without their implementation, the data flow is unclear.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves calling functions (`intercept_channel`, `intercept_server`) that delegate to external intercepted functions; class methods may be implemented elsewhere, but here, only interfaces are defined.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, suspicious function implementations, or unusual code patterns are present. The code mostly contains abstract class definitions and straightforward delegation to external interceptors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of abstract base classes for gRPC interceptors on client and server sides, with methods for intercepting unary and stream RPCs. It includes functions to create intercepted channels and servers by delegating to external modules (`_interceptor`). No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. External dependencies are used in a standard manner, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected. The purpose appears to be providing a framework for interceptors, not executing any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of interceptor interfaces for gRPC with delegation to external modules for actual interception logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. Overall security risk is minimal, with no malicious intent detected.",
