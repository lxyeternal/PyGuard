{
  "purpose": "The code defines abstract classes and functions for gRPC interceptors and information objects used in RPC communication, facilitating the creation and handling of interceptors for client and server-side RPCs.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (abc, six), and internal modules (_interceptor from grpc_opentracing.grpcext). No external data input or external source reads are present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive actions like network transmission, database access, or file operations.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves defining abstract classes and utility functions for interceptors; data flows from the function parameters to the methods that would invoke interceptors or handlers, but no untrusted data is processed or transmitted within this module.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code strictly defines interfaces and utility functions for gRPC interceptors, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The module contains class definitions for client and server interceptors, info objects, and utility functions for creating intercepted channels and servers. It relies on an external '_interceptor' module for core interception logic. The structure is typical for gRPC interceptor implementations. There are no code injections, data leaks, or malicious operations; the code only sets up infrastructure for interceptors. No input/output operations, network transmissions, or data handling are performed directly.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard infrastructure setup for gRPC interceptors with no malicious behavior detected. It is designed for extensibility and integration with other modules. There are no signs of sabotage, malware, or security risks within this code segment.",
