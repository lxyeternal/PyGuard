{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract classes and utility functions for gRPC interceptors on client and server sides, delegating core logic to external modules.",
  "sources": "Standard libraries (abc, six) and external module 'grpc_opentracing.grpcext._interceptor'. No untrusted data handling within this code.",
  "sinks": "Delegates to external '_interceptor' functions, which could perform interception or modification, but no malicious activity is evident here.",
  "flows": "Delegation pattern to external modules; no internal data flow or processing of untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; standard pattern for interceptor setup.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up abstract classes and functions for gRPC interceptors, relying on external modules for actual interception logic. No data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. External dependencies are the only potential attack vector, but within this code, no malicious intent is observable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign infrastructure for gRPC interceptors with no signs of malicious activity. The external '_interceptor' module's trustworthiness is the only external concern, but the code itself is safe.",
