{
  "purpose": "The code defines abstract classes and functions for intercepting and managing gRPC client and server calls, including channel and server interception mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'abc', 'six', and 'grpc_opentracing.grpcext'; class attribute definitions; function parameters; imported modules used within functions.",
  "sinks": "Calls to external modules '_interceptor.intercept_channel' and '_interceptor.intercept_server', which could potentially perform network operations or malicious actions if tampered with.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining abstract interceptors, to functions that invoke external interception methods, which could potentially manipulate or monitor RPC traffic if malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external module 'grpc_opentracing.grpcext' without context; no direct data handling or suspicious variable usage; no hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns. Code structure is typical for interceptors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up abstract classes and wrapper functions for intercepting gRPC calls, relying on external modules for actual interception logic. No input data, nor sensitive data handling is present. The external module calls could be malicious if compromised, but there is no evidence within this snippet. No obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns, and no hardcoded credentials are observed. The code appears standard for interceptors with reliance on external interception mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard implementation of gRPC interceptors with external hook points. No malicious or sabotage behavior is evident within this code fragment. Its primary purpose is to facilitate interception, with external modules handling core logic. The security risk is low, assuming external modules are trustworthy.",
