  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'patsy' Python library, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; executing 'patsy/version.py' to define __version__.",
  "sinks": "None present. No data is sent over network, written to files, or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Reading files (README.md and version.py) to assign variables, no external data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to run 'patsy/version.py' which could be risky if the file content is malicious, but typical for version assignment; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup: reading README.md for long description, executing version.py to set __version__, and calling setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No suspicious code, no untrusted data handling, no network activity, and no malicious logic detected. The use of 'exec' for versioning is common practice, though it carries a slight risk if the version.py file is compromised. Overall, the code appears straightforward and typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security issues. The only minor concern is the use of 'exec' for version assignment, which is common but could be replaced with safer alternatives. No signs of malware or malicious activity.",
