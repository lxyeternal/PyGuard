  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'patsy' Python library, describing its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description, executes version.py to define __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no external data output or user input handling.",
  "flows": "Reads from files to set package metadata; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to execute code from 'patsy/version.py', which could be malicious if the file is tampered with. However, this is a common pattern for setting version variables.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python package using setuptools. The only potentially risky operation is executing 'version.py' via 'exec', which could be exploited if the file is maliciously altered. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code does not handle untrusted input, nor does it perform network operations or system modifications. All dependencies are standard and well-known. Overall, the code appears safe, with a minor concern around executing external files.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup.py for a Python package with a minor risk associated with executing external version code. No malicious behavior or malware is evident. The overall security risk is very low.",
