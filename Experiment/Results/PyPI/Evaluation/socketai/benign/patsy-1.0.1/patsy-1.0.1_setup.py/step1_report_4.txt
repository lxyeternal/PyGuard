  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'patsy' Python package, configuring metadata, dependencies, and packaging information.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; executing the version.py file to define __version__.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output functions observed.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md to LONG_DESC, executing version.py to define __version__, then passing these to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute the contents of version.py, which could be risky if the file contains malicious code. The rest of the script is standard packaging setup.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up package metadata and dependencies, which is typical for Python packages. The use of exec() on version.py is a potential security concern because it executes arbitrary code in that file. However, if version.py is maintained as a simple file defining __version__, the risk is minimal but still worth noting. No other suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. There are no code injection, data leakage, or network activity involved.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script performs standard package configuration with a notable use of exec() on a local version file. No malicious behavior detected, but the exec() call could be replaced with a safer import or read method. Overall, low suspicion, primarily a standard setup script.",
