  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious activity. The only minor concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which is common but could be replaced with safer practices. Scores are appropriate: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1-0.2. Overall, the script poses very low security risk and is safe to use, assuming the version.py file is maintained securely."
