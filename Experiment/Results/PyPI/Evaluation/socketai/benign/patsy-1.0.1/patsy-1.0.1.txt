      "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious activity. The only minor concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which is common but could be replaced with safer practices. Scores are appropriate: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1-0.2. Overall, the script poses very low security risk and is safe to use, assuming the version.py file is maintained securely."

The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). The code relies on trusted libraries and performs mathematical operations consistent with its purpose."

The main consideration is ensuring that user input is trusted or sanitized before parsing, but the code's validation mitigates potential risks. Overall, the code is secure and appropriate for its purpose."
