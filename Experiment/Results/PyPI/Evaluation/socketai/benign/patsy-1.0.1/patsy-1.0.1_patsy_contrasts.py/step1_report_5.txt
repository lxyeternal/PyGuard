{
  "purpose": "This source code provides various statistical contrast coding schemes for categorical variables, including Treatment, Poly, Sum, Helmert, and Diff, used for designing matrices in statistical models.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from functions like code_with_intercept and code_without_intercept, primarily the 'levels' parameter passed to these functions. No external untrusted sources or user inputs are directly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the code; it does not write data to external systems, network, files, or execute external commands. It primarily constructs numpy arrays and data structures for internal use.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters such as 'levels' and 'scores' to the creation of numpy arrays within contrast matrix functions, without external output or data leakage points.",
  "anomalies": "The code is well-structured with standard statistical coding schemes. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscation or misleading variable usage is evident. No code executes external commands or network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes for contrast coding schemes, each creating contrast matrices based on input levels and optional parameters. Functions for creating these matrices are straightforward, using numpy operations, QR decompositions, and array manipulations. No data is handled insecurely; there are no external data reads or writes, nor any system calls, network operations, or cryptographic material. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code features are detected. The code is purely mathematical and statistical in nature, with standard implementations for contrast matrices.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a secure, standard implementation of various contrast coding schemes used in statistical modeling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs statistical matrix calculations without external dependencies or harmful actions.",
