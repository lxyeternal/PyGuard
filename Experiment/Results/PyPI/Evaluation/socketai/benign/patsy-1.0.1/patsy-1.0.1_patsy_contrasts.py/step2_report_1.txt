  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** The code defines classes/functions for contrast coding, with data flowing from input levels to contrast matrices. No external data or untrusted sources are involved.\n- **Malware & Security Risks:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues detected. The code performs standard matrix operations, with no suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores & Justification:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis. Risk score is low (0.1), reflecting minimal security concern.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate statistical utility with no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on contrast matrices for categorical variables, with no external or untrusted data sources.\n- **Malware & Security Risks:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or external communication.\n- **Scores & Justification:** Malware score is 0, consistent with the analysis. Security risk is low.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe implementation of statistical contrast coding.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Same as above, with emphasis on the statistical purpose.\n- **Malware & Security Risks:** No suspicious code, external calls, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores & Justification:** Malware score remains 0, matching the analysis. Security risk is negligible.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate statistical code, no malware.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Focused on contrast coding, with no external data or unsafe operations.\n- **Malware & Security Risks:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores & Justification:** Malware score is 0, consistent with the findings.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to others, purely mathematical contrast coding.\n- **Malware & Security Risks:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external system access.\n- **Scores & Justification:** Malware score is 0, aligning with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The code is purely statistical matrix manipulation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, as the code does not interact with external systems or handle sensitive data insecurely.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal security risk, mainly due to the nature of statistical code, not security flaws)\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning confirms that the code is a standard implementation of statistical contrast matrices, with no malicious or security-compromising features.**",
