{
  "purpose": "The code implements a parser for infix expressions using the shunting yard algorithm, intended for processing formulas and constraints with detailed error reporting.",
  "sources": "Reads tokens from the provided token list, including token type, origin, and extra data; uses token type to determine parsing flow.",
  "sinks": "Creates ParseNode objects with args; no explicit data sinks for untrusted data; no network or file I/O operations observed.",
  "flows": "Tokens are read sequentially; _read_noun_context and _read_op_context process tokens, pushing/popping from stacks; _run_op combines stack elements into ParseNodes; final parse returns a single root node.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; the origin object is used for error reporting but not malicious; no suspicious dynamic execution, network activity, or system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements a standard shunting yard parser, with careful handling of parentheses, unary/binary operators, and error conditions. No embedded or hidden malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The presence of origin objects and detailed error handling suggests attention to robust error reporting rather than malicious intent. No external communication, file I/O, or suspicious code constructs are present. The usage of no_pickling wrappers indicates security considerations for serialization, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured parser implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It performs expression parsing using common algorithms without any hidden or harmful activities. The overall security risk is low.",
