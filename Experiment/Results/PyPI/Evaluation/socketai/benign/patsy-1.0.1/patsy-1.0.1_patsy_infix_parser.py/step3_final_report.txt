{
  "purpose": "The code implements a shunting yard algorithm parser for infix expressions, used within Patsy for formula parsing, constructing parse trees from tokens with error reporting support.",
  "sources": "Reads tokens from the token stream, including token type, origin, and extra data; processes parentheses, operators, and atomic types.",
  "sinks": "Constructs ParseNode objects representing parts of the parse tree; no external data sinks or network communication.",
  "flows": "Token input flows into parsing functions, which push/pop operators and operands on stacks, ultimately producing a single parse tree node.",
  "anomalies": "Uses singleton objects for parentheses tokens, but these are benign and standard in such implementations; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a standard infix parser using the shunting yard algorithm. It handles tokens safely, constructs parse trees, and manages error reporting via origin attributes. No malicious code, external communication, or obfuscation is present. The token types and processing logic are typical for such parsers, and the use of custom singleton tokens for parentheses is benign. The code's structure and behavior align with safe, well-understood parsing components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard parser implementation with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal risk score reflects the safe nature of the code.",
