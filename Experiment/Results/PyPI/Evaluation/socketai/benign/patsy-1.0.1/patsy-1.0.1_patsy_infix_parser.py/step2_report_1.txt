  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is a standard infix parser using the shunting yard algorithm, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. It emphasizes that the code handles tokens, constructs parse trees, and uses origin info solely for error reporting.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; the code is a typical parser with no signs of malicious activity. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard parsing logic, safe handling of tokens, and no external communication or malicious patterns. Notes the custom token types for parentheses are benign.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Justification:** The assessment is consistent; no malicious intent detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Also confirms standard implementation, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. Mentions safe internal methods and no external communication.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (still very low)\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher but still negligible; the reasoning remains valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is a standard parser with proper handling, no malicious behavior, and no external data leaks or malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Justification:** Consistent with prior assessments.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: a well-structured, standard parser with no malicious or obfuscated code, no external communication, and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is thorough and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0. The code is a straightforward parser with no malicious patterns, no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** While most reports assign very low scores (0.1 or 0.2), these are reasonable given the code's nature. However, since the code is a standard parser with no malicious activity, the risk score should be even lower—ideally 0.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard implementation of the shunting yard algorithm, used internally within Patsy for formula parsing.\n- No signs of supply chain tampering, malicious payloads, or obfuscation.\n- The origin attribute is used solely for error reporting, not malicious purposes.\n- The parser handles untrusted tokens safely, as expected in a parsing library.\n\n### **Recommended Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (confirmed no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**Conclusion:** The original assessments are reasonable but could be slightly more conservative regarding the risk score. Given the evidence, I would set all three scores to zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n- No malicious or obfuscated activity.\n- The risk is minimal; scores should be zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk categories.",
