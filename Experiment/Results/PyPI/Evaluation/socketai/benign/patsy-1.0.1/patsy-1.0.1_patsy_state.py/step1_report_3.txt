  "purpose": "Define stateful data transformation classes and a decorator for creating such transforms, including centering and standardizing data.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules; class methods that process input data (memorize_chunk, transform).",
  "sinks": "transform methods output processed data, but no untrusted data flows directly to external systems or insecure endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through memorize_chunk into internal state variables, then transform applies calculations based on stored state to produce output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; the code uses standard numpy operations and patterns for data transformation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard data preprocessing transforms (centering and standardization) with stateful classes and a decorator. The memorize_chunk methods accumulate data statistics, and transform methods use these to output processed data. No network activity, code injection, or malicious side effects are present. The code structure is typical for data processing libraries, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior detected. The code appears to be well-structured, intended for reliable, incremental data transformations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, intended for data preprocessing, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs statistical computations for data centering and scaling, consistent with typical data science libraries. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leakage. The overall security risk is very low.",
