{
  "purpose": "Provide stateful transformation classes for data preprocessing such as centering and standardizing, used in statistical modeling.",
  "sources": "Imports from functools, numpy, and patsy.util; class methods and functions handling data transformations.",
  "sinks": "transform methods potentially outputting processed data; no explicit data sinks or network interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through memorize_chunk (to accumulate stats), then transform (to produce processed output).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is well-structured and standard for data preprocessing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines stateful data transformation classes following a common pattern: they accumulate statistics in memorize_chunk, finalize in memorize_finish, and perform transformations in transform. All imported modules are standard, and no network, file, or environment variable operations are present. The code appears to be normal implementation of data preprocessing routines, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The commented-out classes do not introduce hidden behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious obfuscation techniques are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of data transformations for centering and standardizing. There are no signs of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or malicious data leaks. It’s likely safe for use within a larger statistical or machine learning pipeline.",
