{
  "purpose": "The code implements stateful data transformation classes and functions (such as centering and standardization) for data preprocessing, primarily in statistical modeling contexts.",
  "sources": "Input data is read through methods like memorize_chunk and transform, with data passed via parameters such as 'x' in class methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flows occur in transform methods where data is processed; however, no data leaves the process externally or over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from memorize_chunk (which accumulates data statistics) to transform (which applies calculations to data), with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. The code follows standard statistical transformation procedures. Commented-out classes and code are benign. No obfuscated or complex code patterns that suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard data transformation classes with methods for accumulating data statistics and applying transformations. No network calls, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution are present. Functions and classes perform straightforward calculations (mean, standard deviation, centering). No hardcoded secrets or suspicious imports are used. The code is well-structured and appears to be a legitimate implementation of data preprocessing routines without malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of data transformation functions with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs common statistical operations with no external data transmission or hidden behaviors. Overall security risk is low.",
