  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent implementation of data normalization routines with no malicious intent or suspicious features. The security risk is minimal, and no obfuscation or malware signals are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content."
