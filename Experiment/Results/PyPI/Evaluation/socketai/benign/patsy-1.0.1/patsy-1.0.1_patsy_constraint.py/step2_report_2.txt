  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is a standard, well-structured implementation for handling linear constraints, with no malicious behavior detected. It emphasizes the use of parsing, numpy arrays, and validation, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's core functions—parsing constraint strings, creating numpy arrays, and managing constraints—are typical for a statistical modeling library. The report correctly notes that parsing is controlled and limited to specific tokens and operations. No network activity, system modifications, or hidden behaviors are evident.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code appears clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, mainly due to the potential risk if untrusted input is processed, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard parsing, validation, and no external side effects. The code appears legitimate with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's behavior. The parsing and evaluation are confined to mathematical expressions, with no external I/O or system calls.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, as with the previous report.\n\n**Conclusion:** The analysis is accurate. No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate implementation for parsing and managing linear constraints, with thorough validation and testing. No malicious behavior is detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are standard, with input validation, exception handling, and no external system interactions. The parsing uses regex and tokenization, which are controlled.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no significant security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correctly assessed; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard parser and handler for linear constraints, with validation and tests. No signs of malicious payloads or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The detailed analysis matches the code's structure. The parsing logic is typical, and no external effects are present.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate implementation with no signs of malicious behavior. It processes input data securely, with validation and no external system calls.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's behavior. The only potential concern is processing untrusted input, but the code employs validation and controlled parsing.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — still very low, but slightly higher than others, possibly due to the parsing of user-provided strings.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or hidden behaviors.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and well-structured.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varies between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting minimal potential risk if untrusted input is processed. Given the controlled parsing and validation, these are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is transparent and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — very low, acknowledging that parsing untrusted input always carries some minimal risk, but the code's validation minimizes this.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and justified. The code is a standard, safe implementation for handling linear constraints in a statistical modeling context. No security risks or malicious behaviors are evident.",
