{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class and functions to handle linear constraints for statistical modeling, including parsing, creating, and combining constraints.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, string parsing functions, and user-provided constraint expressions or mappings.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include error handling that raises exceptions; no network or file I/O; no apparent data exfiltration or external command execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs or data structures into parsing functions, then into evaluators and constraint constructors, with no external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior. Uses standard numpy operations and parsing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a well-structured implementation of linear constraint parsing and representation for a statistical modeling library (patsy). It performs validation on input shapes, supports various input formats, and includes test functions for correctness. No network, file, or system commands are used. Error handling relies on raising exceptions for invalid inputs. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms. The parsing functions utilize regex and tokenization, but nothing indicates obfuscation or malicious intent. The code appears consistent with legitimate statistical constraint handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of parsing and managing linear constraints for statistical modeling, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It performs input validation, parsing, and combination of constraints as expected, with no external or covert activities.",
