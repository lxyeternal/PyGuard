  "purpose": "Implementation of spline basis functions (natural, cyclic, tensor product) for generalized additive models (GAMs), allowing flexible non-linear modeling with optional constraints such as centering.",
  "sources": "User inputs such as x, knots, constraints, and parameters for knot placement; internal data structures for knots and constraints; no external data sources or I/O beyond function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Design matrices returned for modeling; no external system interactions, network activity, or file I/O; computations are self-contained.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into basis function computations, which generate design matrices; constraints are incorporated via linear algebra operations; results are returned for modeling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected. Usage of standard scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, pandas). Constraints are handled via typical linear algebra methods.",
  "analysis": "The code provides well-documented, standard implementations of spline basis functions, including natural, cyclic, and tensor product splines, with support for constraints like centering. It performs data validation, uses established numerical methods, and includes test functions validating correctness. No external communication, file access, or obfuscated code is present. The design aligns with known algorithms from 'mgcv' in R, and the code structure is clear and maintainable. Given the absence of malicious patterns, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscation, the code appears to be a legitimate scientific implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of spline basis functions used in statistical modeling. No malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation is evident. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). The code relies on trusted libraries and performs mathematical operations consistent with its purpose.",
