  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the script is a straightforward documentation consistency checker.\n- No malicious activity, external network calls, or obfuscated code is identified.\n- The script performs safe file I/O, regex parsing, and module import with fallback.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The purpose and analysis are consistent across reports, emphasizing the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly reads the documentation file, extracts symbols, imports the package, and compares symbols.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected. No network, no code injection, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.\n- **Security risk:** No evident security vulnerabilities or attack vectors.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The dynamic import fallback with `sys.path.append(root)` is standard for testing scripts and does not introduce security concerns.\n- The regex parsing is straightforward and only extracts documentation directives and symbols.\n- The script only outputs to stdout and sets exit codes accordingly.\n\n### Scoring justifications:\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious code or activity.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk (0):** No vulnerabilities or risky operations.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The reports' scores seem appropriate.\n- No changes needed; the analysis aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, well-understood documentation validation script with no signs of malicious or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the script as a harmless documentation consistency checker. The current scores are justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
