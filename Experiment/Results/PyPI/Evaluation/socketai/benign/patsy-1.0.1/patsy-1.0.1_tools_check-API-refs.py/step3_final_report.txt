  "purpose": "Check consistency between patsy's __all__ and its documentation references in an external .rst file.",
  "sources": "Reading the documentation file, extracting symbols via regex, importing patsy module, and accessing patsy.__all__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script only reads local files and modules.",
  "flows": "Reads documentation -> extracts symbols -> imports patsy -> compares symbols -> outputs discrepancies.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with standard practices. Minor sys.path modification for import fallback, but this is typical in testing scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a benign documentation check, involving file I/O, regex parsing, module import with fallback, and set comparisons. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The code is compatible with both Python 2 and 3. The sys.path modification is a common pattern in testing scripts and does not pose security risks. The regex accurately extracts documentation directives and symbols. The script reports missing or extra documentation symbols and exits accordingly. Overall, the script is simple, transparent, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a harmless, straightforward documentation verification tool with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with its behavior.",
