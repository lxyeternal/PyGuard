{
  "purpose": "The script verifies consistency between the documented symbols in a reStructuredText documentation file and the __all__ attribute of the 'patsy' Python package to ensure documentation accuracy.",
  "sources": "The code reads the documentation file at 'patsy_ref' and the 'patsy' package's __all__ attribute. It also reads input from the filesystem when opening files.",
  "sinks": "The script outputs results to standard output using print statements and may exit with a status code. No untrusted data is used in sensitive operations or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the documentation file and the 'patsy' package into the comparison logic, with outputs generated based on the comparison results.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code performs straightforward file reading, regex matching, set operations, and printing results.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static analysis by reading a documentation file and comparing its documented symbols with the package's __all__ attribute. It handles import fallback by appending to sys.path. The core logic is simple and benign, involving file I/O, regex matching, and set comparisons. No external network calls, code injection, or hidden behaviors are present. The code maintains compatibility with both Python 2 and 3, which is a standard practice but does not introduce malicious complexity. Overall, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a documentation consistency checker for the 'patsy' package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It is a straightforward script used for maintaining documentation accuracy.",
