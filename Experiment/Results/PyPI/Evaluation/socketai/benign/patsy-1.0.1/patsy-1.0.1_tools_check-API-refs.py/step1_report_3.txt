  "purpose": "The script verifies the consistency between the documentation references and the __all__ exports of the 'patsy' module.",
  "sources": "Reads the documentation file at 'doc/API-reference.rst' and imports the 'patsy' module to access '__all__'.",
  "sinks": "Printing to stdout; no untrusted data sinks that could cause harm; no data leaks or code execution based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads documentation file -> extracts documented symbols; imports 'patsy' -> compares exported symbols -> outputs discrepancies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code performs straightforward documentation validation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and determines the root directory. It compiles a regex to parse documentation directives. It reads the documentation file and extracts documented symbols, ignoring certain directives. It attempts to import 'patsy' and falls back to appending the root directory to sys.path if import fails. It compares symbols listed in 'patsy.__all__' with documented symbols, reporting missing or extra documentation entries, then exits accordingly. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a harmless documentation consistency check without malicious intent or security risks. No malware or security threats are identified.",
