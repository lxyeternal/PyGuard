{
  "purpose": "The code defines a unit test for creating an AWS IAM policy document with specific conditions using the awacs library.",
  "sources": "The code reads static imports, such as aws and s3 modules, and test input data within the test method.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs JSON policy data; no external untrusted data sources or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the test data into the aws.Condition and aws.PolicyDocument objects, then serialized into JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code only constructs data structures for AWS policies.",
  "analysis": "The script imports known safe libraries (json, unittest, awacs modules). It creates a test case that constructs an AWS policy with specific conditions, which are all static and safe. There are no external inputs, no network operations, and no code execution based on untrusted data. The code appears to be a straightforward unit test for AWS policy generation, with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for AWS policy creation using the awacs library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only manipulates static data and generates a JSON policy structure.",
