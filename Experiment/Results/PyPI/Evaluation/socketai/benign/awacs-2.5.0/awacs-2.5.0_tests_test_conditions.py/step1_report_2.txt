{
  "purpose": "The code defines a unit test for constructing an AWS IAM policy document using the 'awacs' library, specifically testing the 'Condition' with 'ForAllValuesStringLike'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings, list literals, and library functions to build the policy.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a JSON representation of the policy via 'pd.to_json()', but this is part of test verification and not a data sink for untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code flows from static data (strings/lists) into the construction of AWS policy objects, then serializes to JSON for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behavior. Usage of a well-known library (awacs) for AWS policy creation. No network, file, or system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test that constructs an AWS IAM policy with specified conditions. It uses only static literals and library calls to create the policy objects, then serializes and compares the JSON output. No user input, no dynamic data, and no malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or data leaks. The purpose appears to be verifying correct policy serialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test for AWS policy generation, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
