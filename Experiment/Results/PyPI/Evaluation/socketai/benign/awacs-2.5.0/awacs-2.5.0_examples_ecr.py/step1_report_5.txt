  "purpose": "Generate an IAM policy for Amazon ECR read-only access using the awacs library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for awacs.ecr and awacs.aws modules; creation of Policy object with statements.",
  "sinks": "The to_json() method that outputs the policy in JSON format.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> define policy statement -> generate JSON output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. Use of '*' resource could be overly permissive but is typical for read-only policies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific AWS policy-related modules and constructs a read-only IAM policy for ECR with broad resource access ('*'). The policy is then serialized to JSON. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code appears straightforward and intended for permission policy generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose is to generate a standard AWS IAM policy for ECR read-only access. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. Usage of wildcard resource access is common in such policies, but should be reviewed for least privilege in production.",
