  "purpose": "Generate an AWS IAM policy for ECR read-only access using the awacs library.",
  "sources": "Static code defining policy actions and resource scope; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "Outputting JSON representation of the policy; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Code constructs policy object from imported modules, then serializes to JSON for output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Resource=[\"*\"] which is permissive but common in example policies; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports AWS policy modules, creates a read-only policy with broad resource scope, and outputs the JSON. No input validation, secrets, or network activity are involved. The policy is static and straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws beyond permissiveness. The broad resource scope ('*') is typical for examples but could be overly permissive in production. All reports correctly assign malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and low security risk (~0.1), reflecting the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard example of AWS IAM policy creation. No malicious intent or obfuscation is present. The permissiveness of resource scope is noted but not considered malicious. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is safe for use as an example.",
