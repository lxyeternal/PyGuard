  "purpose": "Generate an AWS IAM policy for SQS queue permissions with specific conditions.",
  "sources": "aws IAM policy components, input parameters for policy and statements, hardcoded IP ranges, fixed date strings",
  "sinks": "Policy serialization to JSON",
  "flows": "Policy object creation -> Policy.to_json() -> output JSON string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Use of fixed dates and IP ranges may limit flexibility but not malicious. No suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an AWS IAM policy for an SQS queue, specifying permissions for a specific principal with conditions based on date and IP address. The policy is then serialized to JSON and printed. No input from untrusted sources, no data leaks, or malicious network activity are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward policy definition with no signs of sabotage, malware, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code generates a legitimate IAM policy object for AWS SQS with predefined conditions. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a standard policy creation script without malicious intent.",
