{
  "purpose": "Generate an AWS IAM policy for SQS with specific conditions for allowing actions from a particular principal and IP ranges within a specified time window.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'awacs' modules, variable definitions for region, account, and policy details.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(pd.to_json())' output which serializes the policy object to JSON format.",
  "flows": "The policy object is constructed from static inputs; no external data sources are read at runtime. The 'to_json()' method serializes the in-memory policy object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; static IP addresses and time constraints are benign and typical for policy definitions; no suspicious code structures or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports AWS policy construction libraries, defines region and account identifiers, and creates a policy object with a specific statement. The statement specifies permissions for a principal to send messages to an SQS queue, constrained by source IP ranges and a time window. The policy is serialized and printed. All values are static and conventional for policy creation, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, legitimate AWS IAM policy definition for controlling SQS queue access. No malicious behaviors, malware, or security risks are evident based on the provided code. It is a typical policy configuration snippet.",
