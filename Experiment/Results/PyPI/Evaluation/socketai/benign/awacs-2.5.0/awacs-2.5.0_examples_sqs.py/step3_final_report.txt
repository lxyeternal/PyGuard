  "purpose": "Generate an AWS IAM policy with static parameters for region, account, principal, and conditions, then serialize to JSON.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded region, account, principal, date conditions, IP ranges",
  "sinks": "Output JSON string of the policy",
  "flows": "Code constructs policy object from static data, serializes to JSON, and prints",
  "anomalies": "Use of outdated date (2010), static parameters, no dynamic input or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code creates a static AWS IAM policy with fixed parameters, including an old date and specific IP ranges. It does not involve external inputs, secrets, or network activity. The code is syntactically correct and straightforward. The outdated date is a misconfiguration but not malicious. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The policy is serialized and printed, which could be misused if exposed but is not inherently malicious. The static nature and lack of external data suggest benign intent. Scores reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and very low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static AWS IAM policy creation script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The only concern is the outdated date, which is a configuration issue, not a security threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is approximately 0.1, consistent with the analysis.",
