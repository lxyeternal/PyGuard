  "purpose": "Generate an AWS IAM policy for an SQS queue with specific permissions, conditions, and principals.",
  "sources": "Reading static string values for region, account, policy ID, principal, and condition parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a JSON representation of the policy via pd.to_json(). No untrusted data sources or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Static data initializes policy parameters; the policy object is constructed and serialized to JSON. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears to be standard IAM policy construction with hardcoded values for testing or configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific AWS policy components from the awacs library, constructs a policy object with predefined principals, actions, resources, and time/IP conditions. The policy is then serialized to JSON for use. No dynamic inputs, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. All values are hardcoded strings, likely for predefined policy deployment. The use of static IP ranges and timestamps suggests a controlled, predictable policy configuration. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward construction of an AWS IAM policy for SQS with specified permissions, not malicious or suspicious. It appears to be part of an automated or manual infrastructure setup script.",
