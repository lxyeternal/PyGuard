  "purpose": "Constructs an AWS IAM policy granting broad permissions to SDB and S3 services on a specific S3 bucket resource.",
  "sources": "Static code defining actions and resources; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "The generated JSON policy output; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Policy object creation with specified actions and resources, serialization to JSON, and output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward policy construction with broad permissions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'awacs.aws' library, creates a policy with a single statement granting 'Allow' effect for all actions ('*') on 'sdb' and 's3' services, restricted to a specific S3 bucket resource. It then serializes and prints the policy. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is detected. The permissions are broad but explicitly defined, representing a typical policy template. The code is static, clear, and free of external inputs or network operations. The security concern lies solely in the scope of permissions, not malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score should be adjusted to approximately 0.35 to reflect the permissiveness of the actions, which could be risky if misused in production. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9-1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static policy generator with broad permissions that could pose security risks if misused but does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The scores are appropriate, with a slight increase in security risk to account for the permissions scope.",
