{
  "purpose": "Generate an AWS IAM policy granting permissions for SDB and S3 actions on a specific S3 bucket.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'awacs.aws' module; Policy object creation; Statement object creation; Action and Resource parameters; print statement",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code outputs a JSON policy but does not perform network or system operations",
  "flows": "Import of library → Policy and Statement creation with allowed actions → Output of policy as JSON",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of wildcard '*' in actions, which grants broad permissions, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a library to construct AWS IAM policies, defines a policy that allows all SDB and S3 actions on a specific S3 bucket, and outputs the policy as JSON. The use of wildcards in actions grants broad permissions but is a common pattern in policy generation, not necessarily malicious. No input sources, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a straightforward policy generator.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign script that constructs and outputs an AWS IAM policy allowing broad access to SDB and S3 resources on a specific bucket. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
