  "purpose": "Generate an AWS IAM policy allowing full access to SDB and S3 services for a specific S3 bucket.",
  "sources": "Code reads static strings and class/method calls from the awacs.aws library.",
  "sinks": "The to_json() method outputs the policy as a JSON string.",
  "flows": "Static data (policy definitions) are passed through object creation and then serialized via to_json().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code detected. The policy grants broad permissions but this is a legitimate configuration for authorized access.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an IAM policy object with wide permissions for SDB and S3. The Resource is limited to a specific S3 bucket. The code then outputs the JSON representation of this policy. No input, no external data sources, no obfuscated code, or suspicious operations are present. The use of the awacs library is standard for defining AWS policies. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script generates a permissive AWS policy for specific resources. It appears legitimate, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity detected. The broad permissions may be a security concern in practice but are not malicious per se.",
