{
  "purpose": "Generate an AWS IAM policy allowing full access to SDB and S3 services on a specific S3 bucket.",
  "sources": "Import statement from awacs.aws; Policy and Statement object creation; pd.to_json() method call",
  "sinks": "pd.to_json() outputs the policy in JSON format; no other sinks present",
  "flows": "Import -> Policy and Statement objects -> Policy construction -> Output via to_json()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior; policy grants broad permissions but is explicit and controlled",
  "analysis": "The code imports AWS policy building classes from awacs.aws, constructs a policy granting all actions (*) on sdb and s3, but limits resources to a specific S3 bucket. The policy is then serialized to JSON and printed. There are no indications of malicious intent, no code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behaviors. The permissions are broad but confined to specific resources, which is typical for policy definitions. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code constructs a standard AWS IAM policy granting specific permissions and outputs it in JSON format. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code segment.",
