{
  "purpose": "The code generates an AWS IAM policy allowing a specific principal to send messages to an SQS queue if the request originates from a specific SNS topic.",
  "sources": "The code reads static variables defining region, account, and specific AWS resource ARNs. No external input is read.",
  "sinks": "The policy object created may be used in AWS IAM or resource policies, potentially affecting permissions if misused.",
  "flows": "The static policy configuration flow is from defined variables to the creation of the Policy object with specific permissions and conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code solely constructs a policy; no suspicious dynamic code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. No network calls or system modifications are involved.",
  "analysis": "The script imports AWS policy libraries and defines static variables for region and account IDs. It constructs a policy allowing a specific AWS principal to send messages to an SQS queue, conditioned on the request originating from a specified SNS topic. The policy is generated in JSON format and printed. The code appears to be a straightforward IAM policy generator without any malicious behavior or suspicious code. There are no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious activity. The static data and the purpose are aligned with legitimate AWS permission management tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign policy generation script for AWS IAM permissions. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply automates the creation of a specific IAM policy configuration.",
