{
  "purpose": "Generate an AWS IAM policy allowing a specific SNS topic to send messages to an SQS queue for a particular AWS account.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining region, account, and resource identifiers; imported modules",
  "sinks": "The Policy object creation and its JSON serialization",
  "flows": "Initialization of Policy object with Statement including Principal, Action, Resource, and Condition parameters; then serialization to JSON",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive data; no code that executes untrusted input; static resource ARNs and principals",
  "analysis": "The code imports AWS policy construction modules and defines a policy granting SNS permissions to an SQS queue. It specifies static ARNs and parameters, constructing a policy with a principal, action, resource, and condition. The policy appears syntactically correct and intended for IAM permission setup. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present; no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, or data exfiltration behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code generates a standard AWS IAM policy allowing SNS to send messages to SQS with specified conditions. It appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is a typical policy definition script without security concerns.",
