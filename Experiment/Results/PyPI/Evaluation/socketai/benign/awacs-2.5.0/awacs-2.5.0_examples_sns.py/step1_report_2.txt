{
  "purpose": "Generate an AWS IAM policy allowing a specific principal to send messages to an SQS queue when triggered by a specific SNS topic.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded region, account ID, principal ID, resource ARNs, and policy parameters from static strings.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a JSON string representing the policy; no external data or untrusted input is used.",
  "flows": "The static input data flows into the Policy and Statement objects, resulting in a JSON output; no untrusted data flow or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports AWS policy-related modules from the 'awacs' library and constructs a static policy object with fixed values for region, account IDs, and resource ARNs. It does not include any user input, network calls, or dynamic execution. The policy grants permission for a specific AWS principal to send messages to an SQS queue when triggered by an SNS topic, which is a common and legitimate AWS permission pattern. The code ends with printing the policy in JSON format, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior. Overall, this appears to be a benign policy generation script without malicious or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, legitimate script for generating an AWS IAM policy. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for standard AWS permission management.",
