  "purpose": "Generate an AWS IAM policy allowing SNS to SQS message sending with specific source restrictions.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded AWS region, account IDs, and constructs ARNs for SNS topic and SQS queue.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output or network operations, only constructs a JSON policy object.",
  "flows": "No external or untrusted data input; the flow is static, from hardcoded variables to policy generation.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses hardcoded AWS resource identifiers and account IDs, which could be sensitive if misused, but no secret or credentials are present. No obfuscation or suspicious language features.",
  "analysis": "The script imports AWS policy construction modules from 'awacs', sets fixed region and account IDs, then creates a policy allowing a specific principal (user or role) to send messages to an SQS queue, restricted by a source SNS topic. The policy is then serialized to JSON. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network activity. The hardcoded resource ARNs could pose a security concern if misused outside a controlled environment, but within this code, it merely constructs a policy. No dynamic input, external data, or potentially malicious code execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code safely constructs a specific AWS IAM policy with hardcoded identifiers. There is no malicious intent or malicious behavior detected. The main concern is the use of hardcoded resource identifiers, which should be managed securely but do not imply malicious activity.",
