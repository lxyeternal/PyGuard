{
  "purpose": "The code constructs an AWS IAM policy allowing a specific principal to send messages to an SQS queue conditioned on the source SNS topic.",
  "sources": "Static variables defining region, account, resource ARNs, and principal IDs.",
  "sinks": "The generated policy JSON output; no untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Static variables used to build a Policy object, which is then serialized to JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and lacks obfuscation or dynamic input.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static script that creates an AWS IAM policy with hardcoded resource ARNs and principals. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated/malicious code. The purpose aligns with standard AWS permission configurations. No vulnerabilities, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.2) are appropriate, considering the static resource identifiers which could be sensitive if misused but are not malicious. The high confidence scores are justified given the code's clarity and simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static IAM policy generator with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main concern is the use of hardcoded resource identifiers, which should be managed securely but do not constitute a security risk by themselves. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
