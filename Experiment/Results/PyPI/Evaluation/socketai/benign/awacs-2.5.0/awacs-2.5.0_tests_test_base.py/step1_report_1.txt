  "purpose": "Unit testing classes and properties related to AWS policy document structures and AWS helper functions.",
  "sources": "Imports (json, unittest, awacs, awacs.aws), class initializations, method definitions, attribute access.",
  "sinks": "json.dumps() serialization, class attribute access, exception raising.",
  "flows": "Method calls serialize class instances to JSON; class attributes accessed and modified; exceptions raised on invalid properties.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit tests for AWS property classes and helper functions, using json serialization and type checks. The to_json method uses awacs.awsencode for encoding but no data leakage or malicious behavior. The class structure appears typical for testing purposes. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard unit testing code for AWS policy objects with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any unsafe operations or data exfiltration. Overall, the code is benign and for testing purposes only.",
