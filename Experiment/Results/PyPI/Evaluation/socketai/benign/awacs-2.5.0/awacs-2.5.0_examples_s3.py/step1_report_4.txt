  "purpose": "Generate an AWS IAM policy for S3 bucket access with specific permissions and conditions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'awacs.s3' and 'awacs.aws', and the 'Policy' object creation.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(pd.to_json())' output which exposes the policy data.",
  "flows": "Code imports libraries, constructs the policy object, then serializes and outputs it as JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Usage of string interpolation with AWS variables is standard for IAM policies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports AWS policy construction libraries, creates a policy with multiple statements granting S3 permissions, and serializes the policy to JSON. The policy specifies allowed actions, resources, and conditions using AWS variables. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is present. The use of AWS variables within policy statements is standard practice for IAM policies. The output is a JSON-formatted policy document, typical for such configurations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward example of generating an AWS IAM policy for S3 permissions, with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues. It simply constructs and outputs a policy document as intended.",
