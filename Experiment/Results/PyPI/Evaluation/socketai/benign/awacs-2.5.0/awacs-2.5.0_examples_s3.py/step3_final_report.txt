{
  "purpose": "Constructs an AWS IAM policy with multiple statements for S3 access, using awacs library and AWS variables.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input; static code defining policy statements and conditions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the policy as JSON via pd.to_json(), no data leaks or external calls.",
  "flows": "From policy object creation to JSON serialization; no external data flow or user input.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard AWS variables like ${aws:username}; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward IAM policy construction script utilizing the awacs library. It defines multiple permission statements with conditions involving AWS variables, typical in AWS policy templates. No malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. The use of AWS variables is standard practice, and the output is a JSON string of the policy. The code does not perform any runtime actions, network calls, or contain hidden backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example of AWS IAM policy creation with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are consistent with its straightforward, well-formed structure. No modifications are necessary.",
