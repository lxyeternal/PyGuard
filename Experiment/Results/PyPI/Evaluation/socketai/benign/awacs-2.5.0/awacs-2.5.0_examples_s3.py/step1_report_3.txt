{
  "purpose": "The code generates an AWS IAM policy using the awacs library for S3 permissions, intended for access control management.",
  "sources": "Reads include static string values for bucket ARNs and AWS-specific variables like ${aws:username} used in resource ARNs and conditions.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a JSON-formatted policy string using pd.to_json(). No direct data leaks or external data outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "The policy object is created from static and templated resource ARNs, then serialized to JSON. No untrusted input flows into sensitive actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of AWS variables like ${aws:username} in resource ARNs and conditions is typical in IAM policies; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and follows expected patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the awacs library to programmatically construct an AWS IAM policy with various statements granting S3 permissions, including conditions based on AWS variables. The policy structure appears standard, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The policy is printed as JSON, suitable for use in AWS environments. No external input handling, dynamic code execution, or insecure patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate example of programmatically creating an AWS IAM policy for S3 access with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical use of the awacs library for policy generation.",
