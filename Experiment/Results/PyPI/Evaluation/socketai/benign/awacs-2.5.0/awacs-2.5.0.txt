The only concern is the outdated date, which is a configuration issue, not a security threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is approximately 0.1, consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The core security concern is executing untrusted code via exec() without validation or sandboxing, which poses a significant security risk. The current malware scores are conservative; they should be increased to better reflect the potential danger. The overall security risk should be rated high, around 0.75-0.8, considering the pattern of unsafe code execution. No malicious code is detected in the snippet itself, but the pattern is inherently risky if the files are untrusted."

The scores in the reports are appropriate, except for report 5's risk score, which should be lowered to 0. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured, with no security concerns."
