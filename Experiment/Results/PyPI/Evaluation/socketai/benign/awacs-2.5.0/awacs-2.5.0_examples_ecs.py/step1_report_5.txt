{
  "purpose": "Defines an AWS IAM policy granting permissions related to ECS, ECR, and CloudWatch logs.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'awacs' library for policy creation; no external data input or user input sources.",
  "sinks": "The policy object generated could be used in AWS IAM roles or policies, potentially granting broad permissions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions; the code constructs a static policy object and outputs its JSON.",
  "anomalies": "The policy grants wide permissions ('Resource':['*']) across multiple services, which could be overly permissive. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code found. The pattern is typical for AWS IAM policy generation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific AWS policy classes and constructs a policy granting multiple permissions with effect 'Allow' and resource set to '*', which is very permissive. The code then prints the JSON representation of the policy. There are no input sources, external data flows, or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The use of 'Resource':['*'] could be considered a security risk in real deployments, but not malicious per se. The code appears to be a straightforward, static IAM policy generator with no obfuscated or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple, static AWS IAM policy generator that grants broad permissions. There is no malicious behavior or malware present. The only potential security concern is the overly broad resource scope, but it does not indicate malicious intent.",
