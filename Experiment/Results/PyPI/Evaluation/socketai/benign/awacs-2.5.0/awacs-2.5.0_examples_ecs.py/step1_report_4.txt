  "purpose": "Define an IAM policy allowing various AWS ECS, ECR, and CloudWatch Logs actions.",
  "sources": "The code imports AWS policy statement modules and constructs a policy object; no external input is read.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the policy in JSON format; no data sinks or network activity involved.",
  "flows": "The policy object creation and serialization flow from static definitions; no dynamic data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The policy grants wide permissions with Resource=\"*\" but this is typical for IAM policies, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports AWS policy modules, constructs an IAM policy allowing a broad set of ECS, ECR, and CloudWatch logs actions, and then serializes the policy to JSON. All actions are explicitly specified and do not involve untrusted input. No malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of Resource=\"*\" is typical for IAM policies but could be considered overly permissive; however, this alone is not malicious. There are no external inputs, no network operations, no code injection or obfuscation. The code's purpose is straightforward: create and output a policy document.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example of constructing an IAM policy for AWS services. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It is a standard, safe code snippet demonstrating policy creation.",
