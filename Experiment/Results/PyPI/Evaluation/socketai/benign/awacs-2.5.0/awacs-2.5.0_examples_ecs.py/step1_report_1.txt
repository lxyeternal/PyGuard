  "purpose": "Define an IAM policy allowing various AWS ECS, ECR, and CloudWatch Logs actions, and output it as JSON.",
  "sources": "The Policy object creation and its internal Statement with specified Actions and Resources.",
  "sinks": "The to_json() method call which outputs the policy JSON; no external untrusted data sources are used.",
  "flows": "Policy definition flows into the to_json() serialization, with no external or untrusted data input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code simply constructs and prints a predefined IAM policy with broad resource access.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific AWS IAM policy components, constructs a policy object with broad ('*') resource access, and prints the JSON serialization of this policy. There are no dynamic inputs, external data reads, or suspicious behaviors. The actions included are standard for ECS, ECR, and CloudWatch logs management. The use of '*' in resources indicates overly broad permissions but not malicious per se.",
  "conclusion": "This code constructs and outputs a standard IAM policy with broad permissions. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The main concern is over-permissioning, not malicious intent.",
