{
  "purpose": "Constructs an IAM policy with broad permissions for ECS, ECR, and CloudWatch logs actions, then outputs it as JSON.",
  "sources": "Static import statements and predefined action lists within the code; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The generated JSON policy is printed; no untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Code execution flows from import statements to policy creation, then to JSON serialization and printing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and static. The only notable aspect is the use of '*' in resources, which is typical in example policies but risky in production.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a static IAM policy with specific AWS actions, granting permissions over all resources ('*'). It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic inputs. The broad resource scope is a security concern but not malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, the over-permissioning, and assign appropriate scores. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.2-0.3), reflecting over-permissioning but no malicious intent. The confidence in these assessments is high (around 0.9-1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static IAM policy generator with broad permissions, typical of example code. There is no malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is over-permissioning, not malicious activity. The scores assigned by the reports are consistent and appropriate.",
