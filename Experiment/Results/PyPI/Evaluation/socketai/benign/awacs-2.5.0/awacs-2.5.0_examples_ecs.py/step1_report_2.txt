  "purpose": "Defines an AWS IAM policy granting permissions for ECS, ECR, and CloudWatch Logs actions, and outputs the policy in JSON format.",
  "sources": "Import statements for AWS policy libraries and the creation of the 'pd' policy object.",
  "sinks": "The print(pd.to_json()) statement outputs the generated JSON policy, which could be viewed or intercepted.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Policy object creation -> Output in JSON format",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behaviors. Use of wildcard '*' in Resource is common for policies, not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports AWS policy libraries and constructs an IAM policy with broad permissions ('*' resource) for various ECS, ECR, and logs actions. It then prints the JSON representation of this policy. No user input or external data sources are used, and no suspicious or malicious code behaviors are present. The policy appears to be a generic, permissive policy configuration typical in AWS documentation examples.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward example of creating and outputting an AWS IAM policy with broad permissions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security issues. The use of '*' for resources is typical in example code but could be dangerous in production if misused; however, this alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
