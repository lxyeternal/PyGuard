  "purpose": "To discover and execute all Python scripts within the 'examples' directory for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads Python files from the 'examples' directory using glob and open.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the compiled code from each file using exec(), which can run untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Files are read from disk (source), then compiled, and executed directly in the current process (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code executes potentially arbitrary code from multiple files without validation. Redirecting stdout to /dev/null is unusual but not malicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The script collects all Python files in the 'examples' directory. It then iterates over each file, opening and reading its contents, compiling the code, and executing it within the same process. The standard output is suppressed during execution by redirecting sys.stdout to /dev/null. There are no evident input validation, sandboxing, or restrictions, and executing arbitrary code poses security risks. The use of exec() on untrusted code is inherently dangerous, especially if the source files are not verified.",
  "conclusion": "This code executes all Python scripts found in a directory without validation, which can be dangerous if those scripts are untrusted or malicious. The suppression of stdout is benign but unusual. Overall, executing arbitrary code from files is risky and should be done only with trusted sources.",
