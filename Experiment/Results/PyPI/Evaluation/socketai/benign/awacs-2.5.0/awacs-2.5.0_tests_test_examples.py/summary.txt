  "conclusion": "The core security concern is executing untrusted code via exec() without validation or sandboxing, which poses a significant security risk. The current malware scores are conservative; they should be increased to better reflect the potential danger. The overall security risk should be rated high, around 0.75-0.8, considering the pattern of unsafe code execution. No malicious code is detected in the snippet itself, but the pattern is inherently risky if the files are untrusted."
