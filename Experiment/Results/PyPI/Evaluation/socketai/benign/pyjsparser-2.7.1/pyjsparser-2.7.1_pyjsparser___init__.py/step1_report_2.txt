  "purpose": "Define module exports and metadata for a JavaScript parser library in Python.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; the code only defines variables and imports modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily module setup and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets module attributes (__all__, __author__, __version__) and imports specific classes and modules. There are no operations involving external data, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The imports are standard relative imports of a parser class, a function, an exception class, and a data module. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical Python module initializer, establishing exports and metadata without any malicious or suspicious activity. It appears safe and standard.",
