  "purpose": "Define module exports and metadata for a JavaScript parser library in Python",
  "sources": "Module level attributes (__all__, __author__, __version__), import statements from local modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to sensitive sinks; only static attribute assignment and imports",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets module metadata and imports functions and data from internal modules. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, or network communications. The imports are from relative modules, typical for a package structure. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious code intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization script that sets export variables and imports necessary components. It appears safe with no malicious intent or security risks.",
