  "purpose": "Define module exports and metadata for a JavaScript parser library in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports from local module files: '.parser' and '.pyjsparserdata'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Exports symbols from imported modules without any data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for a module's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns module metadata (__all__, __author__, __version__) and imports key components from internal modules for use elsewhere. It does not process external data, execute code dynamically, or include suspicious patterns. No obfuscation or malicious behaviors are apparent. Its structure indicates typical package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization script that declares exports and metadata. No signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use.",
