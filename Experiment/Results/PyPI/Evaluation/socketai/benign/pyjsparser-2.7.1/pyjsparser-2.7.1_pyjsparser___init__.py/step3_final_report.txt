{
  "purpose": "This code defines module metadata (__all__, __author__, __version__) and imports specific classes and functions from sibling modules for a JavaScript parser library, serving as a package interface.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, user input, environment variables, or network calls; static import statements.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written externally or processed dynamically.",
  "flows": "N/A; static import and metadata assignment without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard module setup with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python __init__.py or module setup file, defining exports and importing components. No dynamic behavior, external data handling, or network activity is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, reflecting the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initialization script for a JavaScript parser library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
