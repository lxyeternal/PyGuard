{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package called 'pyjsparser', facilitating its installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, version, URL, author info, and dependencies directly from the script's source code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this script that process untrusted or external data; it only defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script purely sets package configuration based on static values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import setup from setuptools, falling back to distutils if not available, then calls setup() with package metadata. There are no input streams, user data, or external data sources involved. The metadata appears typical for a Python package. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is simple, standard, and static.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It purely defines package information for distribution.",
