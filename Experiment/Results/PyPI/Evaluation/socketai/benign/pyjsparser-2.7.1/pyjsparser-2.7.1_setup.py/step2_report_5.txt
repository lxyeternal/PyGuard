  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observation:**\nAll reports consistently identify the code as a straightforward Python package setup script. They note the use of standard import patterns, static metadata, and no dynamic or untrusted data processing. The consensus is that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code matches the provided snippet. No discrepancies are noted.\n- **Malicious code or behavior:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Dynamic data or external inputs:** Absent.\n- **Network activity or data exfiltration:** Not present.\n- **Credentials or secrets:** Not present.\n- **Suspicious patterns:** None.\n\n### Critique of the reports:\n- The reasoning is sound; all reports correctly identify the code as a benign setup script.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the analysis.\n- No report suggests any assumption-based vulnerabilities or overlooks any potential issues.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Since all reports agree and the code is standard, no changes to scores are necessary.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, given the static, well-understood nature of the code.\n- The malware score is correctly zero, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is zero, matching the clear code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, safe Python package setup script with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, comprehensive, and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
