  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'pyjsparser'.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, hardcoded package metadata in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Import of modules -> setup() call with static data.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'setuptools' with a fallback, then calls setup() with fixed metadata. No dynamic code, no external data, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns. It follows standard packaging practices and contains no malicious logic or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and high confidence.",
