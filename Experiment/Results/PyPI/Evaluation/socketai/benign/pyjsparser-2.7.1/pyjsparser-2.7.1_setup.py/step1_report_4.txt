{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for the Python package 'pyjsparser' using setuptools or distutils.",
  "sources": "Static code in the setup script; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Installation requirements and metadata are set but do not constitute data sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code does not process untrusted input or data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns are present. The code uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import 'setuptools' for package setup; if unavailable, it falls back to 'distutils'. It then calls setup() with static metadata, including package name, version, URL, author info, and description. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious code patterns. The script appears to be a typical Python package setup file with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical configuration tasks without any suspicious activity.",
