{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the Python package 'pyjsparser', used to specify package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package dependencies and metadata, as well as the import statements for 'setuptools' or 'distutils'.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct untrusted data sinks; the script primarily defines package info.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script imports modules and calls setup() with static data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code uses standard package setup patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'setuptools' and falls back to 'distutils.core' if unavailable, then calls setup() with static metadata for package installation. No dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no sensitive data handling are present. The package appears to be a straightforward setup script, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a typical Python package configuration with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It simply defines package metadata for distribution. Overall, it appears safe.",
