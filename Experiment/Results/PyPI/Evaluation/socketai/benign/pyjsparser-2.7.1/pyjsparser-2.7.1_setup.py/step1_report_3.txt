{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'pyjsparser' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools or distutils, and static setup() call with package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data or input processing.",
  "flows": "Import source flows into setup execution, which then processes static package metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code behaviors. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import 'setup' from 'setuptools', falling back to 'distutils.core' if unavailable. It then calls setup() with static package metadata, such as name, version, URL, author info, and description. There are no dynamic inputs, no code execution based on external data, and no suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a typical setup script for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides package metadata for distribution. No malware or security concerns are identified.",
