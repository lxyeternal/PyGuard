  "purpose": "Defines classes for JavaScript Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) nodes, facilitating parsing and serialization of code structures.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for node construction methods, such as tokens, expressions, and identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Serialization via to_dict; no external data transmission or system calls observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (tokens, expressions) flow into node attributes; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "The __getattr__ method raises exceptions for unsupported features, which is typical in parsers; WrappingNode has an empty constructor, unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs AST nodes with methods setting node types and properties, ensuring structured representation. No network, file, or system command operations are present. The exception handling in __getattr__ manages unsupported features gracefully. The import from '.pyjsparserdata' is likely static data, not suspicious. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The exception in __getattr__ and the empty constructor are standard patterns in parser implementations, not indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of AST node classes for JavaScript parsing. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The exception handling and structure are typical for such utilities, and the import is likely just data. The overall security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is zero.",
