  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for potential issues, and evaluate the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code defines classes for constructing and serializing JavaScript AST nodes.\n- The methods systematically set node types and properties.\n- The import from `.pyjsparserdata` is likely static data or syntax definitions.\n- The `__getattr__` method raises `Ecma51NotSupported` exceptions for unsupported features, which is consistent with parser restrictions.\n- The `node_to_dict` function performs recursive serialization.\n- No network, file, or system command execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- The `WrappingNode` class has an empty constructor, which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report-by-Report Analysis**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as classes for JavaScript AST in Python, for parsing or transpilation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (slightly elevated, but not necessarily justified)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The code is standard AST handling; no malicious activity. The `Ecma51NotSupported` exception is a feature restriction, not malicious. The security risk score of 0.2 seems somewhat high given the benign nature; perhaps a 0.1 or 0.0 would be more appropriate unless there's context not visible here.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on AST construction.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (minimal)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous, no malicious behavior. The note about the empty constructor in `WrappingNode` is acknowledged but not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines classes for JavaScript AST, no suspicious sinks.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Fully benign. No network or dangerous operations. The code's structure is typical for parsers.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar AST node class definitions, no external data transmission.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (again, very low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity. The import is from a local module, likely static data.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar, with emphasis on potential attribute access risks.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious behavior. The use of `__getattr__` raising exceptions is standard for unsupported features, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated in some reports (0.1-0.2), but given the code's nature, these should be closer to 0.0.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard AST node class implementation for JavaScript parsing.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- The exception handling for unsupported features is consistent with parser design.\n- The import from `.pyjsparserdata` is not suspicious by itself.\n- The empty constructor in `WrappingNode` is unusual but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n\n- The malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The security risk score could be lowered to **0** given the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score remains **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|--------------|----------------|\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0**          |\n\n**Overall:** The code is a typical, benign AST utility for JavaScript parsing, with no malicious or security risks detected.",
