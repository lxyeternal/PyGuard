{
  "purpose": "Defines classes and methods for representing and constructing JavaScript AST nodes in a parser or code analysis tool.",
  "sources": "Imports from .pyjsparserdata, class methods that process tokens and node data",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no external data is written or transmitted, no dangerous eval or exec statements",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no untrusted data flow or external communication observed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The class methods systematically assign node properties without dangerous operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive structure for JavaScript AST nodes, with methods to set properties for various node types. It imports data but does not perform any I/O, network communication, or execute untrusted code. The __getattr__ method raises exceptions for unsupported features, indicating compatibility checks rather than malicious intent. No hidden or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors detected. The code appears to be a standard parser node representation with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a structural component for AST node representation, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for parsing or analyzing JavaScript code. No security concerns are identified.",
