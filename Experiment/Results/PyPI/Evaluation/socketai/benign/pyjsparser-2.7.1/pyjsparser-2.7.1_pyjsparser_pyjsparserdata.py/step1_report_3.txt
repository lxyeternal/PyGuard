{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a lexer/parser utility for JavaScript code, defining token types, syntax rules, and character classification functions.",
  "sources": "Imports 'sys' and 'unicodedata'; reads system version info and Unicode characters; uses sets and dictionaries for token and syntax definitions.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily defines constants, functions, and error messages related to parsing.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; functions classify characters and check keywords and syntax.",
  "anomalies": "Contains no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Uses verbose character classification, but no obfuscated code or dynamic code execution. No suspicious network or system actions. No runtime data handling or external input processing observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static utility module defining tokens, syntax rules, character classification functions, and error messages for JavaScript parsing. It performs character category checks, keyword detection, and syntax support listing. No evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malicious network activity. The code appears to be a standard, possibly open-source parser utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign JavaScript parsing utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. It strictly defines constants and classification functions for parsing purposes.",
