  "purpose": "Static utility module defining tokens, syntax node types, Unicode classification functions, and error messages for JavaScript syntax parsing.",
  "sources": "Definitions of token types, syntax node types, Unicode character classification functions, and error message templates.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process external input or data flows into untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is static and does not include data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, well-structured, and contains no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static definitions, constants, and utility functions for parsing JavaScript code, including Unicode handling and syntax node categorization. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or network activity is present. The Unicode classification functions are standard and do not facilitate malicious behavior. The code does not obfuscate or conceal its purpose. Given these observations, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility module for JavaScript syntax analysis, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
