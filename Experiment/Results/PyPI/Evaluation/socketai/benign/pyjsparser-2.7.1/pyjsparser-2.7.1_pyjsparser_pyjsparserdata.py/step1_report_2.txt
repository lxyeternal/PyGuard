{
  "purpose": "The source code appears to define a set of utilities, constants, and classes for tokenizing and parsing JavaScript code, likely as part of a JavaScript parser or syntax checker.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present in the code; it primarily defines constants, utility functions, and classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could be processed or lead to security vulnerabilities such as data leakage or code execution.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines static data, constants, utility functions, and exception classes without processing external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and appears to be a utility module for JavaScript syntax analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code defines tokens, syntax elements, message strings, and utility functions for Unicode and identifier validation, all typical in parser or lexer implementations. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or data manipulation is present. It is a static utility module without suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module intended for JavaScript code analysis or parsing. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
