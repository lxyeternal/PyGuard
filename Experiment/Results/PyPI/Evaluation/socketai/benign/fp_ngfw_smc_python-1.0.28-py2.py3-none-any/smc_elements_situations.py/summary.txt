  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate security configuration module that interacts with APIs to manage detection and matching contexts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, reflecting potential misconfiguration risks but not malicious intent. The malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified given the straightforward, configuration-oriented nature of the code."
