  "purpose": "Static package metadata declarations, including version, author, description, URL, email, and license information.",
  "sources": "Module-level string assignments and comments defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; static variable assignments do not process untrusted input or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, input handling, or external data processing; only metadata and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments and comments, with no functions, input/output, or external interactions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package metadata file with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its nature and assign appropriate scores.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
