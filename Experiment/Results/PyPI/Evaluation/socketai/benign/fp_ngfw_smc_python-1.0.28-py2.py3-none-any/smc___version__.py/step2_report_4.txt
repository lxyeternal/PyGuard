  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the validity of their conclusions and scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports identify the code as solely static metadata declarations with no executable logic, input/output, or data processing.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which seems appropriate given the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**1. Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Metadata declaration for a Python package.\n- **Sources:** Module-level string assignments.\n- **Analysis:** No logic, no data flow, no suspicious features.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is just metadata.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- `malware`: 0 — no malicious code.  \n- `obfuscated`: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- `securityRisk`: 0 — no security risk.\n\n---\n\n**2. Report 2**\n- Similar to report 1, emphasizing licensing and metadata.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- All scores are 0, consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**3. Report 3**\n- Same conclusion: static metadata, no logic.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- All 0, consistent.\n\n---\n\n**4. Report 4**\n- Same analysis: straightforward metadata.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- All 0, consistent.\n\n---\n\n**5. Report 5**\n- Again, only static variable assignments with no external data or logic.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- All 0, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence:** The code is purely static metadata declarations, with no executable logic, data flow, or suspicious features.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected; scores are correctly assigned as 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** None.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned by all reports are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard package metadata, with no security concerns.",
