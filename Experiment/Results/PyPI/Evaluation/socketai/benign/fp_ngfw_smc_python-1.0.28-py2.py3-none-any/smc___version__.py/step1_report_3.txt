  "purpose": "Defines metadata for a Python package related to Forcepoint NGFW Management Center.",
  "sources": "None; all data are static metadata assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains comments and static variable assignments for package metadata such as version, author, description, URL, email, and license. There are no functions, data processing, input handling, or network operations. The code appears to be a standard module metadata file, typical in Python packages. No signs of malicious behavior, secret backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign metadata definition with no malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks identified.",
