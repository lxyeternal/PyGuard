{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility functions for different Python versions and interactions with the SMC (Secure Management Console) system, including version checks and feature support validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information (`sys.version_info`), package imports (`smc`, `re`, `packaging`, `distutils`), and SMC system version details via `smc.administration.system.System().smc_version`.",
  "sinks": "The code raises exceptions (`UnsupportedEngineFeature`) based on version checks, which are not malicious but are control flows for feature support validation. No untrusted data output or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Inputs from system environment and package imports feed into version comparison functions. These functions may raise exceptions if certain conditions are met, based on version checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. The code performs standard version compatibility and feature validation routines. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected. The exception raising is contextually appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on maintaining compatibility across Python versions and interacting with the SMC system's version information. It performs version comparisons and raises exceptions if features are unsupported in certain versions. All functions use standard Python practices for version comparison and exception handling. There are no signs of obfuscated, malicious, or maliciously-inclined code. No data leakage, malicious network activity, or sabotage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and feature validation module for managing system version support. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It appears legitimate and secure, primarily serving as an API utility with no suspicious activities.",
