{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities for Python 2/3 and performs version checks for the SMC system and API, raising exceptions if features are unsupported based on version comparisons.",
  "sources": "Reads system info from smc.session.api_version and smc.administration.system.System().smc_version; imports sys, smc, re, and version handling modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network communication, or external outputs; primarily internal version comparisons and exception raising.",
  "flows": "Version info is retrieved and compared internally; exceptions are raised if conditions are not met; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version check logic with standard exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard compatibility and version validation utility for Python 2/3 and SMC system versions. It performs internal version comparisons, raises exceptions for unsupported features, and handles module imports gracefully. No suspicious patterns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are present. The logic is clear, well-structured, and typical for such utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for internal compatibility and version validation purposes. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
