  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code provides compatibility utilities for Python 2 and 3.\n- It performs version checks for the SMC system and API.\n- It raises exceptions for unsupported features based on version comparisons.\n- No network, file, or user input handling is present.\n- The code imports standard libraries and the 'smc' module, which appears to be part of a larger system management framework.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  The code is straightforward and does not exhibit any issues such as vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or bugs that could lead to security risks.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No significant logical flaws are apparent. The version comparison logic appears correct, and exception handling is appropriate.\n\n- **Scores given to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature. The confidence levels are high, and the obfuscated scores are 0, indicating clarity.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n  All reports assign a risk of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis. No malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as a compatibility utility without malicious intent.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The code is purely utility for version compatibility, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic.\n- The exception raising is standard for feature support validation.\n- The use of version comparison libraries and system calls is typical for such utilities.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall estimate:\nGiven the detailed reviews and the code's benign nature, I concur with the provided assessments. The code is a standard, well-structured compatibility utility with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, benign, and intended for internal compatibility checks.",
