{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility functions for different Python versions and checks related to the 'smc' system, including version comparisons and feature support validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system version info via 'sys.version_info' and retrieves 'smc' system details through 'smc.administration.system.System()'. It also reads version parameters passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "The code raises exceptions ('UnsupportedEngineFeature') based on version checks, but does not perform any data leaks, network operations, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Version info is obtained from 'sys.version_info' and 'smc' system calls; these data influence logic paths that may raise exceptions based on version support.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard Python version handling and exception raising for feature support validation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a compatibility utility that manages version comparisons and feature support checks based on the 'smc' system and Python version. It uses standard libraries ('sys', 're') and imports conditionally from 'packaging' or 'distutils' for version parsing. Functions perform straightforward comparisons and raise custom exceptions if certain features are unsupported in specific SMC versions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, data leaks, network activity, or malicious intent. The logic is transparent and intended for compatibility and validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign compatibility and version check utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly raises exceptions based on version support, which is typical for such modules.",
