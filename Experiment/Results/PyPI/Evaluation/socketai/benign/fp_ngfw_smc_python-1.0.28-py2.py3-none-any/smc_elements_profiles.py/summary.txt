  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate configuration management code with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main operational concern is ensuring that file uploads via _import() are validated and sanitized to prevent malicious scripts from being introduced. Overall, the code appears safe, with a low to moderate risk primarily dependent on external input validation."
