  "purpose": "Configuration management for DNS relay profiles, SNMP, sandbox, user ID, custom scripts, and related security profiles and services.",
  "sources": "External parameters, file inputs in CustomScript._import, class attributes, method parameters, self.data attributes.",
  "sinks": "make_request (network/file upload), ElementCreator (system configuration), make_request (file uploads).",
  "flows": "Data from untrusted sources (file paths, external inputs) into network requests and configuration updates.",
  "anomalies": "The _import method uploads arbitrary files, which could be malicious if files are untrusted; no input validation shown.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard for configuration and profile management within a security system. The primary concern is the _import method in CustomScript, which uploads files; if untrusted files are provided, this could be exploited. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are evident. The code structure is clear and typical for such management modules. The risk score reflects potential misuse of file uploads but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate configuration management code with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main operational concern is ensuring that file uploads via _import() are validated and sanitized to prevent malicious scripts from being introduced. Overall, the code appears safe, with a low to moderate risk primarily dependent on external input validation.",
