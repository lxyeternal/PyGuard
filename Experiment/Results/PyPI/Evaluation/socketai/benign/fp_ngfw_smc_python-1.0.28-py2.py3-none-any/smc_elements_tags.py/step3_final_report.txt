{
  "purpose": "Defines classes representing various security tags, mostly read-only, with some methods to create or modify elements via API requests.",
  "sources": "User input parameters in methods like create, add_element, delete_element, and class instantiation parameters.",
  "sinks": "API request methods (make_request) that send data to external endpoints, potentially exposing data if inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "User-supplied data flows from method parameters into API request payloads, which are then transmitted via make_request.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward SDK-like classes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for managing security tags, with most classes being read-only. The only classes allowing creation or modification are 'FilterExpressionTag' and its methods, which perform API calls passing user input. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The API interactions are standard for SDKs, and no suspicious behavior is evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration or system compromise. The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK component for managing security tags, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. Overall, the code is safe and aligns with its intended purpose.",
