{
  "purpose": "This code initializes logging configurations, manages sessions, and imports submodules related to a security management center (SMC) SDK or API.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include parameters for logger setup (log_level, format_string, path), user input for session retrieval, and package/module imports.",
  "sinks": "Logging output (console or file), session management functions, and dynamic module imports.",
  "flows": "User input (e.g., user parameter) flows into session retrieval functions; log configuration parameters flow into logging setup functions; import_submodules loads various modules dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious domain or network activity, and no unusual behavior. The code uses standard logging and session management patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles logging setup and session management. It uses safe, standard Python logging practices, including NullHandler fallback for logging. Session management functions appear straightforward, retrieving or creating sessions based on user input. The import_submodules function dynamically loads modules in a controlled manner, without suspicious behavior. No data leakage, malicious code, or hidden backdoors are present. The code appears to be part of a larger SDK or API framework intended for secure environment management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for SDK initialization, logging, and module import management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It follows common best practices and does not contain suspicious patterns.",
