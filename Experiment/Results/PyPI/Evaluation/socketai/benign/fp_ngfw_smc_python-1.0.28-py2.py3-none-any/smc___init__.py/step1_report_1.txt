{
  "purpose": "This code configures logging and manages sessions for the 'smc' API, providing functions for session retrieval and logging setup.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'smc.api.session', 'smc.base.util', and local version information; functions for setting loggers; module import submodules",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or output",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed; standard logging and import patterns",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up logging handlers (null, stream, file) and manages sessions via 'SessionManager'. It imports submodules from the 'smc' package for registration. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be standard, configuration, and initialization code for a package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical logging and session management setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior.",
