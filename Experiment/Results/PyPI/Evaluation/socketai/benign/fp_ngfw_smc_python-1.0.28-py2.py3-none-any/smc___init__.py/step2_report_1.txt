  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is primarily about logging setup, session management, and dynamic module importation within an SDK or API framework.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are present.\n- The import_submodules pattern is common in plugin-based architectures, but could pose a risk if external modules are maliciously injected—though nothing in the code indicates malicious intent.\n- The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is standard logging and session management code, with no malicious intent.\n- **Score rationale:** Malware = 0, risk = 0, confidence = 1. This is reasonable.\n- **Potential issues:** None identified; the code is straightforward.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Recognizes the code as SDK initialization, with safe practices. The dynamic import could be a concern if external modules are injected, but given the context, it’s standard.\n- **Score rationale:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.2. The low risk score is justified, considering the potential for malicious module injection but no evidence here.\n- **Potential issues:** The risk score of 0.2 might be slightly conservative; since no external untrusted input is processed, the risk remains minimal.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but acceptable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to previous, correctly notes the standard nature of the code. The dynamic import loop could be a vector if malicious modules are injected externally, but no evidence supports this.\n- **Score rationale:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.2. Reasonable.\n- **Potential issues:** No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as standard logging and session management setup, with no malicious activity.\n- **Score rationale:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.1. The low risk score is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Recognizes the code as typical setup code, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Score rationale:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.0. This is consistent.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal risk. Given the code's nature, these are reasonable.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk, mainly due to dynamic module importation, but without untrusted input, the risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No modifications needed; the scores and reasoning are justified.\n- The code appears to be standard SDK setup code with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and follows best practices for logging and session management. The low risk and malware scores are appropriate.",
