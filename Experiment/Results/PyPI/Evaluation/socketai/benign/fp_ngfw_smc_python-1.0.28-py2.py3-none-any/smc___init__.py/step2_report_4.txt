  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code sets up logging and session management; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Analysis:** The code is standard, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion and scores seem appropriate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on logging and session management; no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** The code uses safe patterns; dynamic module import is standard for plugin systems.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The securityRisk score of 0.2 is justified given the dynamic import loop, which could be a vector if external modules are injected maliciously. However, in this context, it appears controlled. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard initialization routines, no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of backdoors or malicious code; dynamic import is typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Similar to Report 2, the securityRisk score is justified but not high. No malware indicated.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focused on logging setup and session management; no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The low securityRisk score is appropriate. No malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard setup code.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct scores and conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Critical Review:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports assign malware=0, which aligns with the code's content. The code is purely configuration and initialization, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk scores:** The only points of concern are the dynamic module imports and session handling, which could be exploited if external modules are malicious. However, in this context, they are standard patterns, and the risk scores assigned (0.1–0.2) seem reasonable.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis remains conservative and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\nBased on the code and reports, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal risk due to dynamic imports, but standard practice)\n\nThis aligns with the assessments in the reports, perhaps slightly more conservative on risk, but given the context, 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and the conclusions are justified. The code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation, and minimal security risk.",
