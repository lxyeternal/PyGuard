  "purpose": "The code defines classes and methods for managing security infrastructure components such as servers, certificates, log servers, proxies, and PKI operations. It handles configuration, certificate import/export, renewal, and network settings in a standard, legitimate manner.",
  "sources": "Data read from class properties, method parameters, self.data dictionaries, element_resolver functions, and external references for network requests and file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network requests via make_request for certificate operations, renewal, and restart commands; file operations via save_to_file for certificate export; external references for server and certificate configurations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and class attributes flow into network requests and file I/O operations, managing certificates, server configurations, and external PKI interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, and no covert data exfiltration or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs configuration management for security components, including certificate handling, server setup, and TLS settings. It uses standard practices for sensitive data handling, external requests, and file operations. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage signs are present. The operations are consistent with legitimate security infrastructure management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and intended for standard security configuration tasks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious intent. The handling of sensitive data is appropriate, and no suspicious patterns are evident.",
