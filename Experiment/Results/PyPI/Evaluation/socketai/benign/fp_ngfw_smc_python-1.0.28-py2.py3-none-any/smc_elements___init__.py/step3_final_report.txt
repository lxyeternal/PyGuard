{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal Python module containing only license comments and an empty __all__ list, likely acting as a placeholder or boilerplate.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it contains only comments and a variable declaration.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as no executable or data-processing code exists.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only license comments and an empty list, which is unusual but not suspicious or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static module with no executable statements, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present. The absence of code logic, secrets, or network activity indicates a benign placeholder. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No anomalies or risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, boilerplate license header with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
