  "purpose": "The code is a license header and a placeholder for module exports, intended to define the public API of a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code; it is purely a license comment and an empty list definition.",

  "flows": "No data flow exists in this minimal code snippet; it contains only comments and a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is standard licensing and module setup code with no unusual behavior, secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "This code only includes a license comment block and an empty list assignment for __all__, which indicates no public API symbols are exported. There are no data input, processing, or output operations. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident. The code appears to be a template or placeholder for a Python module.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in this code snippet. It functions solely as a license header and a module attribute declaration.",
