  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** The code defines classes for network elements, with data flowing from parameters into JSON payloads and API calls. No malicious or suspicious data handling is evident.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. The logic is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These are reasonable given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears safe, with a very low security risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Similar to Report 1, with API interactions and file I/O for upload/download. No malicious behaviors detected.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No signs of backdoors or malicious code. File handling is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; low risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Same pattern—API calls for resolution and management of network elements.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Standard management functions, API interactions, and file operations.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No malicious code or obfuscation. File operations are typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Similar to others—API calls, data management, no malicious patterns.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly indicate 0. The code is a standard SDK for network element management, with no malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly indicate 0. No obfuscation or hidden code.\n- **Risk Score:** The low scores (0.2) are justified, reflecting minimal security concern based on code review.\n\n**My Final Estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports. No malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports. Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 to 0.3. Slightly above zero due to the presence of API interactions and file operations, but these are standard and not inherently risky.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a well-structured, standard SDK for network element management.  \n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.  \n- Scores are appropriate and justified.",
