  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module that performs some basic operations, possibly related to data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly shown in the provided code fragment; no clear input reading functions or external data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are present in the code fragment provided.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flow paths are identifiable within the given code segment.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain obfuscated constructs, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior. There are no signs of malicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward, with standard syntax and structure. There are no indications of data leaks, insecure operations, or malicious intent. The absence of external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated logic suggests it is a benign utility or module code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code looks standard and safe. Due to lack of context, the confidence level is high that no malicious activity is present.",
