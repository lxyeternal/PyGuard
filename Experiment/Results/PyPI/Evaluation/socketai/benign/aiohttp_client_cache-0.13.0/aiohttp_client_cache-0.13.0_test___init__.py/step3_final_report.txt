  "purpose": "This code appears to be a benign Python module with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from standard variables and functions; no external or untrusted sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present; the code does not process untrusted data in dangerous ways.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows indicating malicious data propagation; the code's data flow is straightforward and benign.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are observed; the code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is incomplete but, based on available snippets and descriptions, shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Confidence in benignity is high due to the lack of suspicious patterns, and no malicious indicators are present. The low security risk score aligns with the benign assessment, and malware score is zero, indicating no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
