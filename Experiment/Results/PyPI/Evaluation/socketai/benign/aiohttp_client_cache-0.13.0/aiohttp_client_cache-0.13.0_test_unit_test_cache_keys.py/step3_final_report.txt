{
  "purpose": "The code contains unit tests for the create_key function, verifying URL normalization, handling of duplicate parameters, and request body serialization.",
  "sources": "Controlled test inputs within the test functions, including URL strings, parameter dictionaries, and request bodies.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks, external system calls, or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into create_key, which generates cache keys; no external or untrusted data flows are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward test code with no signs of obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of controlled, well-structured unit tests for cache key generation, with no external dependencies or malicious intent. The inputs are static and trusted, and the assertions verify expected behavior. No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and security risk: 0 are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite with no security concerns or malicious activity. The assigned scores are accurate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
