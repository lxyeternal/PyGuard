  "purpose": "Importing base test classes for integration testing setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from test.integration modules and the flake8 suppression comment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only imports classes.",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no data flow or execution beyond module import.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable feature is the suppression comment '# flake8: noqa: F401', which is common in test files but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for test classes, with a linter suppression comment. There is no dynamic behavior, data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. The imports are standard for test setup, and the suppression comment is typical. No signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and context indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test setup snippet with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The existing reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign appropriate scores. No adjustments are necessary.",
