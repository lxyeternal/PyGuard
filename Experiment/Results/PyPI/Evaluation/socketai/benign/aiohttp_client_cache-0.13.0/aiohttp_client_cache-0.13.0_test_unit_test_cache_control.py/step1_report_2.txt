{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests and utility functions for managing HTTP cache control, expiration, and URL pattern matching, primarily used in a caching library for HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters, environment variables (for Faker seed), mock objects, and standard library modules like os, datetime, and email.utils.",
  "sinks": "No sinks perform untrusted data execution, system modifications, or external communications. The code involves only data handling and testing logic.",
  "flows": "Input data such as headers, URLs, and environment variables flow through functions to determine cache behavior, expiration times, and URL matching; no external or system-level commands are executed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. The code uses standard testing patterns and utility functions without any obfuscated or hidden behaviors. There are no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. All third-party libraries are used appropriately for testing or utility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of unit tests for cache control logic, expiration handling, header parsing, URL matching, and type conversions. It utilizes mock objects and parameterized tests to verify behavior. No system commands, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of environment variables is solely for seed setting in Faker, with no influence on runtime logic or external systems. All data manipulations are confined within the test and utility functions, with no evidence of malicious activity or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of unit tests and utility functions focused on HTTP cache control behavior. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is zero.",
  "confidence": 1,
