{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests and utility functions for cache control behavior in an HTTP client caching library, verifying expiration logic, header parsing, URL matching, and other cache-related operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, mock objects, test inputs (headers, URLs, datetime values), and static strings within test functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows include URL parsing, header processing, and conditional logic. No untrusted data is directly written to external systems, files, or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input data from environment variables or test parameters is processed through utility functions and decision logic; no untrusted data is sent or stored externally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. The code uses standard testing frameworks and common utility functions. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are observed. The code relies heavily on test mocks and static data for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of comprehensive unit tests for cache control features, including expiration calculations, header parsing, URL matching, and header composition. It employs standard libraries and patterns with no signs of malicious behavior. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. All operations are confined to testing and utility functions. The code appears legitimate and safe, designed solely for testing cache behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of unit tests and utility functions for cache control logic, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard libraries and patterns typical for testing purposes. No malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are identified.",
