{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for cache expiration, header parsing, URL matching, and related cache control logic, primarily reading from environment variables, mock objects, and test data.",
  "sources": "Places where code reads input or data include environment variables for Faker seed, mock response headers, test input data, and environment variables for deterministic testing.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems or perform network operations; data flows are confined within test functions and utility functions, with no external data exfiltration or malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and test inputs feed into utility functions and test assertions; data flows within test functions, mocks, and utility methods, with no external or untrusted data reaching critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. Usage of environment variables is solely for deterministic testing setup, not for malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests and utility functions for cache expiration, header parsing, URL matching, and cache control logic. It uses standard libraries, mocks, and test data. No network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation is evident. The environment variables are used for reproducibility, not malicious intent. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with typical testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a standard test suite for cache control functionalities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is negligible.",
