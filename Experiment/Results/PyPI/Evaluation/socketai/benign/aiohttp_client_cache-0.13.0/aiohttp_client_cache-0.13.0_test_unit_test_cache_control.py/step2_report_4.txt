  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and ensuring consistency, correctness, and security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly states that the code is a suite of unit tests for cache expiration and header parsing, which matches the code content.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external system modifications or data exfiltration are observed; data flows are confined to internal computations and assertions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or suspicious behavior. The code uses mocks and parameterized tests appropriately.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that there's no malicious activity and the malware score is zero aligns with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as utility functions and tests for HTTP cache control. Data sources are standard.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or system modifications; data flows are limited to function inputs and internal processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors. Use of environment variables is only for Faker seed, which is safe.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report rightly states the code is benign with no malware risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as cache control utility functions and tests.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data is used in critical sink operations; data flows are internal.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity. Usage of environment variables is benign.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report's conclusion that there's no malicious activity aligns with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid and accurate. No malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as cache control tests and utilities.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data flows into external systems.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Standard testing patterns, no backdoors, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code is for cache and header utility testing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external system interactions or data leaks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a legitimate test suite with no security risks.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** The code is purely test and utility functions for cache expiration, header parsing, URL matching, and related utilities.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Security Risks:** No external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate. The obfuscated score is 0, also correct.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear, straightforward, and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe, with no signs of supply chain security issues or malware.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a well-structured test suite for cache control functionalities, with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
