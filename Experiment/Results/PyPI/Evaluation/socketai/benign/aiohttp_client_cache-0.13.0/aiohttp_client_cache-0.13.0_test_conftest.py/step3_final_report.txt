  "purpose": "Setup for testing HTTP cache behavior, including fixtures and helper functions for HTTP requests and cache management.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'HTTPBIN_URL', imported modules (os.getenv), temporary file creation (NamedTemporaryFile), constants and configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows into sensitive operations; environment variables are used for configuration but not directly into security-critical sinks.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'HTTPBIN_URL' used in URL construction; temporary files used for cache backend storage; no data flows from untrusted sources into sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of environment variables and temporary files is standard in testing contexts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard testing setup for HTTP caching with fixtures, helper functions, and configuration constants. It uses environment variables for configurable URLs and temporary files for cache storage, which are common practices. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code does not process untrusted data into sensitive sinks or perform network operations that could leak data. The minor risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports due to environment variable usage is justified but does not indicate actual security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores and assessments in all reports are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
