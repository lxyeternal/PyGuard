  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a testing utility for HTTP cache behavior, using environment variables, temporary files, and standard testing fixtures.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no data leaks, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The confidence is high (1).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code content. No issues detected. The score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe use of environment variables and temporary files.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, standard practices, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Confidence is 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.1) possibly due to the use of environment variables, but still benign. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard testing utilities, URL helpers, cache setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no malicious logic, environment variables used for configuration.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar benign setup, no suspicious code, safe resource management.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, environment variables used responsibly.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The confidence is high.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard test setup, no malicious activity, no suspicious code.\n- **Findings:** Uses environment variables, no data leakage, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The low risk score is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior, and scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to environment variable usage, which is standard but slightly increases surface area. Given the benign nature, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports; no malicious code present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 might be slightly more conservative, but given the benign context, current scores are acceptable.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code is a typical testing setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the benign nature of the code. No adjustments needed.",
