  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python module intended for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context or comments, the precise purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, user input, or files, but no explicit sources are identified due to lack of code details.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writing, or execution commands, but none are explicitly visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Without concrete code, no definitive source-to-sink data flow can be identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or unusual code constructs are apparent. The code structure appears standard; no obfuscated or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provided is minimal or absent, preventing detailed analysis. No suspicious functions, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are visible. The lack of context limits confidence in identifying malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign; however, the lack of code details prevents thorough assessment.",
