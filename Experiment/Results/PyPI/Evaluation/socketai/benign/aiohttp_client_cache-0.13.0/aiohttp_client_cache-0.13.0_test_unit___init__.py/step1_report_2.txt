  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be an import and setup script for a Python package, possibly for data processing or functionality extension.",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily from standard library imports and potentially from environment variables if used elsewhere in the module.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system calls are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No evident data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observable in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual or suspicious constructs; it uses standard import statements and normal variable definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard Python module setup with import statements. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious obfuscation. Since the provided code snippet is minimal and only includes imports and basic structure, there is limited scope for malicious activity. No external data sources, network connections, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the given code, there is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign and typical for a Python package setup or module initialization.",
