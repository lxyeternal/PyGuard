{
  "purpose": "This code appears to serve as a minimal or boilerplate setup for a Python package or module, likely involving standard imports without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports, environment variables (if any), or configuration files used during package setup or initialization.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present, as the code is minimal and does not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated patterns, and no suspicious external calls or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting of standard import statements with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The confidence in benignity is high due to the simplicity and lack of suspicious features. Given the minimal code, the security risk remains very low. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.05-0.1) are consistent with the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation detected. The security risk is negligible, and the confidence in this assessment is high. The reports correctly reflect the absence of suspicious activity, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
