  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a straightforward test suite for `CachedResponse`, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- **Assessment:** The code consists of unit tests with mocked responses, verifying headers, content, expiration, etc. No external inputs or system commands are involved. The responses are static and controlled.\n- **Malware / Risk Score Justification:** Given the absence of any malicious payloads, command execution, or data exfiltration, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. The risk score should be minimal, close to 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code content. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a benign test suite with no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** All responses are mocked with static data, and the tests focus on response parsing and validation.\n- **Malware / Risk Score:** Zero, as no malicious code or external exploits are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent with the code; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a set of unit tests verifying response handling, headers, and JSON parsing.\n- **Assessment:** All data is from controlled mock responses. No external or untrusted data sources are involved, and no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Malware / Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is accurate; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—unit tests for response processing with mock data.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; all data flows are from mock responses.\n- **Malware / Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion matches the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a set of tests for response handling, with no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** All responses are simulated; no external data or commands involved.\n- **Malware / Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected across all reports. All responses are mock data, and the code only tests response parsing, headers, and content.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Given the controlled testing environment and lack of malicious payloads, **malware score should be 0**, **obfuscated score 0**, and **security risk negligible (close to 0)**.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard test suite for a web response caching library.\n- It uses mock responses, with no network activity beyond the test environment.\n- No external or untrusted data sources are processed in a malicious way.\n- No code injection, command execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n| Score Type        | Suggested Value | Justification                                                      |\n|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score     | 0                 | No malicious payloads or behaviors detected.                        |\n| Obfuscated Score  | 0                 | Code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.                |\n| Security Risk     | ~0                | No external threats or vulnerabilities evident.                     |\n\n**Summary:** The entire code base appears to be a benign, well-structured test suite with no security risks or malicious intent.",
