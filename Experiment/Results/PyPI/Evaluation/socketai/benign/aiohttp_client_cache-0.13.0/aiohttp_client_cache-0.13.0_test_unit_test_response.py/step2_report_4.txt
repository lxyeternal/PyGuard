  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: presence of malicious code, logical flaws, consistency of scores, and justification for any elevated risk or malware scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a test suite for `aiohttp_client_cache`, testing `CachedResponse`. It reads from mocked responses, verifies attributes, headers, JSON parsing, expiration, etc. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. No issues found. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing response validation, header parsing, JSON decoding, expiration checks. All responses are mocked with static data; no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on response handling, headers, content, and request info. Uses mock responses; no external data or malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies the benign nature. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, response validation, headers, JSON, and response attributes. All data is from controlled mock responses. No malicious logic.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** The code tests response handling, with data from mock server responses. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the code's purpose. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign, controlled test suite.\n- No malicious code, obfuscation, or supply chain sabotage is evident.\n- The scores (malware = 0, risk = 0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no signs of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Note:** The code is a standard test suite for a response handling library, with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in all reports are justified and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, well-understood, and does not pose any security threat. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
