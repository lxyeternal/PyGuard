      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured test suite with no signs of malicious activity. The primary security considerations are the use of eval() on external configuration files and invocation of external scripts, which should be handled cautiously in production but are acceptable here for testing. No malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing utility for verifying multiple Python interpreters. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The primary security consideration is the use of shell=True with dynamically constructed commands, which carries a minor risk if interpreter paths are manipulated. Overall, the script is safe in controlled environments, with a low security risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source style Python test harness with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The potential risk associated with dynamic imports is acknowledged but is a known and accepted aspect of such frameworks. The security risk score of approximately 0.2 is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0."
