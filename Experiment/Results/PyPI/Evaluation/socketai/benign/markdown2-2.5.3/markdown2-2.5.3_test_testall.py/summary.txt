  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing utility for verifying multiple Python interpreters. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The primary security consideration is the use of shell=True with dynamically constructed commands, which carries a minor risk if interpreter paths are manipulated. Overall, the script is safe in controlled environments, with a low security risk."
