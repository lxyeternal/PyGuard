  "purpose": "Setup script for the markdown2 Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, importing markdown2, reading environment variables, and package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of code via entry points, importing external modules, and accessing environment variables.",
  "flows": "import markdown2 -> setup configuration -> entry point execution",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The import manipulation of sys.path is typical for local testing or module loading, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by adjusting sys.path temporarily to import markdown2. It defines package classifiers and optional dependencies. The setup() function configures package details including name, version, author info, URL, license, supported platforms, modules, entry points, descriptions, and requirements. All code follows standard setup script patterns. No external or untrusted data sources are used. The code does not perform any network activity, file modifications, or hidden operations. The manipulation of sys.path is common in setup scripts for local module imports. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging the markdown2 library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, and the structure aligns with typical packaging practices. No security risks or malware indications are detected.",
