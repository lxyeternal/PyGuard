  "purpose": "A Python test harness framework for discovering, listing, filtering, and executing test modules and test cases.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, module attributes (__tags__, __file__), test functions, and dynamically imported modules via importlib.",
  "sinks": "Execution of test functions, dynamic import of modules, modification of sys.path, and potential execution of module code during import.",
  "flows": "Command-line args → test discovery and filtering → dynamic module import → test execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of importlib and sys.path modifications are standard but could execute malicious code if modules are compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python practices for test discovery and execution, with dynamic imports and command-line parsing. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The main security consideration is that dynamic imports can execute untrusted code, but this is typical for test frameworks. The code is well-structured, clear, and uses common patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2) are justified based on the inherent risks of dynamic module loading but do not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source style Python test harness with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The potential risk associated with dynamic imports is acknowledged but is a known and accepted aspect of such frameworks. The security risk score of approximately 0.2 is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0.",
