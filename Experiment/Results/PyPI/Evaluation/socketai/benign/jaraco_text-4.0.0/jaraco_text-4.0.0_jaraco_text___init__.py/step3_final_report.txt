{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for string manipulation, text processing, resource handling, and safe Unicode decoding, intended for benign use in text and resource management.",
  "sources": "Resource files ('Lorem ipsum.txt') accessed via importlib resources; string inputs from function parameters and resource streams.",
  "sinks": "Internal string processing functions; no external data leaks, network communication, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Resource file reading flows into string processing functions; no external data flows or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. Use of ExceptionTrap for Unicode errors is a safe pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard utility functions for string substitution, text wrapping, HTML stripping, and resource handling. It reads static resource files and processes strings without any external communication or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The resource file 'Lorem ipsum.txt' is assumed benign. The use of exception handling for Unicode errors is a safe pattern. The overall structure is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility library for string and resource processing with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent and justified based on the analysis. No further concerns or suspicious activity are evident.",
