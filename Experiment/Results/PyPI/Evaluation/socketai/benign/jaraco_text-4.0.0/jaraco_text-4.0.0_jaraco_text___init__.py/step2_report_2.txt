  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the provided scores, logical consistency, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is benign, utility functions for string manipulation, no malicious activity, malware score 0.  \n- **Score justification:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — aligns with the analysis.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n  - Risk: 0 — no security risk.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent and justified.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Utility functions, safe resource handling, no malicious activity, malware score 0.  \n- **Score justification:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — matches the benign nature.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Risk: 0 — negligible security risk.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.  \n**Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Utility functions, resource file reading, minimal security concern, malware score 0.  \n- **Score justification:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malicious behavior detected.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — slight, perhaps due to resource file handling, but overall very low.  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly above zero risk score, but justified given the resource file reading.  \n**Note:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 seems appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Utility functions, resource handling, no malicious activity, malware score 0.  \n- **Score justification:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — consistent with benign analysis.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — slightly higher, perhaps due to file reading functions.  \n- **Assessment:** The 0.2 risk score is acceptable, considering file I/O potential if misused, but no actual malicious activity.  \n**Conclusion:** The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Utility functions, static resource reading, no malicious activity, malware score 0.  \n- **Score justification:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — aligns with resource file handling.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign utility functions.\n- Malware scores are all zero, which is justified given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated scores are zero, matching the straightforward code.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minor concerns about resource handling but no actual threats.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, primarily due to resource file handling, which could be exploited if resource files are malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**In conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. The code appears to be a benign utility library with no security risks or malicious intent.",
