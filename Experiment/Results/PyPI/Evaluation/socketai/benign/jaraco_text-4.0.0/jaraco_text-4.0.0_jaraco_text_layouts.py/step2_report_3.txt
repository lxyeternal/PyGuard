  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code performs straightforward string translation between QWERTY and Dvorak layouts.\n- No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are reported.\n- The functions are simple, with clear, benign purposes.\n- The only minor point of note is that `_translate_stream()` prints directly to stdout, which is unconventional but not malicious.\n\n**Specific issues:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating strong agreement.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk:** 0 or very close to it (some mention of print behavior being unconventional but not risky).\n\n**Critical points:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- No claims are made based on assumptions; all are based on code analysis.\n- The code's logic is straightforward, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- The code is a simple utility for keyboard layout translation.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security issues are present.\n- The only potential concern is the use of `print()` in `_translate_stream()`, which is benign but unconventional.\n\n**Final scores I would assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the unconventional print, but not significant)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The minimal security risk score reflects the unconventional print statement but does not indicate any threat.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is safe.\n- The scores should remain at 0 for malware and obfuscated, with a very low risk score (~0.1) due to the print statement's nature.\n- No further action needed.",
