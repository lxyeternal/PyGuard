  "purpose": "Provides functions to translate strings and streams between QWERTY and Dvorak keyboard layouts.",
  "sources": "Static translation tables used in str.maketrans for character mapping.",
  "sinks": "The translate() function applies translation; _translate_stream() reads from stream and prints output.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into translate() or _translate_stream(), which then produce translated output; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print() in _translate_stream() is unconventional for a utility function but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static character mappings for keyboard layouts, providing straightforward translation functions. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The functions are simple, transparent, and do not handle sensitive data or perform network operations. The print statement in _translate_stream() is benign but unconventional. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with scores reflecting no malware or obfuscation. The risk scores are minimal, consistent with the code's purpose. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for keyboard layout translation with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores of 0 for malware and obfuscated, and a near-zero risk score, are appropriate. The minor print statement does not pose any security concern.",
