{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to translate strings between QWERTY and Dvorak keyboard layouts, primarily for conversion or educational purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters and stream objects (stream.read()).",
  "sinks": "Uses string.translate() to convert input data based on translation tables. No data is sent externally or to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed via translate(), which applies translation tables; data flows from input sources (parameters or streams) through translation to output (return value or print).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code includes docstring examples, but no obfuscation or suspicious features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines translation tables between QWERTY and Dvorak layouts and applies them to input data. It includes test examples in docstrings for verify correct translation. The _translate_stream function reads data from a stream and prints the translated output. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The functions are straightforward and serve layout translation purposes without any hidden or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing solely on keyboard layout translation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security risks. It appears to be a simple utility script with safe functionality.",
