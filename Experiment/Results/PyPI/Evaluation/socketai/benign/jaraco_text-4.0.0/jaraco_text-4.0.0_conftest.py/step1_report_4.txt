  "purpose": "Set up a compatibility layer for pathlib depending on Python version and define a pytest fixture to wrap temporary paths.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, pytest, tmp_path argument",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> import logic; tmp_path argument -> fixture return value",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward compatibility code and fixture definition",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports pathlib2 or pathlib based on Python version, which is standard practice for compatibility. It defines a pytest fixture that wraps the tmp_path argument in pathlib.Path, which is also standard. There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or data leaks. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility pattern and pytest fixture setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
