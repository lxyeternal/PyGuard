  "purpose": "Static configuration for Sphinx documentation, setting extensions, link patterns, and mappings.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded extension lists, regex patterns for link replacements, static URL templates, and configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "None; static configuration with no untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks as no dynamic or untrusted data is processed.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and standard for documentation setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Sphinx configuration script with predefined extension lists, regex patterns for link replacements, and URL mappings. It does not process user input, external data, or perform any network activity. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The regex patterns serve documentation linking purposes and are static. All indicators point to benign, well-structured configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Sphinx configuration with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and security risk score to 0. The confidence level is 1, given the static and straightforward nature of the code.",
