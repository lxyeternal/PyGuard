{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to strip common prefixes from standard input lines and registers it as an autocommand for execution.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from sys.stdin",
  "sinks": "Writes output data to sys.stdout",
  "flows": "Input from sys.stdin -> strip_prefix() -> sys.stdout.writelines()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Uses external library 'jaraco.text' but no suspicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a function 'strip_prefix' that reads from standard input, processes the lines using 'Stripper.strip_prefix', and writes the result to standard output. The function is registered via 'autocommand' to run automatically. The included docstring has a test, but no code executes that test; it's purely informational. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, credential handling, or obfuscation. The use of an external library 'jaraco.text' appears legitimate for text processing. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple input processing with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward utility for prefix stripping registered as an autocommand, with no malicious or malicious-looking behavior.",
