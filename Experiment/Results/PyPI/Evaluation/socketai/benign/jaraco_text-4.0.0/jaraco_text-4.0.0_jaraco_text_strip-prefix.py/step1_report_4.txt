{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to strip common prefixes from lines of input read from stdin and outputs the result. It also registers this function as an autocommand for the current module.",
  "sources": "sys.stdin (reads input data), autocommand (imported module), jaraco.text.Stripper (imported module for processing)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.writelines (outputs processed data)",
  "flows": "Input from sys.stdin -> Stripper.strip_prefix -> sys.stdout.writelines",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns; use of third-party modules is standard; no obfuscated code; no dynamic code execution; no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and third-party modules, defines a function that processes stdin lines to strip common prefixes using an external library, and outputs the result. It registers this function as an autocommand. The code appears to perform a straightforward text processing task with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The presence of an example test within docstring indicates testing practices but no malicious code. The third-party 'autocommand' and 'jaraco.text' libraries are not inherently suspicious, and the code does not exhibit any behavior that suggests malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing a standard text processing task with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
