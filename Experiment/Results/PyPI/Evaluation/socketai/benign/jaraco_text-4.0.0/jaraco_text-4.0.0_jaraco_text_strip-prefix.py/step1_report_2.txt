  "purpose": "The code defines a function to strip common prefixes from input lines and registers it as an autocommand for execution.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.stdin",
  "sinks": "Writes to sys.stdout",
  "flows": "Input from sys.stdin flows into strip_prefix() via sys.stdin, processed by Stripper.strip_prefix, and results are written to sys.stdout",
  "anomalies": "Uses external 'autocommand' and 'jaraco.text.Stripper' without verification; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code evident; no obfuscation or suspicious dynamic execution; the code appears to be a straightforward utility function.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys for input/output, autocommand presumably for registering functions to run automatically, and jaraco.text.Stripper for processing text. The strip_prefix() function reads input lines from sys.stdin, strips common prefixes using Stripper.strip_prefix, and outputs the result to sys.stdout. It includes a docstring with a test, indicating intended use. The registration of the function as an autocommand suggests it is designed to run automatically in some environment. No external data is fetched, no credentials or sensitive info are hardcoded, and no suspicious code behaviors are present. The use of external libraries appears legitimate and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility script for processing input text by removing common prefixes, registered to run automatically. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. It appears to be a benign, intended utility.",
