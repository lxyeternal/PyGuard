  "purpose": "Read input from stdin, strip common prefix lines using external library, output result, and register the function for automatic execution.",
  "sources": "sys.stdin (input data), external libraries (autocommand, jaraco.text.Stripper)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (output data)",
  "flows": "Input read from sys.stdin -> strip_prefix() processes data -> output written to sys.stdout",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward use of external libraries; docstring with test does not execute code",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries, defines a function that reads from stdin, strips common prefixes with a well-known external library, and writes to stdout. It registers the function with autocommand for automatic invocation. No malicious code, backdoors, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The external library usage is standard, and the code logic is simple and correct. The docstring contains a test but does not execute at runtime. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe operations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for prefix stripping, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The external dependencies are used legitimately, and the code structure is straightforward. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the script.",
