{
  "purpose": "Define a function to strip common prefixes from stdin input and output the result.",
  "sources": "sys.stdin (reading input data), autocommand.autocommand (imported, likely used to register the function).",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.writelines (outputting processed data).",
  "flows": "Input read from sys.stdin → process with Stripper.strip_prefix → output via sys.stdout.writelines.",
  "anomalies": "Use of autocommand decorator suggests dynamic registration, but no suspicious or obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious system commands present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and a third-party module autocommand, then a class Stripper from jaraco.text. It defines a function strip_prefix that reads input from stdin, strips common prefixes, and writes the result to stdout. The function is registered with autocommand, likely for execution upon certain triggers. The code includes a docstring with a test example. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or backdoors. The use of third-party libraries appears standard and benign. No suspicious code flows or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility script for processing input text, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily performs text manipulation and registers a command handler, both common and safe operations.",
