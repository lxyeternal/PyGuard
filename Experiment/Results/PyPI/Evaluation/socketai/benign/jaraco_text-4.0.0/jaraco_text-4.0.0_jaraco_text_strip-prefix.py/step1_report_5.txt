{
  "purpose": "The code reads input from stdin, strips common prefixes from the input lines, and writes the processed lines to stdout. It also registers the 'strip_prefix' function as an autocommand for the module.",
  "sources": "sys.stdin (reads input data); autocommand and jaraco.text imports (load external modules).",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.writelines (outputs processed data); potential exposure if stdin is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input read from sys.stdin → processed by Stripper.strip_prefix → output via sys.stdout.writelines.",
  "anomalies": "Uses external library 'jaraco.text.Stripper' without clear validation; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; code is straightforward with no obfuscation. The docstring contains a test with io.StringIO, which is typical for testing.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a function 'strip_prefix' that reads input from stdin, strips common prefixes using the external 'Stripper' class, and writes the output to stdout. It registers this function as an autocommand. No user input validation or sanitization is explicitly shown, but given the function's purpose, it processes data stream. No malicious code or suspicious behaviors detected; the usage of external library appears legitimate and not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors present. The docstring test employs 'io.StringIO' which is standard for testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign operation of prefix stripping on input data. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The overall structure and external library usage appear legitimate with no signs of malicious intent.",
