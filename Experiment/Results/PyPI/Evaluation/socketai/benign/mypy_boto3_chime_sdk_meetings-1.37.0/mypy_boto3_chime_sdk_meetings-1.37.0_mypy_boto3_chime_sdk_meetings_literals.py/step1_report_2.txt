  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS SDK service and region identifiers used in boto3 for type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for various AWS service names, region names, and other string-based enums.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows involving untrusted input; the code only defines type aliases.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flow or execution paths; just type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward type alias declarations. The license and copyright notice are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code uses conditional imports for 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines numerous string literal types representing AWS services, regions, and other categories. All definitions are static and serve as type hints for type-checking tools. There is no dynamic execution, user input handling, or data processing present. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are observed. The license and copyright information are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type definition module for AWS SDK literals, with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely enhances type safety in Python projects interacting with AWS services.",
