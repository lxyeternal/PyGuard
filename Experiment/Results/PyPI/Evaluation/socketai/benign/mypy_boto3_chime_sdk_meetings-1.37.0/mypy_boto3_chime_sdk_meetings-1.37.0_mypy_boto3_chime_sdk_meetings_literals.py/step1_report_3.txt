  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS SDK service names, regions, and other enumerations related to the chime-sdk-meetings service, primarily for type annotations and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statement for sys and version check to conditionally import 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. No user input or external data sources present.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code solely consists of static literal definitions with conditional import based on Python version. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it conditionally imports 'Literal' depending on Python version, then defines multiple type aliases and literal types for AWS service names, regions, and other enumerations. The purpose is to provide type hints and documentation. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious data handling. All code appears to be legitimate for its described purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign and standard set of type definitions for AWS SDK literals, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe to use and does not perform any harmful actions.",
