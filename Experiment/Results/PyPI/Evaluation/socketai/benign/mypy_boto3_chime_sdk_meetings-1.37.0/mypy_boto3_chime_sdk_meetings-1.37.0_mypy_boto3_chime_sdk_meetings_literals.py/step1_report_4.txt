{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various literal string types used in AWS SDK for Python (boto3) for the chime-sdk-meetings service and related services.",
  "sources": "Imports sys module, conditional import of Literal based on Python version, and defines multiple Literal types with static string values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only defines constants and type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; the code solely provides static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward type annotations with no dynamic execution or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' for Python >=3.12 or from 'typing_extensions' for earlier versions, then defines multiple literal types for AWS services, regions, and other constants. No input/output operations, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The purpose appears to be purely to provide static type hints for a boto3 SDK wrapper or stub, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static type definition module for AWS SDK literals with no malicious behavior or security risks. It merely provides static constants for type annotations, with no hidden or suspicious code. Overall, the code is benign and intended for type safety.",
