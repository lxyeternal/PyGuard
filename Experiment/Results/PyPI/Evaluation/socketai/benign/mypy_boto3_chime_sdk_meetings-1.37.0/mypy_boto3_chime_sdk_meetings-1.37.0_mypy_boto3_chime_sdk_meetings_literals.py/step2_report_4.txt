  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using `Literal`, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No dynamic code execution, network I/O, or handling of untrusted input is present.\n- The purpose is to provide type safety and documentation support for AWS SDK (boto3) related code, specifically for the chime-sdk-meetings service and various AWS resource and region identifiers.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n- The copyright and documentation strings are benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of code:** The code matches the description—static type alias definitions for AWS literals.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or code flaws are evident. The conditional import for `Literal` is standard practice for compatibility.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which is consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Potential points of concern:\n\n- The only minor point is the inclusion of a copyright notice and documentation string, but these are benign.\n- The code is purely declarative and intended for static analysis.\n\n### Score Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — static type definitions pose no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, standard utility module for static type annotations related to AWS SDK literals.** It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese are consistent with the detailed analyses and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured set of static type definitions for AWS SDK parameters, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It is safe and serves a clear purpose in improving code correctness and developer experience.",
