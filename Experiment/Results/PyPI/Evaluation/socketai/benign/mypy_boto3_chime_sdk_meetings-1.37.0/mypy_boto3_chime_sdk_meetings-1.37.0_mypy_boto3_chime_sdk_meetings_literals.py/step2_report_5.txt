  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literal types for AWS SDK, specifically for chime-sdk-meetings, with hardcoded literals and no external data.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is static, uses conditional import for 'Literal', and only declares type aliases. No dynamic behavior, network I/O, or secrets. The copyright and documentation are benign.\n- **Risk & Malware:** No security risk, malware, or obfuscation. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign, static type definitions with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining literals for AWS services and regions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic code, no data flows, no external inputs. Static declarations for type safety.\n- **Risk & Malware:** No issues detected. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines literals for AWS SDK, with version-aware import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data handling. The code is purely static type hints.\n- **Risk & Malware:** No security concerns. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly identified as benign static type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, with conditional import and static literals.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No runtime code, external data, or suspicious logic. The purpose is to provide type hints.\n- **Risk & Malware:** No issues. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings; safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines literals for chime-sdk-meetings, with documentation and usage example.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic code, external data, or malicious patterns. The code is purely static and for type annotation.\n- **Risk & Malware:** No security risk. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly identified as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code is static, purely for type annotations, with no runtime behavior, external data handling, or secrets.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Zero evidence of malware or obfuscation in all reports.\n- **Security Risk:** None detected; the code is standard for type hinting in Python projects, especially for AWS SDKs.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Note:** Given the nature of the code—static type definitions for AWS SDK literals—these scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, static set of type annotations for AWS SDK parameters, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores as-is: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
