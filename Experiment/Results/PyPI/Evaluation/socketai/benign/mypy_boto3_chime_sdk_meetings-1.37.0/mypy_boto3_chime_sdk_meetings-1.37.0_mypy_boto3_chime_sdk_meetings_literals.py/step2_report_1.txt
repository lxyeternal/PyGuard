  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- The code defines multiple string literal types for AWS SDK parameters, including service names, regions, and configuration options.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, external data inputs, network calls, or code execution.\n- The code contains a copyright notice and documentation, which are benign.\n- The purpose is to provide static type annotations to improve code correctness and developer experience.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Define string literal types for AWS SDK, specifically for chime-sdk-meetings.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as static type definitions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Define string literal types for AWS SDK service and region identifiers.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes static definitions, no data flow or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Define type literals for AWS SDK service names, regions, and other enums related to chime-sdk-meetings.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that the code is straightforward, static, and benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Define literal string types used in AWS SDK for Python (boto3).\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly emphasizes the static nature, no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for chime-sdk-meetings service literals.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes the static, benign nature, no obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type annotations for AWS SDK parameters. No dynamic code, network activity, or external data handling exists.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** No security risks are evident, as the code does not perform any operations beyond type hinting.\n- **Scores Consistency:** The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk; purely static type definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Notes:\n\n- The reports are accurate and aligned with the code's purpose.\n- The code is a benign utility for static type checking, with no indication of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign set of static type annotations for AWS SDK parameters, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports correctly reflect this assessment.",
