  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS SDK parameters, service names, regions, and related enums to enable static type checking and improve developer experience.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals and conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; purely static type alias declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using 'Literal' for various AWS SDK parameters, with a conditional import for compatibility across Python versions. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data sources, network calls, or executable logic. The purpose is to provide type safety and documentation support. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is benign and intended solely for static analysis and developer tooling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type annotations for AWS SDK parameters with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are accurate and appropriate.",
