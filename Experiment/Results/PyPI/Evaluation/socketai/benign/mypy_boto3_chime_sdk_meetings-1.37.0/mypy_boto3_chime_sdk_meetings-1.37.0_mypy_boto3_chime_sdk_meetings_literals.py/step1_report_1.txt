{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for use in AWS SDK type annotations, specifically for the chime-sdk-meetings service and various AWS resources, regions, and configurations.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions are hardcoded within the module; no external data input is involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network, file I/O, or environment variable usage are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only establishes type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are present. The code primarily consists of static type annotations and conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports the 'Literal' type from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility. It then defines multiple string literal types for various AWS-related parameters, including service names, regions, and configuration options. These definitions are static and intended for type hinting, with no dynamic or malicious behavior evident. There are no code execution, network operations, or data handling beyond type annotations. The only potential concern is the inclusion of a copyright notice and documentation string, which are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The module provides static type definitions for AWS SDK parameters with no indication of malicious behavior. It appears to be a standard, benign type annotation utility intended to improve code correctness and developer experience.",
