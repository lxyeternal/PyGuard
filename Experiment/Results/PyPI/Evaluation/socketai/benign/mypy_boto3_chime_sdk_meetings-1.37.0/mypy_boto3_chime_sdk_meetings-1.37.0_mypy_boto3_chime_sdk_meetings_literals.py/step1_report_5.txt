  "purpose": "Type annotations for chime-sdk-meetings service literal definitions used in type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions, definitions of Literal types, module docstring with licensing and usage info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications detected.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines constants and type aliases without runtime data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard type annotation definitions. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code segments. The docstring includes a copyright statement and usage example.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines multiple Literal types representing constants for the AWS chime-sdk-meetings service. It includes a comprehensive list of string literals for various configuration options and resource identifiers. No dynamic execution, external data sources, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is purely declarative, focusing on type annotations for static analysis and documentation purposes. The presence of a copyright notice and detailed constants suggest legitimate use, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of type alias definitions for AWS SDK literals, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves as a static typing aid for other modules.",
