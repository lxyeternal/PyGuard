  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code to identify any discrepancies, potential issues, or inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code defines string literal types for AWS SDK, specifically for chime-sdk-meetings and other resources. No external data sources involved.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurately states that the code is static, benign, and intended for type hinting. No malicious behavior or anomalies are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The report's conclusion aligns with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the definitions of AWS service names, regions, and enums as literals.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is static, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns. The report accurately reflects the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the purpose of defining literals for AWS SDK, with conditional import logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is benign, static, and intended for type annotations, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The report is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately notes the purpose of defining literals and the conditional import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as static, benign, and purely for type hints.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns. The report aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code defines literals for the chime-sdk-meetings service, with documentation and usage examples.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately notes the absence of dynamic behavior, external data, or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — suitable.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The report's conclusions are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No issues, errors, or malicious behavior are evident in the code or reports.\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports assign malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n- **Consistency:** The reports are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Also remains at 0, as there's no security concern.\n- **Overall Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:** Based on the analysis, I would assign:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Security Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the understanding that the code is purely static type annotations intended to improve developer experience and code correctness, with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** All reports are accurate, and the code is safe and benign. No changes to the scoring or analysis are necessary.",
