  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, potential issues, or signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code is for type annotations and client interface for Amazon Chime SDK Meetings.  \n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is purely interface definitions.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Confirms the code is standard, with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **Reasonable.**  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type annotations and SDK interface.  \n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No dynamic code, network calls, or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK interface, no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **Reasonable.**  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, with detailed method signatures.  \n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Looks like a typical type stub, with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — **Slightly above zero risk, but justified given the static nature.**  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same consistent pattern.  \n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or code behaviors.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK interface, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **Reasonable.**  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, standard SDK interface with method signatures.  \n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No dynamic or malicious code detected.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of sabotage or malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **Reasonable.**  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected, scores are 0 as expected.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in one report (0.1), justified by the nature of the code being static interface definitions.  \n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No signs of malicious payloads or behaviors.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation patterns.  \n- **Security Risk:** Very low, as this is a static SDK interface with no runtime logic or data handling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, well-structured Python client interface for AWS SDK, serving as type annotations and method signatures. No malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks are evident. The slight risk score of 0.1 in one report is reasonable given the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware and obfuscation scores at 0.  \n- Keep the overall security risk minimal.  \n- No further action needed.",
