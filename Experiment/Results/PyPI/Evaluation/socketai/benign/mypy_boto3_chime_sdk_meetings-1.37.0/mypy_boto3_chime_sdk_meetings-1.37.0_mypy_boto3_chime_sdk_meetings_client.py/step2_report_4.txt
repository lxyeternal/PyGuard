  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states it's a type annotation and client interface for Amazon Chime SDK Meetings, based on standard imports and method signatures.  \n- **Flows & Anomalies:** Inputs flow into API calls via unpacked type definitions; no suspicious code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured Python interface with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing type annotations and SDK interface.  \n- **Flows & Anomalies:** Minimal data flow, no suspicious code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Again, a standard SDK interface with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—type annotations for SDK client.  \n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No external data leaks or malicious patterns.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just static interface definitions.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (slightly above zero).  \n- **Justification for risk score:** Given it's purely a stub/interface with no runtime logic, the small non-zero risk seems unwarranted.  \n**Verdict:** The risk score should be 0, not 0.1, as there's no active code or vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others—type annotations, method signatures.  \n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious code or data flow.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK interface, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above—type annotations and method signatures.  \n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No malicious patterns.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK stub, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** None of the code appears obfuscated or intentionally hidden.  \n- **Risk score:** For the static interface code, the risk should be minimal, ideally 0, as there's no active logic, network activity, or data handling that could pose a security threat.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Adjust Report 3's risk score from 0.1 to 0.0** to reflect the absence of any real security concern.  \n- **Overall malware and obfuscated scores:** remain at 0 across all reports.\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface with no malicious or obfuscated components. The risk is negligible, and the current scores are appropriate except for the minor adjustment in Report 3.",
