  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states it's a type annotation and client interface for AWS Chime SDK Meetings, with standard imports and method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The code primarily unpacks type definitions into method parameters; no active data flow or external data processing is evident.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is purely interface definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured SDK stub with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code as a type stub for boto3 client with exception handling.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or external communication.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still notes the code as a type stub with no malicious intent.\n- Highlights extensive use of type annotations and unpacking, typical for SDK stubs.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable given the minimal uncertainty, but overall very low risk.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar analysis: standard SDK interface, no suspicious patterns.\n- No dynamic code, external calls, or malicious payloads.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also confirms the code as a straightforward type stub with no malicious behavior.\n- Emphasizes that it's primarily for static analysis and type safety.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify this as a static SDK interface/stub, not runtime logic.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** All are appropriately low, with some minor uncertainty in report 3, but still negligible.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or near-zero; the code is purely interface/stub code with no security implications.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided scores.** The code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code, and the risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code as a static type stub for AWS SDK interactions.",
