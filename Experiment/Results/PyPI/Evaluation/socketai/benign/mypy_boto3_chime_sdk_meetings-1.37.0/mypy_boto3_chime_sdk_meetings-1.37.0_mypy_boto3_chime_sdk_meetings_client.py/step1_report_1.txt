  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for Amazon Chime SDK Meetings, providing methods to interact with the service.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, typing, botocore, and local type definitions. Method definitions for client operations, including parameters and return types.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters (mostly **kwargs unpacked from type definitions), return statements (e.g., generate_presigned_url), and properties (exceptions).",
  "flows": "Inputs from method parameters flow into API calls via unpacked type definitions; generate_presigned_url takes Params, HttpMethod, and other args; exceptions and properties access internal error types.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data exfiltration evident. Use of type annotations and method signatures appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client interface class for the AWS Chime SDK Meetings service, with proper type annotations, exception handling, and method signatures. It imports standard modules, including conditional imports for compatibility, and references local type definitions. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors, such as network communications, file modifications, or credential leaks, are present. The generate_presigned_url method aligns with expected AWS SDK practices, and all other methods are standard wrappers with appropriate type hints. The class and its methods are purely interface definitions without executable logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Python client interface for AWS Chime SDK Meetings with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is purely for type annotations and method signatures, with no malicious payloads or suspicious behaviors detected.",
