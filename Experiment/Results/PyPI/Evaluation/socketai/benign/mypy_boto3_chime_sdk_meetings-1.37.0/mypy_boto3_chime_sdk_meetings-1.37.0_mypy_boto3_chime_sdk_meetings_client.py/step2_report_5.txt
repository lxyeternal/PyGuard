  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes a type annotation and client interface for Amazon Chime SDK Meetings, with standard imports and method signatures.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No unusual code patterns, no dynamic execution, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured interface with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent and justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, describing a boto3 client interface with exception handling.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clearly a standard SDK interface, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, with emphasis on type annotations.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or malicious code, just type stubs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard static interface, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the slight securityRisk score might be due to the unpacking of **kwargs, but given the static nature, this is minimal and acceptable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with previous, standard SDK interface.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Serves as a type-safe wrapper, no security concerns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, focusing on type annotations.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious code or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clearly a static interface, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports describe static interface code with no executable logic or malicious payloads.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- **Scores:** All are consistent with the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated scores:** All are zero, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero in one report (0.1), but justified due to unpacking **kwargs, which is standard in SDK stub files.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface with no malicious behavior.\n- The risk scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No need to adjust scores or raise concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — minimal to none, as it is just type annotations and interface definitions.\n\n**Overall, the code is safe and intended solely for static type checking and API interfacing.**",
