  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for AWS Chime SDK Meetings, serving as static SDK stubs for type safety and API structure.",
  "sources": "Import statements for type definitions, method signatures unpacking request types, and static property/method declarations.",
  "sinks": "No active data sinks; the code only unpacks type definitions into method parameters without executing logic or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Method calls unpack request type definitions; no runtime data flow or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured SDK interface with comprehensive type annotations. It contains no executable logic, network calls, or data leaks. The unpacking of request types is standard for SDK stub files. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation are present. The minimal risk score (0.1 in one report) is justified by the static nature of the code. All reports correctly identify this as a non-malicious, static interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe SDK stub for boto3, with no malicious or obfuscated components. The low security risk and malware scores are appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
