  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for interacting with Amazon Chime SDK Meetings service via boto3, including method signatures and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, botocore, and custom type definitions; method signatures for API calls; exception class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data flow to external systems or sensitive operations observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; primarily type annotations and method signatures without actual data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code is primarily boilerplate for type annotations and client interface.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for a boto3 client wrapper for the Chime SDK Meetings service. It imports necessary modules, defines exception types, and outlines method signatures matching the boto3 API. There are no dynamic code executions, data manipulations, or network operations within this fragment. The presence of copyright info and documentation links is standard. The code appears to be generated or structured for static type checking and does not include malicious behaviors or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type-annotated interface for the boto3 Chime SDK Meetings client, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It serves as a type stub for static analysis and client method signatures.",
