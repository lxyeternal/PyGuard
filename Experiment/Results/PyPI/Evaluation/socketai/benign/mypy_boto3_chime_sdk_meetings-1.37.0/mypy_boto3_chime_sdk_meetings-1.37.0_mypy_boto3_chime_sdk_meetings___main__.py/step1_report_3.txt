  "purpose": "Provides CLI commands to display package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 ChimeSDKMeetings.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs package info and version to stdout).",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs data to standard output).",
  "flows": "Command-line input (checking '--version') leads to output of version or package info via sys.stdout.write.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No suspicious dynamic code, obfuscation, or external network activity. The code is straightforward, with simple input/output logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines functions to print static package info and version, and checks command-line arguments for '--version'. The main function manages output based on user input. No data from external sources, no sensitive information, and no dangerous behavior detected. No use of unsafe functions or suspicious patterns. The code is minimal, focused on information display, and adheres to good practices. The absence of external network calls, obfuscated code, or data manipulation suggests it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI interface for displaying package info and version number, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs no harmful actions and is safe for use.",
