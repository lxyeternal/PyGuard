  "purpose": "The code serves as a command-line interface entrypoint for a package, providing version and package info output.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Writes to stdout using sys.stdout.write",
  "flows": "User inputs '--version' to trigger print_version, otherwise default is print_info",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code functions as straightforward CLI utility with no suspicious or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and defines functions to output package info and version to stdout. The main() function checks command-line arguments for '--version' and calls appropriate functions. There are no hardcoded credentials, external network connections, or data leaks. No obfuscated or malicious code is present. The code is simple and adheres to standard CLI patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It only outputs static information based on user input.",
