  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Functionality Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info and version.\n   - It uses `sys.argv` to detect if `--version` is passed.\n   - It outputs static strings via `sys.stdout.write`.\n   - No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Logical & Security Flaws:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no vulnerabilities, malware, or malicious intent.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.\n   - The logic is sound and consistent across reports.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, no obfuscation.\n   - **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Security risk score (0):** Correct, no vulnerabilities or risks.\n   \n   Since all reports agree on these points, the scores seem appropriate.\n\n4. **Potential Assumptions & Claims:**\n   - All reports state that the code is benign and straightforward.\n   - No claims are based on unfounded assumptions; they are consistent with the code.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment & Final Scores:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying static information.\n   - No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n   - The confidence in these assessments is high (1).\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, straightforward CLI script with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n- The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are justified and appropriate.",
