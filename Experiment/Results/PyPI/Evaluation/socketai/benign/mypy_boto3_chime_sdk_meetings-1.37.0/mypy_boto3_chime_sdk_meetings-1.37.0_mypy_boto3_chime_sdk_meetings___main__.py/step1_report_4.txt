  "purpose": "Provide CLI interface to display package information and version.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Writes output to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument; if present, calls print_version(), otherwise calls print_info().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward and standard for CLI scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys to handle command-line inputs and outputs. It defines two functions for printing package info and version, both of which write to stdout. The main() function determines whether to print version info based on command-line arguments. No external network calls, no data leakage, or code execution based on untrusted input are present. The code appears to be a simple, benign CLI utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script designed to display package information and version. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are evident.",
