{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI utility to display static package information and version details for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via sys.argv to detect '--version'.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to stdout using sys.stdout.write; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, it calls print_version() which outputs version info; otherwise, it calls print_info() to output package details.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static information. It only processes command-line arguments to determine which static info to display. There are no external data sources, no user input beyond argument detection, and no dynamic or malicious code. The code is clear, simple, and follows standard practices. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present. The logic is correct, and the code's behavior is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions solely to display package info and version details. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
