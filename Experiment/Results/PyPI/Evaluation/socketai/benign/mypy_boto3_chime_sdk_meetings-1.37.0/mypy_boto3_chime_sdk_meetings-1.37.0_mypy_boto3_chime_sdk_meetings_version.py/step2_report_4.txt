  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code, or data flows are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code is standard for Python package versioning.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and logical assessments:\n\n**Presence of issues in code:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static string to `__version__`.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are present; the code is benign.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports. They uniformly recognize the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n- The third report has a slightly lower confidence (0.9), but given the simplicity, this is acceptable.\n- No report suggests any suspicious behavior that would warrant higher risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n### Any assumptions or claims to challenge?\n- The reports are accurate; the code is just a version string assignment.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are justified here.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard version declaration with no vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
