  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll reports describe a very simple, static assignment of a version string to `__version__` with accompanying copyright comments. There are no data flows, external inputs, dynamic code, or suspicious behaviors. The scores assigned—malware, obfuscated, security risk—are all zero or very low, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code is a straightforward version string assignment.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data flow.\n- The code is standard in Python packaging.\n\n### Issues in the Reports:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- No errors, flaws, or reasoning mistakes are apparent.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are evident.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The code is static and does not process external data, so no risks are introduced.\n- The copyright notice does not influence security assessments.\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is purely metadata with no executable logic, data flow, or external interactions. It poses no security risk and is not obfuscated or malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, standard, and safe. The scores assigned are appropriate. No changes needed.",
