  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a simple Python module that assigns a static string `\"1.37.0\"` to the variable `__version__`.\n- It contains only a comment block with copyright info.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward version declaration.\n- No suspicious behavior, data flows, or external interactions are present.\n- No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, serving only as a metadata holder for versioning.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the scores:\n\n| Report | malware | obfuscated | risk | reasoning |\n|---------|-----------|--------------|-------|------------|\n| 1       | 0         | 0            | 0     | No malicious behavior, simple assignment. |\n| 2       | 0         | 0            | 0     | Same reasoning; standard version declaration. |\n| 3       | 0         | 0            | 0     | No external data, no suspicious code. |\n| 4       | 0         | 0            | 0     | No dynamic code, no security concerns. |\n| 5       | 0         | 0            | 0     | Standard version assignment, no risks. |\n\nAll scores seem reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** Should be 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The code is a standard version declaration.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate. The code is benign, and no adjustments are necessary.",
