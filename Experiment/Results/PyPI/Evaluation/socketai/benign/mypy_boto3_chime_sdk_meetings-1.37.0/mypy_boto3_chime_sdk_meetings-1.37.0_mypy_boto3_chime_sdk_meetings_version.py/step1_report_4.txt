  "purpose": "Define and store the version number of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The code assigns a string value to the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to untrusted sources; no external input processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths present in the code.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a version string for the package and includes a copyright notice. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious logic. The code is standard for Python packages to specify version info and does not contain any malicious patterns or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as metadata for the package version. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
