  "anomalies": "None; code is a straightforward static assignment with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a fixed string '1.37.0' to __version__, serving as package metadata. It contains no input handling, dynamic code, or external interactions. The code is simple, clear, and follows standard Python packaging practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The copyright comment does not impact security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely metadata, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard version declaration in Python packages.",
