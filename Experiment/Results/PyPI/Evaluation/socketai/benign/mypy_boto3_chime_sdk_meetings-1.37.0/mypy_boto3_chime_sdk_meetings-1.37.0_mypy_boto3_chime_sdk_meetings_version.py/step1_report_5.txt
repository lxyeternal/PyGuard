  "purpose": "Defines the version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable with a string literal.",
  "targets": "The __version__ variable is likely used elsewhere in the package for version tracking.",
  "flows": "The version string is assigned directly from a hardcoded string; no data flow or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no dynamic code, no secrets, and no suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a static string '1.37.0' to the __version__ variable. It contains a copyright statement but no executable logic. There are no input sources, no sinks, and no data flows that could lead to security issues. The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as metadata for the package. The code is benign.",
