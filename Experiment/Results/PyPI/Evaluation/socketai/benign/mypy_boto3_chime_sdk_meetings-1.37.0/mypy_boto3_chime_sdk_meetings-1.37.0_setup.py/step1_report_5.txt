  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-chime-sdk-meetings package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; no other data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A - the script primarily reads local files and calls setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The script performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pathlib and setuptools, reads a local README.md file for description, and calls setup() with fixed metadata. No dynamic code execution, no external data input, and no network activity. All data used is static or derived locally. No obfuscated code, no use of eval, exec, or similar functions. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive information. The dependencies are version-restricted but benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup script for packaging. It does not contain malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It performs expected package setup operations without any suspicious activities.",
