  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-chime-sdk-meetings package, used to configure package metadata and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup from setuptools, and static package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; all data is statically defined or from safe sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; static configuration data flows into the setup function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script without dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path from pathlib and setup from setuptools to configure package installation. It reads the README.md for the long description, which is a typical practice. No user inputs, environment variables, or external data are processed at runtime. The data used (package metadata) is static and hardcoded. No dynamic execution, network calls, or file writes beyond reading the README file. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malware activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard, benign configuration file for Python package distribution. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
