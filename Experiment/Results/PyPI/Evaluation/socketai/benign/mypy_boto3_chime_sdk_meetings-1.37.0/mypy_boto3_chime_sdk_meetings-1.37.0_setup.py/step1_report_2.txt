{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the Python package 'mypy-boto3-chime-sdk-meetings' for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads input parameters for setup() such as package name, version, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup configuration parameters are hardcoded and do not process external inputs.",
  "flows": "N/A, no untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns present. The code follows standard setup script practices, with no hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a README file for description, and invokes setuptools.setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All data appears static, controlled, and typical for a setup script. No external inputs, user inputs, or dynamic data are processed. No suspicious code patterns or behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a legitimate package setup file.",
