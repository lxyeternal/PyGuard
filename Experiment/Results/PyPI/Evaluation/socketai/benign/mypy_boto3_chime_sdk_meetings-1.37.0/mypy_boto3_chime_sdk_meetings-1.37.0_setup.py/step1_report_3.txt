  "purpose": "The script is for setting up a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-chime-sdk-meetings', including metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description, static string literals for package metadata and configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no network or system calls are made.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the script solely defines package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is a standard setup script with no obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'Path' from pathlib to read a local README.md file for the long description. It uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and URLs. All content is static and intended for package configuration. There are no dynamic executions, input processing, or network interactions. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security concerns. It is a standard, safe configuration for distributing a Python package.",
