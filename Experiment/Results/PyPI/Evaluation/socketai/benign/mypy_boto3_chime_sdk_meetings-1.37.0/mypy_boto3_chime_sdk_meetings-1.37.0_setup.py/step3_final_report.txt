{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a library, with static metadata and no dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from local file read and hardcoded parameters into setup(), with no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, readable, and follows standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path and setup, reads a local README.md file, and calls setup() with static, hardcoded package information. There are no dynamic code executions, environment variable manipulations, network calls, or obfuscation techniques. The code is typical for a Python package setup and contains no secrets, credentials, or malicious constructs. All data is static and safe, and the structure is conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup.py script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are consistent with the analysis.",
