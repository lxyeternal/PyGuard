  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-chime-sdk-meetings package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data outputs or network connections.",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md file as input for long_description, then passing static configuration data to setup(). No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The script uses standard setup configuration with no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python setup script importing pathlib and setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads a static README.md file for the long_description, which is standard practice. All package information, URLs, and dependencies are hardcoded and static, with no external inputs or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The script conforms to typical setup.py structure without obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal, benign setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
