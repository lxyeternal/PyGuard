  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report correctly identifies that the script is a standard setup.py with static data, no dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data sinks, no anomalies, no obfuscation, no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard setup script with static configuration.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no dynamic code, no external inputs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical setup.py with static data, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no obfuscation, no external data processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, reads local README.md, no dynamic or external inputs.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others; standard setup.py with static data.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no external data, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that the script is a benign, standard package setup.\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which is correct given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, appropriate for a static, well-understood setup script.\n\n### Final justification:\n\nThe code is a typical setup.py configuration script with no dynamic code execution, no network calls, no user inputs, no obfuscation, and no malicious activities. The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent, and the scores are justified. No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe setup script is benign, standard, and free from security issues. The provided reports correctly identify this, and the scoring aligns with the analysis.",
