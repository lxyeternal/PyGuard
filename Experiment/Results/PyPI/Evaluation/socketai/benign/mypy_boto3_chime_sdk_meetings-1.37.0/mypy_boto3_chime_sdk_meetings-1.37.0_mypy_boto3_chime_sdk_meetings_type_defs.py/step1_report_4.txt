{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structure annotations for the chime-sdk-meetings service, used to facilitate type checking and validation in Python code interacting with AWS Chime SDK Meetings API.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type definitions, constants, and imports from standard and third-party libraries. It also defines various TypedDict classes and constants for API data structures.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data processing are present. The code primarily defines data schemas and type annotations. No data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The code does not perform data flow operations; it only declares data types and constants used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. It uses version-dependent imports and standard Python typing features. No obfuscated or malicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type definitions for the AWS Chime SDK meetings API, using TypedDict and type annotations to specify the structure of request and response objects. It uses standard Python typing practices, with conditional imports based on Python version. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or network operations are present. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling routines. The code appears to be a typical, well-structured set of type definitions intended for type safety and clarity in larger codebases.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely declarative, defining data structures for type safety in SDK interactions. No malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks are evident. It is safe for use as part of a type-annotated Python SDK or client library.",
