  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a collection of static type definitions using TypedDict, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and documentation strings.\n   - No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - The code appears to be auto-generated or manually maintained SDK type annotations for the AWS Chime SDK Meetings service.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural and for type checking.\n   - The only minor point is the mention of a future copyright date (2025) in the first report, which is unusual but not malicious or problematic.\n   - No report claims or implies any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the analysis; the code is purely static type annotations.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No issues or suspicious behaviors justify higher scores.\n   - The reports' scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n   - No malicious activity, code injection, or obfuscated malicious code detected.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports base their analysis on observable code characteristics, not assumptions.\n   - The only unusual aspect is the future copyright date, which is not suspicious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all are zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n   - Confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified; the code is purely structural.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The only minor anomaly is the future date in the copyright, which might be a placeholder or typo, but it does not impact security.\n- The code is standard, well-structured, and typical for SDK type definitions.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **The code is safe, non-malicious, and purely for static type checking.**\n- **Scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.**\n- **The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.**\n\nIf I were to assign my own scores based on this review:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments.",
