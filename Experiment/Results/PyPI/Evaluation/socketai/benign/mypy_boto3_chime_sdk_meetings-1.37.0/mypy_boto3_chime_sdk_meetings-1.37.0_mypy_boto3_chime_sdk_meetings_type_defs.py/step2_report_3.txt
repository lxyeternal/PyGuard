  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details provided and applying our security expertise.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** The report states that the code defines type annotations for the chime-sdk-meetings service, mainly data models for API requests/responses. It mentions no data processing, external interactions, or dynamic code execution.\n\n- **Findings:** The code is purely static type definitions, with no signs of malicious behavior. The only notable aspect is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future and unusual but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, security risk is 0. These are appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static type definitions, constants, and imports. No dynamic behavior or data handling.\n\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward type annotations, with standard imports and no external data sources.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, security risk is 0. Correct.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign and purely structural.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Again, type definitions for the SDK, with static data structures and constants. The only unusual element is the copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future.\n\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no data flow issues. The future date is suspicious but not malicious; it might be a placeholder or a typo.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, obfuscated is 0, security risk is 0. This is appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected. The future date is benign but worth noting.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar to others—static type definitions, no runtime code, no data processing.\n\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious patterns, standard Python typing practices.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0. Appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, well-structured type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Static data structure definitions for the SDK, with version-aware imports and no dynamic code.\n\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, no external data handling.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard SDK type definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The code is purely static type annotations.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** None of the reports detect obfuscation; the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of runtime code, data handling, or external interactions, a risk score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The only unusual aspect across reports is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future. This is likely a placeholder or a typo, not malicious.\n\n- The code appears to be auto-generated or maintained as part of an SDK, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n**Risk score:** 0.0\n\nThe code is safe, standard, and purely for static type checking purposes. No further action needed.",
