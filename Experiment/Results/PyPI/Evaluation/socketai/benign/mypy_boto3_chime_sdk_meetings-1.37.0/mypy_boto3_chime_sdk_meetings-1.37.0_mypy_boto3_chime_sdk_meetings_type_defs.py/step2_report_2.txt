  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the provided code to identify any potential security issues, anomalies, or inconsistencies.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of static type definitions using Python's `TypedDict` and related constructs.\n- It includes conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- The code has no runtime logic, data processing, network calls, or external data handling.\n- The presence of a copyright year 2025 is unusual but not malicious; it may be a placeholder or typo.\n- The documentation link and structure suggest this is an SDK type definition module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **No runtime or data flow issues**: The code is purely static type annotations.\n- **No signs of malware or malicious behavior**: No code executes, no external data is processed.\n- **No obfuscation or suspicious patterns**: The code is straightforward, with standard Python typing.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose**: Describes the code as type definitions for the chime-sdk-meetings service.\n- **Findings**: No anomalies, no anomalies or unusual code behavior. The code is well-structured.\n- **Conclusion**: No malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score**: 0 — accurate.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — accurate.\n- **Risk score**: 0 — appropriate.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose**: Similar to Report 1, confirming static type definitions.\n- **Findings**: No untrusted data sources or sinks, no dynamic code.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe, standard type annotations.\n- **Malware score**: 0 — accurate.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — accurate.\n- **Risk score**: 0 — appropriate.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose**: Same as above, describing type annotations.\n- **Findings**: The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year (2025).\n- **Analysis**: This is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n- **Conclusion**: No malicious intent or security issues.\n- **Malware score**: 0 — accurate.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — accurate.\n- **Risk score**: 0 — appropriate.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose**: Similar description of type definitions.\n- **Findings**: No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis**: Standard static type definitions, version-aware imports.\n- **Conclusion**: Benign, safe code.\n- **Malware score**: 0 — accurate.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — accurate.\n- **Risk score**: 0 — appropriate.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose**: Defines type annotations for SDK.\n- **Findings**: No dynamic logic, no external data handling, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis**: Well-structured, standard SDK type definitions.\n- **Conclusion**: No malicious activity.\n- **Malware score**: 0 — accurate.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — accurate.\n- **Risk score**: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score**: All reports correctly assign 0; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score**: All reports correctly assign 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score**: All are 0, which is appropriate given the static nature and purpose of the code.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a placeholder or typo but not malicious.\n- The code is purely structural, with no runtime or external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for the AWS Chime SDK Meetings service. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
