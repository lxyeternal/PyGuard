  "purpose": "Type definitions for the chime-sdk-meetings service, used for typing in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys, builtins, collections.abc, typing_extensions, and internal type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None present; no functions, external data handling, or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed; the code contains only type definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code includes a copyright statement with a future date, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type definitions using TypedDict, importing type annotations, and conditional imports based on Python version. There are no functions, network operations, data processing, or external calls that could indicate malicious behavior. The presence of a future copyright date (2025) appears suspicious but is not inherently malicious; it might be a placeholder or a typo. Overall, the code is a standard type definition module with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign set of type annotations for the chime-sdk-meetings service. No malicious intent or security issues are detected. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright date, which does not impact security.",
