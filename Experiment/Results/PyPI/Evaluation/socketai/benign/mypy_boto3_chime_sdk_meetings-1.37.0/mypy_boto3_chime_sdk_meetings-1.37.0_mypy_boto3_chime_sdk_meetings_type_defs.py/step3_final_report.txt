  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the AWS Chime SDK Meetings service, primarily static type hints for API request and response models.",
  "sources": "Static type definitions using TypedDict, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, documentation strings, and constants.",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains no runtime data processing, external data input, or network interactions.",
  "flows": "None; the code is purely static type annotations with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the copyright year '2025', which is in the future and likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions for the SDK, with conditional imports for compatibility. No dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions are present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The future copyright year is suspicious but not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0) are consistent with the code's static, structural nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of type annotations for the AWS Chime SDK Meetings service, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright date, which does not impact security or functionality.",
