  "purpose": "Type definitions for the chime-sdk-meetings service, used for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from system modules (sys, builtins, collections.abc, typing_extensions), local literals module, and type annotations within class and variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code primarily defines static data structures and constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow or execution paths; this code only contains type definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code appears to be straightforward type annotations and data structure definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type definitions for a Python SDK, including TypedDict structures, constants, and conditional imports based on Python version. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling from untrusted sources is present. All imported modules and data structures are standard or documentation-related. The presence of a copyright statement and documentation link indicates this is an official or open-source SDK code segment. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of type annotations and data structures for the chime-sdk-meetings service. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and purely for static type checking and documentation purposes.",
