  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for potential issues, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is purely static type definitions for the AWS Chime SDK Meetings service.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code uses standard Python typing practices, with conditional imports for compatibility.\n- The only unusual aspect is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to the current date (October 2023). This is likely a placeholder or a typo, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Analysis:\n\n#### 1. **Malware Score:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- No signs of backdoors, obfuscated payloads, or malicious behavior.\n\n#### 2. **Obfuscated Score:**\n- All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, indicating the code is straightforward and readable.\n- No obfuscation techniques or suspicious code patterns are present.\n\n#### 3. **Security Risk Score:**\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n#### 4. **Potential Issues:**\n- The only noteworthy anomaly is the copyright date \"2025,\" which is in the future. While unusual, it does not impact security or indicate malicious intent.\n- The code is purely type annotations and data structure definitions, with no runtime logic.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justification:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, standard type definitions.\n- **Risk:** 0 — No security vulnerabilities or risky patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The current scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Aspect | Estimated Score | Justification |\n|---------|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware | 0 | No malicious behavior detected. |\n| Obfuscated | 0 | Code is straightforward and well-structured. |\n| Risk | 0 | No security vulnerabilities or risky patterns. |\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, safe set of type definitions with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.**",
