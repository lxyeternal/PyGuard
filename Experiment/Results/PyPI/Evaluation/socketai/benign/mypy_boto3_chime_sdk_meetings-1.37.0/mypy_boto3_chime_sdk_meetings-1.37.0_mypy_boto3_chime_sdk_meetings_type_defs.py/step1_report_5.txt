{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for the Amazon Chime SDK Meetings service in Python, facilitating type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, builtins, collections.abc, typing_extensions, and local literals module; type definitions and class declarations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly defines data structures without executing external commands or handling untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable—this code does not process untrusted input or data flows; it only defines types and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code includes standard type definitions, conditional imports based on Python version, and clear annotations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily static type definitions for the Chime SDK meetings module, with careful version-aware imports and structured TypedDict classes. There are no functions executing logic, no data input/output handling, and no code that could be malicious. The initial docstring is a placeholder with a link and a copyright notice, which is standard. All imported modules and literals are typical for type annotations. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK. It does not contain any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is safe for use and distribution as part of an SDK package.",
