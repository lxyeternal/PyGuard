  "purpose": "Type definitions for the chime-sdk-meetings service, providing structured data models for API requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Constant imports, sys.version_info checks for conditional imports, and class/typed dict definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code mainly consists of type annotations and data structure definitions with no data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows, as this is purely type definitions. No source-to-sink data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior observed. The code adheres to standard Python typing conventions and version compatibility checks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and conditionally imports typing constructs based on Python version. It defines multiple TypedDict classes for API request/response schemas. No external input handling, dynamic execution, or code injection is present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic identified. The code appears to be a well-structured, auto-generated or manually maintained type definition module for SDK purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of type annotations for the AWS Chime SDK Meeting service, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is purely structural and for type checking, with no runtime execution or external data handling.",
