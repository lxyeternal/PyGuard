{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface and documentation for the chime-sdk-meetings service, mainly importing a client class.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module (.client), and documentation/comments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily defines imports and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The copyright date appears in the future (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a client class for AWS Chime SDK Meetings, sets an alias, and defines exports. The documentation links and comments are benign. The only notable aspect is the future copyright date, which might be a typo or placeholder, but not indicative of malicious intent. There are no code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behaviors. No external data is read or written, and no complex logic or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward interface module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily serves as a wrapper for an imported client class with documentation. The future-dated copyright may warrant a review but does not impact security.",
