{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the chime-sdk-meetings service, including documentation and client setup.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.client' to instantiate the client class.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "Imports instantiate a client object, but there is no dynamic or untrusted input flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is mostly boilerplate for module export.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports a client class from a local module, assigns it to a variable, and exposes it via __all__. It includes documentation and licensing info. No input reading, data processing, or external data flow is present. The code appears to be a standard module wrapper with no malicious or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, serves as an interface module, and contains no malicious behavior or security issues. It does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
