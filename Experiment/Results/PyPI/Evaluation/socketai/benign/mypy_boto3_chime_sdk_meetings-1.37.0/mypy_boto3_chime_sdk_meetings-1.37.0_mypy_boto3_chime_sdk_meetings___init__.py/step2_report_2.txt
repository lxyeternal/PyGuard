  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple module that imports a client class and exposes it.\n- No untrusted data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The only noted anomaly is the future copyright date (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk scores:** Very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n- The high confidence (1 or 0.9) is justified, as the code is straightforward and unambiguous.\n- The minimal security risk (0 or 0.1) aligns with the lack of any malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The only questionable aspect is the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, it doesn't impact security.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent exists; thus, the malware score remains at 0.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to the future date anomaly, which is not security-critical)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is a benign interface module with no security issues. The only minor note is the future copyright date, which could be corrected but doesn't affect security.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Slightly increase the security risk score to 0.1 or 0.2 to reflect the date anomaly, but this is minor.\n- Overall, the security posture is very low risk.",
