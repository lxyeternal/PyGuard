{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the chime-sdk-meetings service by importing and exporting the client class.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module (.client import ChimeSDKMeetingsClient). No external data sources or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no untrusted data processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Import of the client class, assignment to a variable, and export via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports a client class and exposes it. It contains only documentation, import statements, and variable assignments. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The only anomaly is the future copyright date, which does not impact security. The code lacks any malicious or suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, simple interface module with no security risks or malicious intent. The minor anomaly of the future copyright date does not affect security. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the code content.",
