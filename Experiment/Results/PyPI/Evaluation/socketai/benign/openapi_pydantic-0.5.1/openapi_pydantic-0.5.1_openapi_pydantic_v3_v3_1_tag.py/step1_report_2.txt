  "purpose": "Define a Pydantic data model for tagging metadata in an API, including optional external documentation.",
  "sources": "Input data: not explicitly read in this code; external documentation class import; class fields set via class definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are explicitly present; configuration settings are static.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; class definition and configuration setup are static and do not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The use of version-dependent config is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward Pydantic model with optional fields and conditional configuration based on Pydantic version. It imports external modules and sets model configuration. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data manipulations involving untrusted input. The configuration options are static and typical for Pydantic models. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured model definition for API tagging metadata. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
