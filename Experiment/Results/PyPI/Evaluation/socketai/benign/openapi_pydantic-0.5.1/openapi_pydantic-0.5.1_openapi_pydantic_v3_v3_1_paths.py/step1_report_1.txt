  "purpose": "Define a type alias 'Paths' as a dictionary mapping string path patterns to PathItem objects, representing API endpoint paths with descriptive comments.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code is defining a type alias and documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines data structures and comments.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. Comments are standard for API documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing.Dict, defines a type alias Paths as Dict[str, PathItem], and includes detailed docstrings explaining the purpose of the Paths dictionary and patterned fields. No dynamic execution, user input handling, or security-sensitive operations are present. There is no obfuscation or malicious pattern; the code is standard type annotation and documentation for API path definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a simple, benign type alias definition with descriptive comments. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior risk.",
