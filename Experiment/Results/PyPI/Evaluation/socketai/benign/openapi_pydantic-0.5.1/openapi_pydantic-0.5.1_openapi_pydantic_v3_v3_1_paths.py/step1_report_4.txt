{
  "purpose": "Defines type alias 'Paths' for a dictionary mapping string paths to PathItem objects, with documentation explaining URL construction and path templating.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code solely defines types and comments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward type alias definition with descriptive comments. It imports 'Dict' from 'typing' and imports 'PathItem' from a local module. No runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling exists. The comments are documentation-only, providing context about URL paths and templating. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign type alias definition with accompanying documentation. It does not perform any data processing or contain any malicious or suspicious code. The overall security risk is negligible.",
