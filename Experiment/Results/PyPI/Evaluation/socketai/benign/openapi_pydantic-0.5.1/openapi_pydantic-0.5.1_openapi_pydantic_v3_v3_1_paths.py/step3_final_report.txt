{
  "purpose": "Defines a type alias 'Paths' as a dictionary mapping string paths to PathItem objects, serving as a schema for API endpoint paths with descriptive documentation.",
  "sources": "No data sources; static type alias and documentation only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static definitions without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-documented, and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static type alias with extensive descriptive comments for API path patterns. It imports standard typing modules and a local class, with no executable or dynamic code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are present. The documentation clarifies URL construction and templating, serving as API schema documentation. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-documented static type alias for API paths, posing no security risk, malware threat, or obfuscation concern. All reports correctly assess it as safe, with scores of zero across malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
