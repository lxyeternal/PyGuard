{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Pydantic model representing the OpenAPI schema (version 3.1.1 or 3.1.0). It serves as a static data structure for API documentation and validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines class attributes and default values within the schema.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code does not perform data processing or runtime actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with standard use of Pydantic for schema definition. The conditional configuration based on PYDANTIC_V2 is a compatibility measure, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured Pydantic model for the OpenAPI specification. It includes optional fields, default values, and version-dependent configuration. There are no dynamic code executions, external data handling, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The use of 'extra=\"allow\"' is a common pattern for schema flexibility. The imports are standard, and the overall design is typical for schema definitions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard schema definition for OpenAPI using Pydantic. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
