  "purpose": "Define the data model for an OpenAPI 3.1.1/3.1.0 document using pydantic models for validation and structure.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, pydantic, openapi_pydantic, and relative module components; class attribute definitions; default values; optional fields.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input directly; no network, file, or system command operations present.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code mainly defines data structures and does not process external data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes typical pydantic model definitions with no suspicious logic, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The 'extra' configuration allows additional fields, which is standard for flexible schemas. No unusual dynamic code execution, network calls, or file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an OpenAPI schema model using pydantic, including required and optional fields, default values, and conditional configuration based on pydantic version. No functions, external data processing, or potentially dangerous code are present. The use of 'extra=allow' in model configuration is standard for schema extensions. No malicious or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data schema definition for OpenAPI documents using pydantic. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious logic, and no signs of sabotage or malware. The presence of version-specific configuration is normal and does not pose security risks.",
