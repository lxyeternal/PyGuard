  "purpose": "Define the data model for the OpenAPI specification using Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, Pydantic, and internal modules; class attributes defining the OpenAPI schema.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data leading to potential security issues; class attributes are mostly data definitions.",
  "flows": "Data is primarily used for schema validation and serialization; no flow of untrusted data to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Pydantic model defining the structure of an OpenAPI document. It uses type annotations and optional fields to match the OpenAPI spec. The only conditional configuration based on PYDANTIC_V2 appears to be standard practice for compatibility and does not introduce any malicious logic. No dynamic code execution, external command calls, or data handling that could be exploited is present. The code is purely declarative schema definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe schema definition for OpenAPI using Pydantic, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
