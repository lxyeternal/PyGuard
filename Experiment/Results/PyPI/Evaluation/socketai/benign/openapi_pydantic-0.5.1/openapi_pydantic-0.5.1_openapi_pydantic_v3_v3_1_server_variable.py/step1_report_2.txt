  "purpose": "Define a Pydantic model for server variables used in API specifications, including optional and required fields.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class attribute definitions and optional configuration imports. No external data inputs are processed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only sets up a data model.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. Use of conditional model configuration based on Pydantic version appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data model with optional and required fields, along with descriptive docstrings. It conditionally sets configuration based on Pydantic version, which is a standard pattern. No code executes external commands, network operations, or handles untrusted input. The import statements and class definitions are static, and the logic is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious Pydantic model definition for server variables. No security risks, malware, or obfuscated code are detected.",
