  "purpose": "Define a data model for server variables used in API URL templates with optional validation and configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing', 'pydantic', and 'openapi_pydantic.compat'; class attributes and their default values; conditional configuration settings.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data handling that leads to potential data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no untrusted data sources or data flow logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Use of conditional configuration based on external variable 'PYDANTIC_V2' is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic model 'ServerVariable' with optional fields and a required default field. It conditionally sets model configuration based on the 'PYDANTIC_V2' flag. The class is well-structured, uses standard validation patterns, and does not include any data processing, external inputs, or insecure practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data model for server variables with no malicious intent, security vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. It adheres to standard practices and does not perform any harmful operations.",
