  "purpose": "A data model representing a Server Variable for OpenAPI server URL template substitution, used for schema validation and documentation.",
  "sources": "Reads static class attributes and optional fields; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static schema definition without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'extra=\"allow\"' or 'Extra.allow' permits additional fields, but this is standard and not suspicious in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Pydantic model defining server variables with optional enum and description, and a required default. It includes conditional configuration for Pydantic version compatibility. No external data processing, network activity, or code execution occurs. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The configuration allowing extra fields is common in schema definitions and does not introduce security risks here. The high confidence scores and zero malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified based on the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data schema for OpenAPI server variables with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
