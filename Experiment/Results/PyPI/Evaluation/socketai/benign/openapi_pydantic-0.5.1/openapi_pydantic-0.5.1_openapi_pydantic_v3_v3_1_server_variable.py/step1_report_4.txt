  "purpose": "Define a Pydantic model for server variables used in OpenAPI specifications, including optional enum, default, and description fields.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attribute definitions, conditional configuration setup based on PYDANTIC_V2.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks, external communications, or unsafe evaluations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; configuration setup does not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs observed. Conditional configuration based on PYDANTIC_V2 is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a Pydantic model with optional fields, and conditionally sets model configuration based on the version of Pydantic. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code adheres to standard practices for model definition and version compatibility handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a Pydantic model for OpenAPI server variables with proper configuration handling. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
