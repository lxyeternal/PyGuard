  "purpose": "Define a data model for server variables used in OpenAPI specifications, supporting optional descriptions, enumerations, and default values.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through the class attributes during object instantiation, specifically 'enum', 'default', and 'description'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include usage of the class in processing user-supplied data, but no direct data sinks like network transmission or file writing are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the instantiation of ServerVariable objects with input values for 'enum', 'default', and 'description' to internal storage, with no processing or external output shown.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; code contains standard class definition and configuration logic. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic model with optional and required fields to represent server variables. It includes conditional configuration based on Pydantic version, which is typical for compatibility. There are no inputs, outputs, or external data handling within this snippet. No signs of malicious or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard data model for use in OpenAPI processing, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
