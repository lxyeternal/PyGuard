  "purpose": "Import statements for OpenAPI v3.1 components and related classes/functions.",
  "sources": "Local module imports from .parser and .v3_1 modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, external interactions, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules/classes; no runtime data flow or external data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward import statements importing classes and functions from local modules. There is no dynamic code execution, data processing, network activity, or use of untrusted data. The import pattern is standard for a package handling OpenAPI schemas. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The minimal code structure indicates a benign setup with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements for OpenAPI components. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The initial assessments are accurate, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
