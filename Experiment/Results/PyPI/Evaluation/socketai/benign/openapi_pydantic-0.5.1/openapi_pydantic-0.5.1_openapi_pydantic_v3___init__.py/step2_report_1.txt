  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Import statements for OpenAPI v3.1 components.\n- Source & Sink: Only local imports; no data processing.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Straightforward, standard import statements with no malicious indicators.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign setup.\n- Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, importing OpenAPI components.\n- Source & Sink: No data flow or external interactions.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard package import pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: No security concerns.\n- Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Importing OpenAPI v3.1 components.\n- Source & Sink: Only internal imports, no data processing.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical package setup, no signs of malicious code.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign.\n- Confidence: 0.9, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (slightly higher due to minimal concern about internal package structure, but still negligible)\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Importing API specification components.\n- Source & Sink: No external data or malicious activity.\n- Anomalies: Repeated imports from the same module, possibly auto-generated.\n- Analysis: Standard import pattern, no malicious indicators.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Importing components for API schema handling.\n- Source & Sink: Internal imports only.\n- Anomalies: Repetitive imports, possibly automated.\n- Analysis: Typical modular import pattern, no signs of malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, and the code consists solely of import statements. **Malware score should remain at 0.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward import statements. **Obfuscated score should be 0.**\n\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is purely import statements with no data processing, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns, the overall security risk is negligible. The only slight increase in report 3's risk score (0.1) is justified by the minimal concern about package structure but does not indicate actual risk. **Overall risk score should be 0.**\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.",
