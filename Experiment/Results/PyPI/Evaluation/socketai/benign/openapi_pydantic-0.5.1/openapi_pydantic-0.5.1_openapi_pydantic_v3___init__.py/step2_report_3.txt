  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the evidence, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report states that the code only contains import statements from local modules, with no dynamic execution or data processing.  \n- **Findings:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Conclusion:** The assessment appears accurate.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is just import statements with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malicious indicators.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and reasonable.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, straightforward imports from internal modules related to OpenAPI components.  \n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity; the code is typical for package setup.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Note:** The securityRisk score is slightly above zero, but given the code is just imports, this is likely an overestimation. It could be justified if the package is untrusted, but based solely on this code, the risk is minimal.  \n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is cautious but acceptable; the low securityRisk score is reasonable.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous reports, no suspicious patterns or anomalies.  \n- **Findings:** Standard import statements, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same pattern—imports from internal modules related to OpenAPI schema handling.  \n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and reasonable.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify that there is no malicious activity. The code is purely import statements, which are benign in this context.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward, with no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (import statements only), a risk score of 0 or very close to 0 is appropriate. The third report's slight securityRisk of 0.1 is acceptable but could be lowered to 0 for consistency.  \n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 for all, as no malicious behavior is evident.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all, as the code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk:** 0 for all, as the code only imports modules without any processing or external interactions.  \n\n**Additional note:** If this code is part of a larger package, the overall security posture depends on the entire package. But based solely on these import statements, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|---------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| 1       | 0               | 0                 | 0          |\n| 2       | 0               | 0                 | 0          |\n| 3       | 0               | 0                 | 0          |\n| 4       | 0               | 0                 | 0          |\n| 5       | 0               | 0                 | 0          |\n\n**Final note:** The initial reports are accurate; the code is benign and standard for a Python package importing internal modules.",
