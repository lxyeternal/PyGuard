  "purpose": "Definition of a Pydantic model for OpenAPI components, including various reusable objects.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are read; the code defines static classes and data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The _examples list is static sample data, not executing or retrieving external data. The code maintains standard Pydantic model structure with conditional configuration based on version, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic model for API components, with optional attributes for various reusable schemas, responses, parameters, etc. It includes a static examples list used for schema documentation purposes. No external data sources or dynamic inputs are processed. The conditional configuration based on PYDANTIC_V2 version does not execute untrusted code or introduce security risks. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are detected. The structure adheres to standard practices for schema modeling and configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data modeling module for API components using Pydantic. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security risks. The static examples serve as documentation aids, not executable or data-leaking code.",
