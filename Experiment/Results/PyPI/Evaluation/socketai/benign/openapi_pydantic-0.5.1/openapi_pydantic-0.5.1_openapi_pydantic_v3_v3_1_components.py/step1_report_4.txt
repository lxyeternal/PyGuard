{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for API components in OpenAPI specification using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "Imports, class definitions, and data structures within the code.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily defines static data structures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no runtime data processing or user input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The _examples variable contains sample data but no malicious content.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines a list of example data, and creates a Pydantic model 'Components' with various optional fields for API components. It conditionally sets configuration for Pydantic v2 or older versions. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The structure is typical for data modeling with Pydantic, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a schema definition for API components using Pydantic. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The only notable aspect is the inclusion of static example data, which is benign. Overall, it appears safe.",
