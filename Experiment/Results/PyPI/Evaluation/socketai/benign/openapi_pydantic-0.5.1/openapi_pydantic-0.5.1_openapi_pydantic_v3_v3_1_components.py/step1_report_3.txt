  "purpose": "Define a Pydantic model for reusable components in an OpenAPI Specification, including schemas, responses, parameters, etc.",
  "sources": "Imports of libraries and modules, and the embedded _examples data structure.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No untrusted input handling, network operations, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static data structures and class definitions; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard data modeling with no unusual or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines example data for documentation purposes, and creates a Pydantic model class 'Components' with optional fields for various reusable OpenAPI objects. It includes conditional configuration for different Pydantic versions. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or suspicious logic. The embedded _examples data is static and harmless. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, well-structured data model definition for API components, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
