  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static import statements from a local package `.v3` and a logging setup. There are no dynamic behaviors, data processing, or external interactions. Therefore, **no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present** in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports uniformly describe the code as benign, with accurate reasoning. They correctly note the absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in their assessments.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. The obfuscated score is also 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements. The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is purely static imports and logging setup, **risk scores should remain at 0**. There are no indications of malicious intent, external data handling, or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations**  \nAll reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, reflecting no malicious activity. The code does not perform any network communication, data manipulation, or dynamic execution that could be malicious.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nNo reports make unwarranted assumptions; their conclusions are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent across reports, correctly reflecting the benign and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard boilerplate for importing modules and setting up logging, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary. The code is entirely benign, and the scores appropriately reflect this.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.  \n- Confirm that the code remains static and free of dynamic or external data handling before deployment or further analysis.",
