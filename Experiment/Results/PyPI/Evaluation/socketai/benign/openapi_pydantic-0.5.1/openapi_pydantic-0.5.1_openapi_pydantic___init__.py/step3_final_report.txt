  "purpose": "Static import statements for various components from the local '.v3' package and logging setup with NullHandler.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.v3' package modules and logging.getLogger call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static imports and logging configuration do not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or dynamic execution; purely static import and setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static imports of classes and functions related to OpenAPI components from a local package, indicating setup or boilerplate code. The logging configuration adds a NullHandler to prevent logging errors. There are no data flows, external interactions, or dynamic behaviors. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is typical for initializing modules in a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of static imports and logging setup. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are detected. The scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, reflecting its safe and standard nature.",
