{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility layer for different versions of Pydantic (1 and 2)",
  "sources": "import statements, type annotations, conditional code branches based on version",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Conditional imports and definitions depending on Pydantic version, no untrusted data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows standard version-conditional import patterns, no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages compatibility across Pydantic versions using conditional imports and stub definitions. It reads version info from pydantic.version, which is a controlled attribute. The code defines various placeholders and type annotations, but these are standard for maintaining compatibility. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no network or file operations are present. All operations appear to be static and intended for type checking or interface compatibility. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility layer with no malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard Python practices for version-dependent imports and definitions. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
