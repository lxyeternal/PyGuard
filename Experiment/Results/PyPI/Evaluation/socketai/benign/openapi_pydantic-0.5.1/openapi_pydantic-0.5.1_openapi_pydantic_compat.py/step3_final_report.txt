{
  "purpose": "Provides a compatibility layer for supporting both Pydantic v1 and v2 by conditionally importing modules, defining constants, and creating stub functions/classes based on the detected version.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from pydantic.version, conditional imports, and definitions based on version detection.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static code with no data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "Version detection from pydantic.version.VERSION leading to conditional imports and definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '...' in stub functions is standard for type hints; no malicious anomalies present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility layer that uses version checks to import appropriate modules and define placeholder functions/classes. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources. The use of '...' is typical for type stubs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident. The code's purpose is purely to maintain compatibility across library versions, with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and serves a compatibility purpose. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are justified and accurate.",
