{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility shims and abstractions for handling different versions of the Pydantic library (version 1 and 2) to ensure consistent API usage across versions.",
  "sources": "Reads static version string from pydantic.version, imports from pydantic based on version, and defines functions and classes that vary by version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input are present. The code does not write data to external systems, files, or networks.",
  "flows": "The flow is primarily conditional logic based on the detected Pydantic version; it selects which modules and constants to import and define, with no untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious behavior, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses straightforward version checks and imports. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines compatibility wrappers for different Pydantic versions. It reads the version string and uses conditional imports and definitions accordingly. The stub functions and classes are placeholders for cross-version compatibility. There are no signs of malicious code, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic. The code operates purely at the static level, managing version differences. It is a standard pattern for maintaining backward compatibility and does not involve any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility layer for different versions of Pydantic, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs version checks and conditional imports, and defines functions/classes accordingly. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
