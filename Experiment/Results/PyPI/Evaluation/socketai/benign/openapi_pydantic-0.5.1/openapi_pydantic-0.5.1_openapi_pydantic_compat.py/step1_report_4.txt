{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility support for different versions of the Pydantic library (versions 1 and 2), defining stubs, type aliases, and utility functions accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from pydantic.version, imports from pydantic and pydantic.schema, and defines functions and classes based on version checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs; no network, file, or environment variable access occurs.",
  "flows": "Version check determines which set of imports, classes, and functions are used. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. The code primarily sets up version compatibility and type stubs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports version info from pydantic, checks the major version, and conditionally defines or stubs various classes, functions, and constants to ensure compatibility between Pydantic versions. It uses standard Python practices such as conditional imports and function definitions. No malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward compatibility layer with no suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility layer designed to support multiple versions of Pydantic without introducing security risks or malicious behavior. It employs common programming patterns and contains no suspicious or malicious elements.",
