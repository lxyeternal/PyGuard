{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility layer for Pydantic versions 1 and 2, defining stubs and importing relevant modules accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reading Pydantic version string, importing modules, defining functions and classes based on version.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or data output that could lead to leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Version check leads to importing different modules and defining different classes and functions depending on the Pydantic version.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns. The code strictly manages compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by determining the Pydantic version from an imported string, then defines a set of classes, functions, and constants differently based on the version. It uses standard Python idioms and imports, with conditional imports and stub definitions to support multiple library versions. No dynamic execution, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code is structured to provide compatibility, not to perform malicious actions. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code does not perform network communication, system modifications, or other malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign compatibility layer designed for handling differences between Pydantic versions. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation appears straightforward and well-structured, with no suspicious or harmful logic.",
