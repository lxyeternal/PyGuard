{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility layers for using Pydantic version 1 or 2, defining type stubs, constants, and functions depending on the version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Pydantic version, conditional imports, and defines functions and classes based on version checks.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external network interactions are observed.",
  "flows": "The version check determines which set of functions, classes, and constants are used, but there are no flow paths involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains multiple stub functions and classes with '...' indicating placeholders; this may be considered unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs version-dependent imports and definitions for Pydantic compatibility. It conditionally imports modules, defines constants, and creates stub functions for different Pydantic versions. No external data sources, sinks, or malicious code behaviors are identified. The use of '...' in stubs is typical for type hints and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be standard version compatibility handling with no malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility layer for Pydantic, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily uses conditional imports and stub functions to support multiple library versions.",
