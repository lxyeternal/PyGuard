  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with malware and obfuscation scores of 0. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is justified by the regex usage but remains negligible. Overall, the supply chain security risk for this code is minimal."
