{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, specifically for building and distributing the 'azure-mgmt-eventgrid' package.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from a version.py or _version.py file; reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files; uses environment variables indirectly via file paths; imports standard modules and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'setup()' function to package the project; no untrusted data is passed into critical functions that could lead to code execution or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file, then passes static or derived data into setup(), with no external or untrusted data flow into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is a standard package setup script, with clear, well-structured file reading and package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script performs file existence checks and reads static files for version, readme, and changelog content. It dynamically constructs file paths based on the package name, then extracts version info via regex. All data used in setup() are static or controlled, with no user input or external data sources involved. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or anomalies are present. The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup configuration script for a Python package. It safely reads necessary files and configures package metadata without executing untrusted code or containing malicious logic.",
