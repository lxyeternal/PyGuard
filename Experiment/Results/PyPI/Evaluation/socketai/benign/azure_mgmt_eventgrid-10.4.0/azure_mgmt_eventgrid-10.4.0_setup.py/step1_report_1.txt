  "purpose": "This script configures the setup for packaging and distributing the 'azure-mgmt-eventgrid' Python library, including reading version info, metadata, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading version from version.py or _version.py, reading README.md and CHANGELOG.md files, environment variables are not used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data into critical system functions; setup() is called with controlled parameters.",
  "flows": "File reads version info -> uses regex to extract version -> reads static markdown files -> passes data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or backdoors. The version extraction assumes the presence of specific files and a particular pattern, but this is standard for packaging scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads static files for versioning and documentation, then calls setuptools.setup() with predetermined, controlled parameters. It does not process user input or untrusted data. The only potential concern is the regex used for version extraction, but it relies on static files and does not execute untrusted code. All dependencies are specified explicitly and there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code adheres to common packaging practices without any suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It safely reads version and documentation files, then configures package metadata for distribution.",
