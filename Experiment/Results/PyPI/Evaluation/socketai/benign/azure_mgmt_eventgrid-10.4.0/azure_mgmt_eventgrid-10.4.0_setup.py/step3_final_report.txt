{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads version info and documentation files, then invokes setuptools.setup() with controlled parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from local files; reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No dangerous sinks; static data used for package configuration.",
  "flows": "File reads and regex extraction of version info, then passing data into setup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns; regex for version extraction is standard and operates on trusted local files.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package. It performs static file reads for versioning and documentation, then calls setup() with predefined parameters. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The regex used for version extraction is a common pattern and safe in this context. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The overall design adheres to best practices for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with malware and obfuscation scores of 0. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is justified by the regex usage but remains negligible. Overall, the supply chain security risk for this code is minimal.",
