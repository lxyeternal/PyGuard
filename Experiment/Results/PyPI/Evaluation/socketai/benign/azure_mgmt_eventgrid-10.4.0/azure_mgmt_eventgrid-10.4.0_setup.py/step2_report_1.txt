  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package.\n- No suspicious network activity, dynamic code execution, or untrusted data processing is detected.\n- The only potentially risky part is the regex used for version extraction, but it operates on static files and is a common pattern in packaging scripts.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The script relies solely on local files and static data, which are typical for setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or malicious code are present in the script.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The only minor concern is the regex for version extraction, which assumes the presence of a specific pattern in version files. However, this is standard practice and not inherently insecure.\n- **Scores given:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores are very low or zero, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate. No malicious activity, code injection, or backdoors are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate. The code is clear, readable, and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very close to zero. The only potential concern is the regex-based version extraction, but this is a common, controlled pattern with no malicious intent.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- One report assigns a security risk of 0.1, citing the regex as a minor concern. This is a very conservative overestimation, but given the context, it's acceptable as a negligible risk.\n- All other reports confidently state no risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks; minor concern about regex, but negligible)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThis script is a standard, benign setup script used for packaging a Python library. It follows common practices, reads static files, and does not process untrusted input or perform any risky operations.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
