  "purpose": "A test suite for listing Azure EventGrid topics by subscription and resource group, using Azure SDK and pytest.",
  "sources": "SDK calls to list topics, resource group names, and environment setup utilities.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmission; solely SDK API calls and assertions.",
  "flows": "Source: SDK listing functions; Sink: API responses used in assertions; No untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated test suite for Azure SDK operations. It performs standard API calls with no dynamic code execution, user input, or external data processing. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. The security risk is minimal, consistent with test code, and no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing Azure EventGrid management functionalities. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and poses no security threat. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of approximately 0.1 is appropriate given its nature as test code.",
