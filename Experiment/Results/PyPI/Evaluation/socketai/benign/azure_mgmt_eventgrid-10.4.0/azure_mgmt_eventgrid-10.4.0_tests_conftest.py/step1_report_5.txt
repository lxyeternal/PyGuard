{
  "purpose": "This code sets up test fixtures and sanitizers for testing Azure SDK interactions, specifically sanitizing sensitive environment variables and headers during test recordings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET), HTTP headers, JSON response body",
  "sinks": "Sanitized variables used in headers and JSON bodies, potentially affecting test output or logs but not directly affecting runtime execution security",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at the start; sanitized in test proxy fixtures; headers and JSON keys are sanitized during testing to prevent leakage",
  "anomalies": "Use of default placeholder values for sensitive credentials; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; standard sanitization approach; no suspicious or malicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, loads environment variables, and sets up sanitizers to mask sensitive information during testing. The environment variables are used to fetch credentials, which are then sanitized to prevent leakage in test recordings. The sanitizers for headers and JSON keys are standard procedures to ensure sensitive data does not appear in logs. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code's structure and content are typical for test setup and do not indicate obfuscation or malware. All actions are related to secure testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test setup for sanitizing sensitive information during automated tests. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks beyond the use of placeholder credentials intended for safe testing environments. The overall security risk is low.",
