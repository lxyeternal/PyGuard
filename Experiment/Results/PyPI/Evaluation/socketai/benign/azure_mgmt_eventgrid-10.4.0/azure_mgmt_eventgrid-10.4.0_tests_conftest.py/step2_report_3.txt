  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code primarily loads environment variables containing sensitive credentials.\n- It applies regex sanitizers to mask these secrets in test recordings.\n- Headers like \"Set-Cookie\" and \"Cookie\" and JSON body keys like \"$..access_token\" are sanitized.\n- Default placeholder values (\"00000000-...\") are used, which are typical in test environments.\n- No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is evident.\n- The code appears to be standard test infrastructure code with no obfuscation or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** perform any malicious actions.\n- The use of default placeholder secrets is acceptable in testing but could be risky if defaults are used unintentionally in production.\n- No actual vulnerabilities or malware are present.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The only potential concern is reliance on default values, which could lead to mishandling if these defaults are used outside testing.\n- No code logic errors or security flaws beyond this placeholder usage.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which is correct. No malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Low, mostly due to default placeholders but not a direct vulnerability.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- The risk score is generally low (around 0.1-0.3), which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The only reason for any slight increase is the default placeholders, which could be misused if not replaced, but this is a standard practice in test code.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The risk scores are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1-0.3 (due to default placeholders, but overall low risk)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (acceptable in test environments, but caution if defaults are used in production)\n\n**Summary:** The code is standard test setup code with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores given are reasonable, and I agree with the overall assessment that this code is safe in the context of testing.",
