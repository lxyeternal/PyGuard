{
  "purpose": "The code is a pytest fixture setup for sanitizing sensitive information in test recordings, specifically for environment variables and headers.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET), request headers (Set-Cookie, Cookie), and response body (access_token).",
  "sinks": "Sanitized data is used within the testing framework to prevent leakage of sensitive credentials; no data is sent externally or stored in a malicious manner.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read as sources, then sanitized before use in test recordings; headers and body data are sanitized before being stored or processed further.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded default values for critical credentials, which could be a security risk if these defaults are ever used in production or overlooked; the code primarily sanitizes data but the presence of defaults suggests potential mishandling of secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables that contain sensitive credentials and applies regex sanitization to mask these secrets in test recordings. It also sanitizes headers and response body tokens to prevent exposure. The presence of default values for secrets indicates a potential security concern if defaults are used inadvertently. Overall, the code does not perform malicious actions but handles sensitive data in a way that could be risky if defaults are not replaced with real secrets.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed for test environment sanitization of sensitive data, with no malicious intent detected. However, the use of default placeholder secrets may pose a security risk if those defaults are not replaced in production environments. The code itself does not exhibit malware behavior or security vulnerabilities beyond the handling of default secrets.",
