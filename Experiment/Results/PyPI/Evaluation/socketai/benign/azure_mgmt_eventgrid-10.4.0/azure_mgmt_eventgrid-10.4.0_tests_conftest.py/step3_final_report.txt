  "purpose": "Sanitizes environment variables, headers, and response body tokens during testing to prevent sensitive data leakage.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET), headers ('Set-Cookie', 'Cookie'), JSON response key ('$..access_token')",
  "sinks": "Regex sanitizers applied to masking sensitive data in test recordings; no direct data leaks or external effects observed",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and masked; headers and JSON keys are sanitized before being recorded",
  "anomalies": "Use of default placeholder values ('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000') for secrets, which could be risky if used outside testing context",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables containing sensitive credentials, applies regex sanitizers to mask these secrets in test recordings, and sanitizes specific headers and JSON keys. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The use of default placeholders is typical in test environments but could pose security risks if defaults are used inadvertently in production. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious behavior. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score is low (around 0.1 to 0.2), primarily due to reliance on default placeholders, which should be replaced with actual secrets in production to avoid mishandling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test sanitization setup with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The main concern is the use of default placeholder secrets, which are acceptable in testing but should be replaced in production. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the risk score should be around 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern. Overall, the code is safe and benign within its testing context.",
