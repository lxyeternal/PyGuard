{
  "purpose": "The code sets up environment variable sanitization for use in testing to avoid sensitive data exposure in recordings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "sinks": "Sanitization functions that replace sensitive data in logs and recordings",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at the start, then sanitized in test recordings via regex and header/body sanitizers",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets other than placeholders; sanitization is standard for testing",
  "analysis": "The script loads environment variables containing sensitive Azure credentials, then applies sanitization to prevent leakage in test recordings. It uses regex and header/body sanitizers to mask these secrets, which is a common practice in test environments. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code does not perform any external connections, data exfiltration, or covert activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard testing utility to sanitize sensitive information from test recordings. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
