{
  "purpose": "Set up environment sanitizers for testing, anonymizing sensitive data such as credentials and tokens in recordings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET), data in HTTP headers and response bodies during tests.",
  "sinks": "Sanitizers applied to environment variables, headers, and JSON response bodies to prevent leakage of sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Sensitive environment variables are used as regex patterns for sanitization; these patterns are then used to scrub matching data in headers and response bodies during test recordings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of default dummy values for environment variables, which indicates testing configuration; no malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables that typically contain sensitive credentials, then applies sanitizers to remove or mask such data in test recordings. All patterns and sanitizers are standard for testing security. No hardcoded secrets aside from defaults, no network connections, no data exfiltration or malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is intended for secure testing practices, specifically sanitizing sensitive data in test recordings. No malicious behavior or malware is present. It follows best practices for avoiding credential leaks during testing.",
