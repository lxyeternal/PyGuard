  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward, generated test suite for Azure EventGrid SDK, with no malicious activity or anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes standard testing code with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 — the risk score is slightly above zero, but since the code is purely testing Azure SDK calls with no untrusted data, this seems overstated.  \n- **Recommendation:** I suggest lowering the security risk score to 0, as no actual security concern exists.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard Azure SDK testing code with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 — again, a slight overstatement.  \n- **Recommendation:** Lower to 0.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; legitimate test code, no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 — probably overstated.  \n- **Recommendation:** Lower to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe code that is a standard test suite for Azure SDK, with no malicious or suspicious logic.\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, as expected.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, but given the nature of the code, this is unwarranted.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, as there are no security concerns.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code does not process untrusted input, execute system commands, or handle secrets.\n- The tests are using recorded responses, which is standard practice.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, standard testing code for Azure SDK, with no security threats or malware. The slight elevation in the security risk score in some reports is unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n**My recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0\n\nLet's proceed with these justified scores.",
