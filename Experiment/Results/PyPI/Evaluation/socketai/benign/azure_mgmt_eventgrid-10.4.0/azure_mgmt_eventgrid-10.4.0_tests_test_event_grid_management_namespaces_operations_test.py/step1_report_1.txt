  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for Azure EventGridManagementClient, specifically testing listing namespaces by subscription and resource group.",
  "sources": "Imports azure.mgmt.eventgrid, devtools_testutils, pytest, and AzureMgmtRecordedTestCase; uses resource group name as input.",
  "sinks": "Response from client.list_by_subscription() and list_by_resource_group() methods; no untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Test methods call Azure SDK functions which return data; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code; code is standard test setup with generated code comments and licensing notices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, generated test suite for Azure SDK without any suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors. It relies on SDK methods that are presumed safe. No untrusted data is processed insecurely. No evidence of malicious intent or malicious payloads is present. The code's structure is typical for test automation and includes no suspicious or anomalous behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate test code generated by a standard SDK generator. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is safe and trustworthy.",
