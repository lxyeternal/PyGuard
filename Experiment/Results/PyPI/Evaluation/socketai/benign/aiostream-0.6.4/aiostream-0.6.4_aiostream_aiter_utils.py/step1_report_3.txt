  "purpose": "Utilities for managing asynchronous iteration, including context management and helper functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type hints, and method definitions accessing object attributes such as __aiter__, __anext__, athrow, aclose.",
  "sinks": "Potential attribute access like __aiter__, __anext__, athrow, aclose, and external calls like athrow and aclose on iterators, which could be misused if iterators are maliciously overridden.",
  "flows": "Functions like aiter, anext, aitercontext, and methods within AsyncIteratorContext interact with async iterable/iterator attributes, with flows involving calling __aiter__, __anext__, athrow, and aclose methods, potentially passing malicious data if underlying objects are malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of attribute checks and dynamic method calls is standard for async iteration management. No suspicious external network calls, data leaks, or malicious file operations are present. The use of warnings and RuntimeErrors for control flow is typical for resource management.",
  "analysis": "The code provides helper functions for async iteration including aiter, anext, and context management via AsyncIteratorContext. It verifies object capabilities via hasattr, manages async iterator lifecycle with warnings and errors, and wraps functions into coroutines. The context management handles potential misuse and cleanup of async iterators with no external or malicious side effects. No evidence of malicious intent such as data theft, network communication, or backdoors. The attribute checks are standard for async iteration; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility library for async iteration management. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. It mainly handles iteration protocol compliance and resource cleanup without external network or data access.",
