  "purpose": "Utilities for asynchronous iteration, including context management and helper functions.",
  "sources": "Attribute access methods (__aiter__, __anext__, athrow, aclose), input parameters to functions, and internal type checks.",
  "sinks": "Potential attribute access points that could be misused if underlying objects are malicious, such as __aiter__, __anext__, athrow, aclose.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (objects with async iteration methods) are checked and used via attribute access; no external data flows or network interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard use of async iteration protocols and context management.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility module for async iteration, employing typical Python async protocols, with proper safeguards and exception handling. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external data leaks are present. The attribute access patterns are standard for async iterators and do not indicate sabotage. The security risk is minimal, justified by the potential misuse if objects are maliciously overridden, but this is inherent to any such pattern. The malware score is zero, aligning with the absence of malicious activity. Obfuscation is not present. The overall confidence in these conclusions is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for async iteration with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
