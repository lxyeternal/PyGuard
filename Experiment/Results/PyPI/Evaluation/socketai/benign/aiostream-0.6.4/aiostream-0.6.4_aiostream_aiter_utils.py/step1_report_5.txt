  "purpose": "Provides utilities for managing asynchronous iteration, including context management and helper functions for async iterables and iterators.",
  "sources": "Reads include usage of object attributes (__aiter__, __anext__, __athrow__, __aenter__, __aexit__, aclose, athrow), and internal type assertions and checks.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the attribute access for 'athrow', 'ag_frame', 'ag_running', 'aclose' which could potentially be misused if user-controlled objects are used, but only in the context of intended async iterator control.",
  "flows": "Input objects (async iterables/iterators) are checked for async capabilities, then managed through context with safe handling of exceptions, and cleanup via aclose, with exception propagation and handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code appears to follow standard async iterator and context management patterns. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variables are evident. Use of 'cast' is safe in context and justified. No code appears to send data over network or interact with system files.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions and a class for handling asynchronous iteration safely with context management. It includes methods for advancing, throwing exceptions into, and closing async iterators, with proper exception handling and state management. All attribute access and method calls are consistent with Python's async iterator protocols. No external system interactions, network access, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears standard and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility library for async iteration and context management. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. All operations are within expected asynchronous programming patterns, with no evidence of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious code. The code is safe for inclusion in larger projects.",
