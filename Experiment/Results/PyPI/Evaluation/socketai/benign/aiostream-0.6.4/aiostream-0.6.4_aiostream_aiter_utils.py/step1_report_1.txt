  "purpose": "Provides utilities for asynchronous iteration, including context management and helper functions for async iterables and iterators.",
  "sources": "Imports standard library modules, type annotations, and internal functions for async iteration.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or data leak points are apparent; no external data transmission or storage is observed.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves checking and handling async iterables and iterators, with functions wrapping and managing iteration and context.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. Usage of warnings for improper iteration outside context is standard. No suspicious code injection, network calls, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for asynchronous iteration, including safe iteration, type checks, and context management via AsyncIteratorContext. It includes careful handling of iteration states and proper cleanup in __aexit__, preventing misuse. All functions rely solely on standard Python features for managing async iteration. No external network access, data leaks, or malicious actions are present. The focus is on safe iteration and context handling, with no suspicious behavior or sabotage identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured utility module for async iteration, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It employs standard patterns for async context management and iteration safety. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
