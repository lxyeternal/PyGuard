{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to gather and import all stream operator modules for a larger data processing or streaming framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: create, transform, select, combine, aggregate, time, misc, advanced",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks identified in this snippet",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only performs imports, which do not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports (*) can be risky if modules are manipulated, but this is common in package structures; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from various local modules, intended to include multiple stream operators. There are no functions, data processing, or network operations. The structure appears typical for a package's __init__.py or module aggregator, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are evident. This pattern is common in modular Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import aggregator without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain suspicious or malicious code, and its purpose seems benign.",
