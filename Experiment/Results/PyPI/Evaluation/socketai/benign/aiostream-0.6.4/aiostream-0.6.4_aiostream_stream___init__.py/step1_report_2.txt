  "purpose": "To import all stream operator functions from various modules within the package.",
  "sources": "The code imports everything from multiple modules in the current package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only module imports are performed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) can lead to namespace pollution, but it is not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs import statements using wildcard imports, which can be risky for namespace management but does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or other malicious behaviors. No external network connections, file modifications, or hidden behaviors are evident. The code's structure is straightforward and standard for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module aggregation with wildcard imports. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks based on the content provided.",
