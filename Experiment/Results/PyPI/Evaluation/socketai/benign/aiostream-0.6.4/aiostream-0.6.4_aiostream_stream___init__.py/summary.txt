  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module aggregator with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The use of wildcard imports is a style concern but does not impact security. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware likelihood is zero. The reports' assessments are accurate; minor adjustments to risk scores are unnecessary."
