  "purpose": "Module aggregator importing all stream operator submodules for simplified access.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules using wildcard imports.",
  "sinks": "No data input or output operations; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules; no data flow or execution beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports, which can cause namespace pollution but are common in __init__.py files.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements aggregating multiple modules. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. Wildcard imports are a style concern but do not constitute security risks. The code's purpose is to organize and expose multiple stream operator modules for ease of use. The absence of any runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions indicates a benign and standard pattern for package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module aggregator with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The use of wildcard imports is a style concern but does not impact security. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware likelihood is zero. The reports' assessments are accurate; minor adjustments to risk scores are unnecessary.",
