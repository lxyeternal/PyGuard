{
  "purpose": "Provides async aggregation functions (accumulate, reduce, list) for processing asynchronous data streams.",
  "sources": "Async iterable source data, accessed via streamcontext and anext utilities.",
  "sinks": "Internal data processing; no external sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source through functions, with no external data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard async aggregation utilities using asyncio, context managers, and type annotations. It processes data streams securely without external side effects. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. External modules used are typical for stream processing and do not introduce risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of async aggregation operators with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.",
