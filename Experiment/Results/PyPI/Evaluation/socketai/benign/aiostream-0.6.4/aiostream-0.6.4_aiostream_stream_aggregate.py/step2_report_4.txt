  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report states the code implements async aggregation operators with input from 'source'. Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks or leaks, consistent with code.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code is standard, using asyncio, context managers, and type annotations. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate utility functions. Risk score: **0**.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, consistent.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks; data processed internally.\n- **Anomalies:** No unusual code patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Uses standard async patterns, proper coroutine handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe code. Risk score: **0**.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No red flags.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Functions are straightforward, no external network or file I/O, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard async aggregation code. Risk score: **0**.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly identified as benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** As above.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks or leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Standard async code, no malicious behaviors, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility functions. Risk score: **0**.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Well-structured, standard async pattern usage, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code. Risk score: **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Scores:** All 0 or very low (0.1 at worst), which aligns with the benign analysis.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of async aggregation operators.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising features are present.\n- The scoring across reports is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk Score:** 0 — minimal security risk, standard utility code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-implemented, and free of malicious or obfuscating features. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified based on the code's nature.",
