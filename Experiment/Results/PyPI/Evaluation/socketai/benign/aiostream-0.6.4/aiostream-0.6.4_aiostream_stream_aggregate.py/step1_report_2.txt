{
  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous aggregation operators such as accumulate, reduce, and list for processing async iterables.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the provided AsyncIterable 'source' in the accumulate, reduce, and list functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no untrusted data is being sent to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'source' through accumulate, reduce, or list functions; accumulation and list building happen internally without external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. No dynamic code execution or suspicious variable misuse.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard async data processing functions using asyncio and type annotations. It safely handles asynchronous iteration, awaits coroutine functions properly, and yields accumulated or collected results. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects are present. The use of 'streamcontext' and 'select' appears to be standard stream processing, with no suspicious external communications or data leaks. The code structure and logic are straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard asynchronous aggregation operations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility module for async stream processing.",
