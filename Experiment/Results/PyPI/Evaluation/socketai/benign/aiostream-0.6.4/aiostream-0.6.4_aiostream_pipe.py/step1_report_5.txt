{
  "purpose": "The code gathers and re-exports various pipe operators from a 'stream' module for use in data processing pipelines.",
  "sources": "Imports the '__future__' annotations feature and all 'stream' module functions accessed via 'stream.<name>.pipe'.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present in this code snippet; it only re-exports stream pipe operators.",
  "flows": "The flow involves accessing 'stream.<operator>.pipe' for multiple operators, but no data flows are implemented here; this code only assigns references.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. No dynamic code execution or external data access observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations, then defines a series of variables assigned from the 'stream' module's attributes, specifically the 'pipe' attribute of various functions. This appears to be a straightforward collection of operator references for use elsewhere. There are no input reads, data processing, or untrusted data flows within this snippet. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, file access, or obfuscation. The structure is simple and clear, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This module merely re-exports stream pipe operators for convenience. It contains no malicious or security-risk code. There are no anomalies, and the code appears safe.",
