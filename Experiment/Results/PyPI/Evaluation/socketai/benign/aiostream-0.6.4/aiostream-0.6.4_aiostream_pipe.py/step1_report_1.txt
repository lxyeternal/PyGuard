{
  "purpose": "The code re-exports pipe attributes from various modules within the 'stream' package for easier access or aggregation.",
  "sources": "Imports the current module, and accesses attributes from the 'stream' module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data output or external communication in this snippet",
  "flows": "Directly assigns stream.<name>.pipe to local variables; no data flow analysis as this is a simple re-export",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected; code structure is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations, then assigns multiple stream module attributes (assumed to be objects with a 'pipe' attribute) to local variables. It functions as a collection of re-exports for pipe operators from the 'stream' package. No data manipulation, input reading, or external communication occurs. The structure is simple, with no dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns, and no embedded secrets.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward re-export of pipe operators from the 'stream' package. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code's purpose appears to be for convenience or API organization without any suspicious or harmful intent.",
