{
  "purpose": "Re-export stream operator 'pipe' attributes for simplified access and organization.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it references attributes from the 'stream' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns references internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'annotations' for future compatibility, then imports a local 'stream' module. It assigns multiple variables to 'stream.<operator>.pipe', effectively creating aliases for these stream operators. The code is static, with no input/output, network activity, or dynamic execution. It serves as a utility or organizational module to simplify access to stream operators. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, secrets, or vulnerabilities are evident. The structure is straightforward, and the purpose is clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static re-export module with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and 0 for security risk, are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
