{
  "purpose": "The code re-exports various stream operator pipes from the 'stream' module for easier access.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'stream' module and accesses its attributes for pipe properties.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs are evident; the code only re-exports attributes.",
  "flows": "The code assigns 'stream.<operator>.pipe' to local variables, establishing a direct reference flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward and serves as a re-export.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module and creates references to its 'pipe' attributes for multiple stream operators. No data processing, user input, or external data sources are involved. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious data flows. The structure is simple, aiming to provide aliasing for stream operators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module that facilitates easier access to stream pipe operators without any malicious intent or security risks. It neither reads input nor performs any operations that could lead to data leakage or harm.",
