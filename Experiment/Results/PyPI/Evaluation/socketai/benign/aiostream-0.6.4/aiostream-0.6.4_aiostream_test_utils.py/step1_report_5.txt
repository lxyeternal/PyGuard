  "purpose": "Utilities for testing stream operators in asyncio-based Python code, including resource management, event loop simulation, and assertions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially 'import asyncio', 'from unittest.mock import Mock', and usage of environment-related modules like 'asyncio' and 'Mock'. The code reads input data from async streams and fixtures. It accesses the current event loop via 'asyncio.get_running_loop()'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any known sink points such as network operations, file writes, or data exfiltration. No untrusted data is sent over networks or written to files.",
  "flows": "Data flows through async generators and fixtures, primarily for testing. Input data is read from async streams, and exceptions are compared or results are asserted. There are no external system calls or data exfiltration paths.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses 'Mock()' for the event loop, which is typical in testing but does not by itself indicate malicious intent. The code is purely test utilities with no embedded or hidden commands. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines test utilities for asyncio streams, resource management, and event loop simulation. It employs standard Python testing practices, uses 'asyncio' and 'pytest' fixtures, and does not include any network or system manipulation commands. The use of 'Mock' is consistent with testing and does not pose a security risk. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's structure and imports are standard, with no suspicious patterns. It is focused solely on testing stream behaviors and resource cleanup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of testing utilities for asyncio stream operators, with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It employs standard practices for testing and resource management. The code appears safe and intentionally designed for testing purposes only.",
