  "purpose": "Utilities for testing stream operators, resource management, and exception handling within asyncio-based code.",
  "sources": "Internal functions, mock objects, asyncio event loop, resource counters, and fixtures; no external data inputs or network operations.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network connections, or data exfiltration points; all data handling is internal and confined to testing context.",
  "flows": "Source data (streams) are processed through internal context managers and coroutines; no external sinks or untrusted data flows outside the test environment.",
  "anomalies": "None; code uses standard testing patterns, mocks, and resource tracking without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured testing utility for asyncio stream operators, employing custom event loops to simulate time and resource management. It includes functions for asserting stream outputs and exception handling, all within a controlled test environment. No malicious behaviors, external data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. The resource counters and mock objects are typical for testing frameworks. The code is clear, well-organized, and purpose-specific.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-built testing utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are accurate and appropriate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
