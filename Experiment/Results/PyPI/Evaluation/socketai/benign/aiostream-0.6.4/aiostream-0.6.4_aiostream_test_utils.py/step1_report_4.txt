  "purpose": "Utilities for testing stream operators and event loop behavior in asyncio, including resource management and timing simulation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries and third-party modules, especially asyncio and pytest. Functions like add_resource, assert_aiter, assert_await, and fixtures accessing event loops and stream sources.",
  "sinks": "None evident. The code mainly handles testing infrastructure, resource tracking, and exception comparison without writing or transmitting data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows mainly within testing functions: source streams are iterated, exceptions are caught and compared, and resources are tracked. No external data transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. Usage of asyncio mocks and custom event loop classes are consistent with testing. No obfuscated or misleading code. The resource management is explicitly controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code defines testing utilities for stream processing, with resource tracking via a custom event loop class. The functions add_resource, assert_aiter, and assert_await perform validation of stream outputs and exception handling. The custom event loop class tracks time, resources, and scheduled timers. Fixtures facilitate testing with controlled event loops. No external network access, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior detected. The code does not include any malicious payload or covert channels; it strictly serves testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a testing utility module designed to simulate and verify stream processing behaviors with resource and time management. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. It is a safe and well-structured testing scaffold.",
