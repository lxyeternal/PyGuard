  "purpose": "Utilities for testing stream operators, including custom event loop and resource management for asyncio-based stream testing.",
  "sources": "Imports (asyncio, unittest.mock, pytest), streamcontext, and internal functions from .core.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that untrusted data flows into. No network or file operations, no eval or exec, no data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from test streams through context managers and async iterators; no external or untrusted sources are directly read or manipulated in an insecure manner.",
  "anomalies": "The custom event loop tracks internal timing and resource management but does not perform any suspicious actions. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. No code injection or obfuscation observed. Use of Mock is typical for testing, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utilities to simulate and test asyncio streams and resource management with a custom event loop that tracks resources, timing, and state. The functions 'add_resource', 'assert_aiter', and 'assert_await' test stream behaviors. The custom event loop 'TimeTrackingTestLoop' manages internal timers, resources, and time advancement. No external data input, network operations, or code injection mechanisms are present. The code is purely for testing and simulation purposes, with no malicious intent or harmful behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test utility module implementing a custom asyncio event loop and stream testing helpers. It contains no malware, no malicious behaviors, and poses no security risks. It is designed solely for testing stream operators in an isolated environment.",
