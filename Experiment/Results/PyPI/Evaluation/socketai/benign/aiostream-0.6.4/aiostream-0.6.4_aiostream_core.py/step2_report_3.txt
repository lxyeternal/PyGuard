  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described code with the provided source, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on core classes and decorators for stream operators, emphasizing safe iteration, piping, concatenation, and context management.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no external communication, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. The code employs dynamic class creation and signature modifications, which are standard in such frameworks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low).\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. No malicious activity is evident. The low security risk score seems appropriate, given the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe iteration, operator creation, and signature handling.\n- **Findings:** No external communication, no data exfiltration, no suspicious behaviors. Signature modifications and dynamic class creation are typical for decorator-based API design.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent with the code. The low risk score is justified. No malicious indicators are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes core objects, utilities, decorators, and validation steps for stream processing.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or malicious code. Use of `assert_async_iterable` is a validation step, not malicious. Signature and class creation are standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies the code as a safe, standard implementation. The zero risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Details core classes, decorators, and stream operator mechanisms, with focus on safe iteration and extensibility.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behaviors, no network or file operations, no obfuscation. Signature handling and dynamic class creation are typical for such libraries.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis aligns with the code's intent. The minimal risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing safe, pipable, and variadic operators, with proper validation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behaviors, no external data leaks, no suspicious code. Dynamic class creation and signature modifications are standard for decorator-based APIs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe conclusion is consistent with the code. No malicious activity is indicated.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify zero malware risk. The code is purely about stream management, operator creation, and context handling.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero obfuscation is evident; the code is transparent and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero but very low, reflecting the code's benign purpose. The scores ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 are reasonable.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, readable code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Minimal risk, primarily due to dynamic class and signature manipulation, which is standard in such frameworks.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured framework for asynchronous stream processing. No signs of malicious activity, supply chain attack, or sabotage are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
