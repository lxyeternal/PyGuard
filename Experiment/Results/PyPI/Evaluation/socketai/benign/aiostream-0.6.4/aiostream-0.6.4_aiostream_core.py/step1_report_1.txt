{
  "purpose": "Define core classes and decorators for creating and managing asynchronous stream operators, enabling pipe-lining, concatenation, slicing, and context-safe iteration for asynchronous data streams.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and functions such as 'inspect', 'functools', 'warnings', and local modules like '.aiter_utils' and '.stream'. Defines functions and classes that create streams and stream operators.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data output points are present that handle untrusted data directly. The code primarily sets up stream management and operator creation, without external data injection or output.",
  "flows": "Operators and decorators generate stream objects (Flow: factory functions -> Stream objects -> operator functions), with no external untrusted input handling within this code segment. Internal flows include method wrapping, signature modifications, and class type creation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. No suspicious network connections, file operations, or privacy violations. Use of warning for deprecated argument hints at code maintenance but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a framework for creating, piping, and managing asynchronous stream operators with proper typing, signature handling, and context management. It employs dynamic class creation, static method decorations, and signature modifications, all within typical stream operator design patterns. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or sabotage mechanisms are present. The code emphasizes safe iteration and operator composition without external dependencies that suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a well-structured framework for asynchronous stream processing, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It focuses on functional enhancements, operator decoration, and type safety, without any suspicious network, file, or privacy-invasive actions.",
