  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code's behavior, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as defining core classes and decorators for async stream management. No issues.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks; the code mainly sets up stream objects and operators.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, credentials, or backdoors. Use of warnings for deprecated args is standard maintenance.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded; no malicious behavior, high confidence (0.9). Obfuscated: 0, Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully aligned. No issues. Score seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious data sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; signature modifications and dynamic class creation are typical for such frameworks.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate. No malicious activity detected. Confidence at 0.9 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as stream utilities and decorators.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data exfiltration or malicious sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns. Signature handling and dynamic class creation are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well justified. Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct overview.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or data leaks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code; dynamic class creation is typical for decorators.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate. Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No malicious signs.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious behavior. Signature modifications are standard for decorators.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid. Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code analysis—no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, as the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), reflecting low inherent risk due to dynamic class creation and signature modifications, which are standard in such frameworks but could be misused if misapplied.\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, typical for dynamic signature and class handling)\n\n**Given the detailed review, I concur with the scores provided.** There are no indications of supply chain or malicious code issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0              |\n| Risk           | 0.1–0.2        |\n\nThis code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured framework for asynchronous stream management with no malicious intent.",
