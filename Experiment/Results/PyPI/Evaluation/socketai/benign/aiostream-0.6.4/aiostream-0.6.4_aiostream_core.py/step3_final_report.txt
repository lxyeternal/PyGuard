{
  "purpose": "Defines core classes, decorators, and utilities for asynchronous stream processing, including context management, operator creation, and stream composition.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are asynchronous iterables provided to stream objects and operators; no external data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data exfiltration points; the code manages internal stream objects and operator wrapping.",
  "flows": "Flow involves creation and manipulation of async iterables through decorators, dynamic class creation, and signature modifications, with no external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected. Signature modifications and dynamic class creation are standard in decorator-based APIs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured framework for asynchronous stream management, employing dynamic class creation, signature manipulation, and context handling. No malicious behaviors, external data leaks, or obfuscation patterns are present. Signature modifications are typical for decorators and do not indicate malicious intent. The dynamic class and method adjustments are standard in such libraries for API flexibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-designed async stream utility library with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The assigned scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1—are justified and appropriate given the code's purpose and implementation.",
