  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described logic with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Accurate; describes core classes, decorators, and imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: No external data sinks; internal flow is primarily stream creation and operator wrapping.\n- **Anomalies**: No malicious code detected; warnings are for deprecation, not security.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Correct; the code is a framework for async streams with no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence**: 0.9, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2 — seems reasonable.\n\n**Verdict**: The report is accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correct; describes core objects, stream management, and operator creation.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: No external data sinks; flow involves async iterables and operator wrapping.\n- **Anomalies**: No malicious code; dynamic signature modifications are typical for such frameworks.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Accurate; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence**: 0.9, malware: 0, risk: 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict**: The report is consistent; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correct; similar overview.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: No external sinks; internal flow is stream and operator management.\n- **Anomalies**: No malicious code; signature modifications are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Valid; no malicious intent.\n- **Confidence**: 0.95, malware: 0, risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict**: Accurate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correct; describes core objects and decorators.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: No external data sinks; flow is internal stream composition.\n- **Anomalies**: No suspicious code; dynamic class creation is common in decorator frameworks.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Valid; no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence**: 0.9, malware: 0, risk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict**: No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correct; focuses on core classes and operator decorators.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: No external sinks; flow involves assertions and operator wrapping.\n- **Anomalies**: No suspicious code; signature modifications are typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Accurate; no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence**: 0.9, malware: 0, risk: 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict**: The report is consistent; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior; malware score should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: The code is clear, with no obfuscation patterns; obfuscated should stay at **0**.\n- **Risk Score**: Given the absence of external data leaks, network activity, or malicious code, the overall security risk remains very low. The highest reported risk is 0.2, which is acceptable.\n\n### Final Recommendation\n\n- **Malware**: 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk**: 0.1 to 0.2, consistent with the reports.\n\n**Overall**: The code is a legitimate, well-structured async stream utility framework with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n---\n\n**Final note**: I would assign my own estimates as follows:\n\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0.1 (consistent with reports)\n\nThis confirms the assessments in the reports.",
