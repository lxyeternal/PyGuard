{
  "purpose": "This code provides generator-based operators for asynchronous iteration in a stream processing library, including module imports, versioning, and exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.stream, .pipe, .aiter_utils, .core). No external input sources or data reads are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are evident; no data output, network connections, or external data transmission is present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports and re-exports functions and classes, with no data flow or processing logic involving untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior detected. The code is straightforward, with standard import and export statements, no hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a module initializer, importing specific functions and classes from local submodules and defining its __version__ and __all__ exports. It does not process any user input, read external data, or perform any runtime operations that could introduce security risks. No external connections, network activity, or untrusted data flows are present. The structure and syntax are standard for a Python package __init__.py file, indicating no malicious intent or anomalous behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module initializer for a Python asynchronous stream library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. It simply imports and exposes components of the package.",
