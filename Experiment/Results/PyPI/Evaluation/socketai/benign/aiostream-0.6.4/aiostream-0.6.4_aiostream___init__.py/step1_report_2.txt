{
  "purpose": "This code provides generator-based operators for asynchronous iteration, including modules, core objects, and utility functions for stream processing and testing.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules (.stream, .pipe, .aiter_utils, .core) and the setting of __version__ and __all__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform any data output operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code is mainly imports and module exports without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules and functions necessary for stream processing and sets versioning and export variables. All operations are static and standard for a package's __init__.py or main module file. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. No code injection, external network operations, or sensitive data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initializer for a Python package related to asynchronous streams. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
