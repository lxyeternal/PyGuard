{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer (__init__.py) for an asynchronous stream utility library, importing core modules, setting version info, and defining exports.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules and utilities; no external data input or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations; no external communication or data transmission.",
  "flows": "The code only imports and exposes internal components; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static module setup typical for Python packages, with no runtime data handling, network activity, or malicious patterns. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's static and transparent nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe and straightforward nature, and the scoring is appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
