{
  "purpose": "The code provides generator-based operators for asynchronous iteration, including core objects, utilities, and module exports for stream processing.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.stream, .pipe, .aiter_utils, .core). No external data input sources or untrusted input handling are present.",
  "sinks": "No sink points such as network connections, file writes, or data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up imports and exposes module attributes without processing untrusted data or executing external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code consists of straightforward module imports, documentation, and exports.",
  "analysis": "This code is a standard module initialization script that imports various submodules and objects, sets a version, and defines its __all__ exports. There are no input handling, no external data processing, and no suspicious behaviors such as dynamic code execution or network activity. It appears to be a typical package setup for asynchronous stream utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module setup with no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely as an import and export hub for a larger package.",
