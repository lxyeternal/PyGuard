{
  "purpose": "This code provides generator-based operators for asynchronous iteration in a Python module, exposing core objects, utility modules, and version info.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing internal modules (.stream, .pipe, .aiter_utils, .core) and metadata variables (__version__, __all__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink locations such as network, file, or environment variable manipulations are present",
  "flows": "The code imports and re-exports various functions and classes; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources are evident",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. All code is standard module import and export syntax",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package initializer (__init__.py) that imports internal modules and exposes certain functions and classes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. The module seems to be a straightforward library setup with versioning and API surface definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initialization script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It mainly serves to organize and expose components of the package for external use.",
