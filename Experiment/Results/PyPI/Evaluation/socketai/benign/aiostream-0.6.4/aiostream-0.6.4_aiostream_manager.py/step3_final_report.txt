  "purpose": "Utility classes for managing multiple concurrent asyncio streamers, handling task creation, cancellation, and cleanup within context managers.",
  "sources": "Input streams via AsyncIterable objects passed to enter_and_create_task; internal task creation via anext on streamers.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; task cancellation and cleanup do not involve data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "flows": "Streamers are entered, tasks are created with anext, and on cancellation or cleanup, tasks are canceled and streamers are closed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors; exception handling during cancellation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard asyncio patterns for managing multiple streamers, with proper resource cleanup and exception handling. No signs of malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The exception suppression during task cancellation is typical in async cleanup routines. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign, utility nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured asyncio utility for managing concurrent streamers. It shows no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scoring (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) is appropriate and should be maintained.",
