{
  "purpose": "Provides context management for running multiple asynchronous streamers concurrently, including task creation, cancellation, and cleanup.",
  "sources": "Reads input from async iterables (streamers), creates asyncio tasks, and manages task states.",
  "sinks": "Potentially cancels and cleans up streamers; no evident data leaks or external data output.",
  "flows": "Streamer input -> task creation and management -> task cancellation and cleanup; no external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Use of standard asyncio functions and context managers. No suspicious external network activity or hidden behaviors. Code appears well-structured for task and streamer management.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a structured approach to managing multiple async streamers with proper context handling, task creation, and cleanup. It uses asyncio features like ensure_future, wait, and cancel, which are standard for concurrency control. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious patterns identified. The use of AsyncExitStack and proper cancellation procedures indicates good practice, not malicious intent. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, well-structured, and focused on concurrency management. No signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks detected. The implementation aligns with typical async pattern usage for managing streamers.",
