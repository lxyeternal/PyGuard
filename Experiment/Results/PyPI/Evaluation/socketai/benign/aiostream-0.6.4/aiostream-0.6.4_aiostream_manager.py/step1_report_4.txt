{
  "purpose": "Manage and coordinate multiple asyncio streamers concurrently, providing context management and task handling.",
  "sources": "Input streamers (via streamcontext and async iterable sources), internal task creation and cancellation functions.",
  "sinks": "Cancellation of tasks, closing of streamers, async exit stack operations.",
  "flows": "Streamers are entered, tasks are created from streamers, tasks are waited on (any/all), and streamers are cleaned up or cancelled.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or unusual language features. Usage of asyncio features appears standard. No code that sends data over network, logs, or stores sensitive info. No backdoors or hidden code. The code primarily manages streamers and tasks, with no external data transmission or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements an asyncio-based context manager for handling multiple streamers, creating tasks for asynchronous iteration, and ensuring proper cleanup. It uses standard asyncio patterns such as ensure_future, wait, cancel, and context management with AsyncExitStack. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed. All functions perform expected resource management, task cancellation, and streamer closure without any sign of data leakage, external communication, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for managing concurrent streamers in an asyncio environment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. It appears to be a legitimate utility module with proper asynchronous resource handling.",
