  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described code, and assess the scores and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code manages asynchronous streamers using asyncio, with context managers, task creation, cancellation, and cleanup.\n- No suspicious or obfuscated code patterns are present.\n- No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- Exception handling during task cancellation is standard practice.\n- The code appears to be a legitimate utility for concurrency management.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose & analysis:**  \nAccurately describes the code as managing multiple streamers and tasks, with proper cleanup and no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 (low, given it's a utility module)\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe high confidence (0.9) aligns with the code review. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose & analysis:**  \nSame as above, consistent description, no suspicious elements.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 (still low)\n\n**Justification:**  \nAgain, no signs of malicious behavior, and the confidence (0.9) is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose & analysis:**  \nSimilar to previous, with emphasis on standard asyncio patterns, no external network or data leaks.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.1\n\n**Justification:**  \nConsistent with the previous assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose & analysis:**  \nHighlights proper resource management, no suspicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Justification:**  \nNo evidence of malicious activity, scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose & analysis:**  \nAgain, confirms the code's utility nature, no malicious behaviors.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Justification:**  \nScores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, malware score should be **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; should remain **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the utility nature, low security risk (around 0.1–0.2) is appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low, as it's a concurrency utility with no external dependencies or network activity)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately score the code as benign. No changes are necessary. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured asyncio utility with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
