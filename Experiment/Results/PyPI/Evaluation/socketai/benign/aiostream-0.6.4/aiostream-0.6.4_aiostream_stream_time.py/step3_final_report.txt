  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous timing control utilities: spaceout, timeout, and delay functions for async iterables.",
  "sources": "Reads from async iterable sources via streamcontext; no external inputs or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Yields items to downstream consumers; no data leaks or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Source streams through streamcontext, with timing controls via asyncio.sleep and asyncio.wait_for, then yields items.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard asyncio-based timing utilities with clear, straightforward logic. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The functions rely on well-understood asyncio constructs and context managers. External utilities like streamcontext and anext are assumed safe and standard. The minimal security risk score (0.1) in some reports appears conservative; given the benign nature, a risk score of 0 is justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of async timing operators with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The overall security risk is negligible, and malware and obfuscation scores are zero.",
