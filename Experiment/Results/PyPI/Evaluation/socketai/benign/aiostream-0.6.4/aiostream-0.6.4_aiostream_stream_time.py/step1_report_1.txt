  "purpose": "Provide time-specific operators for asynchronous sequences, including spacing out items, timing out on slow items, and delaying sequence start.",
  "sources": "Reads from provided AsyncIterable source via streamcontext and anext functions.",
  "sinks": "Yields items to consumers; no sinks that handle untrusted data or external systems.",
  "flows": "Source (async generator) -> streamcontext context manager -> anext/async for loop -> operator logic (sleep/timeout) -> yield to caller.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three asyncio-based operators that modify the timing of async sequences: spaceout, timeout, and delay. They use standard asyncio functions and context managers, and the logic aligns with typical async flow control. No data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious network activity is present. The functions operate solely on sequence timing without any hidden or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard timing utilities for asynchronous sequences with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and uses standard patterns without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
