{
  "purpose": "Provides time-based operators for asynchronous iterables, including spaceout, timeout, and delay functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads from the provided async iterable source via streamcontext and anext.",
  "sinks": "Uses asyncio.sleep and asyncio.wait_for for timing control, no data sinks that leak or exfiltrate data.",
  "flows": "Source data flows through streamcontext, gets delayed or timed out via asyncio functions, then yields back.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three async operators for time control: spaceout, timeout, and delay. All functions use standard asyncio methods for timing, with proper context management via streamcontext. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. The use of asyncio for timing and iteration appears standard and safe. No suspicious side-effects or anomalies are present. The code is clean, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of time-based async operators with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and aligns with typical async pattern usage.",
