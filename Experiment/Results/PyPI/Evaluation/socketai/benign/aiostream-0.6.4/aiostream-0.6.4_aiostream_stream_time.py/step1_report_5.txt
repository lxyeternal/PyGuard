  "purpose": "Provide time-based operators for asynchronous iterables, including spacing out items, timing out, and delaying sequence iteration.",
  "sources": "Read from the 'source' AsyncIterable via 'streamcontext' context managers and 'anext' for individual items.",
  "sinks": "Yield items to downstream callers; no data sinks or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "Read data from 'source' within 'streamcontext', process via asyncio functions, then yield to caller.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. Uses standard asyncio patterns and context managers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three asynchronous operators: 'spaceout', 'timeout', and 'delay', which manipulate the timing of async sequences. Each function correctly uses 'streamcontext' to manage source streams and employs asyncio features as intended. No external data leaks, malicious commands, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be a standard utility module for asynchronous timing control, with proper use of asyncio constructs and no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implements legitimate timing utilities for async sequences, and shows no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
