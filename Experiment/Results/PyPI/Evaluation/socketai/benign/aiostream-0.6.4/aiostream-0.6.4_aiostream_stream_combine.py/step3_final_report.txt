  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous sequence operators for combining, mapping, merging, and manipulating async iterables in Python.",
  "sources": "AsyncIterable inputs from function parameters, internal context managers, and async iteration constructs.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; data is processed and yielded within the functions, primarily in-memory.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through various operators (zip, map, merge, etc.) to the output iterators; no external network or file I/O observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Use of enum for sentinel is standard; no dynamic eval or misleading constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard async stream utilities with proper resource management, concurrency, and iteration control. No external system calls, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code relies on well-understood asyncio patterns and internal context management. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are evident. The functions are designed for safe, in-memory async data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured async stream processing library with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The small security risk score (0.2) reflects minimal inherent risk, mainly considering potential misuse if untrusted functions are supplied, but no actual malicious activity is present.",
