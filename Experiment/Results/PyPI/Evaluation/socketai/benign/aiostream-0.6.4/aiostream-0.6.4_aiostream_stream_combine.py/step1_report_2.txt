{
  "purpose": "The code provides asynchronous sequence combination and manipulation operators such as chain, zip, map, merge, ziplatest, amap, and smap for use in asynchronous programming workflows.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from AsyncIterable sources via functions like anext, streamcontext, and async for loops.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed within the functions; no explicit sinks for untrusted data are present. No network, file, or external system interactions are detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources into functions like zip, smap, amap, etc., where functions process and combine data. No external sinks or outputs are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are identified. No obfuscation, misleading variables, or unnecessary dynamic execution are observed. Use of enum for sentinel value is standard. All functions seem to perform legitimate asynchronous sequence operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements common asynchronous sequence operations with proper context management and concurrency handling. No suspicious external network calls, credential handling, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code relies on standard Python async patterns and external utility modules (assumed to be safe). No code injection, malicious data leaks, or covert operations are evident. The overall structure and logic are consistent with safe asynchronous data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured implementation of asynchronous sequence operators with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and appropriate for use in Python async workflows.",
