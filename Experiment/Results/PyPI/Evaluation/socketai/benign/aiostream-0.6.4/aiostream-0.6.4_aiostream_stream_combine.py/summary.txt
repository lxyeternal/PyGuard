  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured async stream processing library with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The small security risk score (0.2) reflects minimal inherent risk, mainly considering potential misuse if untrusted functions are supplied, but no actual malicious activity is present."
