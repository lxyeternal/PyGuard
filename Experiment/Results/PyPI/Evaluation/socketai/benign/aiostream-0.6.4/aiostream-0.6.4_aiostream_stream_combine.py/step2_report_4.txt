  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes async stream operators and their data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; functions process data internally, no external data sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Well-reasoned; no signs of malicious activity, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.2, Confidence 0.95 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning is sound. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes async sequence operators and data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks; data processed internally.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard asyncio usage.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Logical; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0, Confidence 1 — consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-founded reasoning; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar description.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data processed within functions; no external sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or external calls.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly reasoned; no malicious behavior evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.2, Confidence 0.9 — aligned with findings.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; standard async operators.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks; data flows are internal.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard async patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Consistent; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.2, Confidence 0.9 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-justified; scores match the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks; internal processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious constructs; standard usage.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriate; no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.2, Confidence 0.9 — fitting.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is valid; scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No issues or malicious code detected.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None; all reports correctly identify the code as standard async sequence utilities.\n- **Score justification:**\n  - Malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given no malicious behavior.\n  - Security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in such utility code.\n  - Confidence levels are high, matching the thorough reasoning.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, standard async patterns.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 — low, due to the nature of the code being utility functions without external system interactions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and appropriately scored. No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured asynchronous stream processing utility library with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores reflect this accurately.",
