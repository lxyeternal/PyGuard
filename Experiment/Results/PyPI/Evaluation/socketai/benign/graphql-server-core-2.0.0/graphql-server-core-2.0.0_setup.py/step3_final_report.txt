  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project, defining dependencies, metadata, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, dependency declarations, static metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static configuration with no source-to-sink data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It imports setuptools functions, defines fixed dependency lists, reads a local README.md file for the long description, and calls setup() with standard metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or user inputs. The only file I/O is reading a local file, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The dependencies are explicitly versioned, and the overall structure is conventional. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The minimal risk associated with reading a file is justified and common practice. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the static, benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is a standard, safe package configuration script with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
