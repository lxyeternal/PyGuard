{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for the Python package 'graphql-server-core'.",
  "sources": "Open 'README.md' file for long description; hardcoded package metadata and dependency lists.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; no network or data output beyond package metadata.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read 'README.md' without sanitization; standard package setup code with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, defines dependencies, and calls setup() with package metadata. The only potential concern is reading the README file directly, which is common practice and not malicious. No dynamic code execution, environment variable misuse, or suspicious network activity observed. The code is typical for Python package configuration and contains no signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply specifies package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
