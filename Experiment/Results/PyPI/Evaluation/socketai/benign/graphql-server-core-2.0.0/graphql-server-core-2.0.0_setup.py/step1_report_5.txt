  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for packaging and distributing a Python library called 'graphql-server-core'.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies, and configuration data such as README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; no external data being processed or sent over the network.",
  "flows": "Reads data from local files (README.md), package metadata, and static dependency lists; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. Usage of standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package, importing 'setuptools' for packaging, defining dependencies, and setting package metadata. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network operations are present. No untrusted input sources or suspicious data flows identified. The dependencies are fixed version strings, and the code interacts only with local files and package data.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks. The overall security risk score is very low.",
