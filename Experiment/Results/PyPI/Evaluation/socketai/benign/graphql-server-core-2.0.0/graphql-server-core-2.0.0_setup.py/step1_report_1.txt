  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'graphql-server-core' Python package, including dependencies, metadata, and package information.",
  "sources": "Constants and data structures for dependencies, package metadata, and setup arguments.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sources or execution sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows into the setup() function, which orchestrates package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns. The only file I/O is reading README.md for description, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static configuration for packaging using setuptools. It imports setup and find_packages, defines dependency lists, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No untrusted data sources, code injection, or network activity is present. The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, nor does it contain obfuscated logic. The only notable activity is reading a README file, which is standard. Dependencies are clearly specified with version constraints, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code appears safe and standard for package distribution.",
