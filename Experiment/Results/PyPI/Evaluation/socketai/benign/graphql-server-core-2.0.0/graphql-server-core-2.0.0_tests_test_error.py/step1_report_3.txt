  "purpose": "Unit tests for the HttpQueryError class in graphql_server module",
  "sources": "Import statement importing HttpQueryError; test functions creating instances of HttpQueryError",
  "sinks": "Assertions comparing properties and hashes of HttpQueryError instances",
  "flows": "Creating HttpQueryError instances (source) -> Accessing properties and methods (sink) -> Assertions (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. All tests seem straightforward and intended for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class HttpQueryError and defines test functions to verify its initialization, comparison, and hashing behaviors. The tests involve creating instances with specific parameters and asserting expected attribute values and hash behaviors. There is no evidence of data leakage, malicious code, or suspicious activities. The code appears to be standard unit testing for a class, with no external data inputs, network activity, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard unit testing code for the HttpQueryError class, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs straightforward validation of the class’s methods and properties.",
