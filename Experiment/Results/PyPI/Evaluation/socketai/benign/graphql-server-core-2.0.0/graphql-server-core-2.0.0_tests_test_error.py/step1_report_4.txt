  "purpose": "Unit tests for the HttpQueryError class in the graphql_server module",
  "sources": "Import statement importing HttpQueryError from graphql_server",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; tests instantiate and compare HttpQueryError objects internally",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test functions that create instances of HttpQueryError, verify their attributes, and compare instances for equality and hashing. There is no data input, network activity, file I/O, or external interaction. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be straightforward test cases with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for a class, with no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and intended solely for validation purposes.",
