  "purpose": "Unit tests for the HttpQueryError class in the graphql_server module",
  "sources": "Import statement: from graphql_server import HttpQueryError; usage of HttpQueryError in test functions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no network, file, or external system interactions present",
  "flows": "Test functions instantiate and compare HttpQueryError objects, using hardcoded values; no data flow from external sources",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit testing of the HttpQueryError class, verifying its initialization, equality, and hashing behaviors. All data used are hardcoded test values. No external input handling, data leaks, or malicious code is present. The code is straightforward and serves as test cases.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for unit testing the HttpQueryError class, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It contains no malware or suspicious behavior.",
