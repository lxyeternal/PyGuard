{
  "purpose": "The code contains unit tests for the HttpQueryError class from graphql_server, verifying object creation, attribute correctness, equality, and hash consistency.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded values within the test functions, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or outputs involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded input values to assertions; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for unit testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests that instantiate HttpQueryError objects with fixed data, verify attributes, compare instances, and check hashes. There are no external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is simple, clear, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. All signals indicate benign, standard testing behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for testing the HttpQueryError class with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
