  "purpose": "Unit tests for the HttpQueryError class in the graphql_server module",
  "sources": "Import statement importing HttpQueryError from graphql_server",
  "sinks": "Assertions and comparisons involving HttpQueryError instances, no external data sources or sinks",
  "flows": "Object creation and comparison operations for HttpQueryError instances, primarily in local test scope",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard unit test patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test functions that instantiate, compare, and hash HttpQueryError objects. All operations are within the scope of testing the class behavior, with no external input handling, data leaks, or malicious patterns. The assertions verify object attributes, equality, and hash consistency, which are standard for unit tests. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The import statement is straightforward and relates to testing the class. Overall, the code appears purely for testing purposes with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of unit tests for the HttpQueryError class, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
