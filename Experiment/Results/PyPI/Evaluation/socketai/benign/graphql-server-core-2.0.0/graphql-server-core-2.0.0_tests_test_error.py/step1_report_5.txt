  "purpose": "Unit tests for the HttpQueryError class in the graphql_server module.",
  "sources": "Import statement for HttpQueryError; test functions creating and comparing error instances.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data flow observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only creates instances and performs comparisons.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The tests follow standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class and performs straightforward unit tests to verify initialization, equality, and hashing behaviors. No external data input, no network or file I/O, and no dynamic code execution are present. All operations involve only local object instantiations and comparisons, indicating standard test code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard unit tests for the HttpQueryError class, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
