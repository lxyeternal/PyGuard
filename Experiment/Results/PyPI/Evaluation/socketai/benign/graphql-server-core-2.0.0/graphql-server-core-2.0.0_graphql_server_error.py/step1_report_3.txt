{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling HTTP errors related to GraphQL queries.",
  "sources": "The constructor (__init__) method reads input parameters: status_code, message, is_graphql_error, headers. The __eq__ and __hash__ methods access object attributes and headers.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is transmitted or written to external systems within this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are stored as object attributes; __eq__ compares attributes; __hash__ computes hash from attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward and standard for an exception class.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class with standard __init__, __eq__, and __hash__ methods. It processes typical HTTP error data such as status codes, messages, headers, and flags indicating GraphQL errors. No external data sources or sinks are involved, and there are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of an exception class for HTTP GraphQL errors. No malicious intent or security issues are present.",
