  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling HTTP errors related to GraphQL queries.",
  "sources": "Input data includes constructor parameters: status_code, message, is_graphql_error, headers; and self.headers.",
  "sinks": "super(HttpQueryError, self).__init__(message) calls the base class constructor; other potential sinks include usage of headers in __hash__.",
  "flows": "Constructor receives input; sets attributes; calls superclass __init__ with message; __eq__ and __hash__ methods access headers and attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception class with an initializer that assigns parameters to attributes and calls the base class constructor. The __eq__ method compares error instances based on their attributes, and __hash__ creates a hash based on the attributes, including headers if present. All operations are standard and safe. No data leaks, no malicious code, and no suspicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a straightforward custom exception class for HTTP query errors in a GraphQL context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears safe and standard.",
