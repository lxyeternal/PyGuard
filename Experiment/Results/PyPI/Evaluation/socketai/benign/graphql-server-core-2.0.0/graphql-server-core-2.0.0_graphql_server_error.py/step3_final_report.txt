  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for handling HTTP errors in a GraphQL server context, encapsulating error details such as status code, message, headers, and error type.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to the constructor: status_code, message, headers, is_graphql_error",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems",
  "flows": "Error details are stored as attributes; no data flows to external sinks or network calls",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; headers stored directly without sanitization, but this is standard for error handling",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of a custom exception class. It stores error information and provides equality and hashing methods. No external data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The headers are stored as-is, which is typical and not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected. The class functions as intended without security flaws or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, secure, and standard. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
