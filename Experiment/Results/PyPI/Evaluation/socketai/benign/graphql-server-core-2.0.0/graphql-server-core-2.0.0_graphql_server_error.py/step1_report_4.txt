{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling HTTP errors in a GraphQL server context.",
  "sources": "Input data could be the status_code, message, is_graphql_error, headers parameters passed during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly send data to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Inputs (status_code, message, headers) flow into the exception object and are used in __init__, __eq__, and __hash__ methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The class primarily manages error information.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class for HTTP errors with standard methods (__init__, __eq__, __hash__). It uses parameters to store error details and supports comparison and hashing. No external data handling, network operations, or security-sensitive actions are present. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose in error management without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom error class for GraphQL HTTP errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
