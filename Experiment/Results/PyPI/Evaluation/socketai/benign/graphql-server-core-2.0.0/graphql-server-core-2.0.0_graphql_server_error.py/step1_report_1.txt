  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling HTTP errors in GraphQL server interactions.",
  "sources": "Input data includes status_code, message, is_graphql_error, and headers passed to the constructor.",
  "sinks": "None of the data is used directly in a way that could lead to code injection or data leaks; headers are stored as is.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into object attributes; used in __init__, __eq__, and __hash__ methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected; no dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward exception class inheriting from Exception, with typical __init__, __eq__, and __hash__ methods. No external input is processed insecurely. No network calls, no file operations, no credential handling, or obfuscated code. The class simply stores and compares error details. Overall, the code appears standard and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom exception class for GraphQL HTTP errors. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It functions as intended for error handling in a web server context.",
