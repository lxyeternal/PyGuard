  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines a custom exception class `HttpQueryError` for handling HTTP errors in a GraphQL context.\n   - It accepts parameters: `status_code`, `message`, `is_graphql_error`, and `headers`.\n   - Implements `__init__`, `__eq__`, and `__hash__` methods.\n   - Stores headers as-is without processing or sanitization.\n   - No external data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The class is straightforward, serving as an error container.\n   - No evidence of code injection, data leaks, or malicious payloads.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious logic.\n   - The headers are stored directly, which could be a minor concern if headers contain sensitive data, but this is typical for error handling and not inherently malicious.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The only minor point is that headers are stored as-is; if headers contain sensitive info, this could be a data leak, but that’s standard for error objects and not malicious.\n   - No evidence of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a standard, well-implemented custom exception class.\n   - No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimates:**  \nGiven the code's simplicity and lack of malicious or obfuscating elements, I concur with the existing scores. There are no security issues or suspicious behaviors.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, standard, and secure. The scores reflect this accurately. No adjustments needed.",
