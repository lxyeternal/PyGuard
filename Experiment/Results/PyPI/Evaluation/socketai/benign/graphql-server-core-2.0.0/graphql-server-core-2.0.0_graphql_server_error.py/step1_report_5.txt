  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling HTTP errors in a GraphQL server environment.",
  "sources": "Input data includes 'status_code', 'message', 'is_graphql_error', and 'headers' provided during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the attributes 'status_code', 'message', and 'headers' used in exception handling; no direct data leaks or system impacts evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the instantiation parameters into object attributes, with no external or untrusted data sources directly processed within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and typical for custom exception classes. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single exception class with methods for initialization, equality comparison, and hashing. It securely stores input parameters and uses standard exception handling patterns. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. No external data processing or network activity occurs. The class is isolated and simple, serving as a container for error information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign custom exception class for HTTP errors in a GraphQL server context. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
