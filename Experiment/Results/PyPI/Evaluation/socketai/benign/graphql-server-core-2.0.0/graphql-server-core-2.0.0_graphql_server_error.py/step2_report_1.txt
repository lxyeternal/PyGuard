  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Logical Consistency:**\n   - The code defines a custom exception class `HttpQueryError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - The constructor accepts `status_code`, `message`, `is_graphql_error`, and `headers`.\n   - The attributes are stored directly, and `super().__init__(message)` ensures the message is accessible via standard exception mechanisms.\n   - The `__eq__` method compares `status_code`, `message`, and `headers`, but notably omits `is_graphql_error`.\n   - The `__hash__` method includes `status_code`, `message`, and `headers`, again excluding `is_graphql_error`.\n   \n   **Observation:** The attribute `is_graphql_error` is stored but not used in equality or hashing, which could lead to inconsistent behavior if two errors differ only in this flag. However, this is a minor design concern rather than a security issue.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No code injection, dynamic execution, or data leaks are present.\n   - The class only stores and compares error information.\n   - Headers are stored as-is; no processing or serialization that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n   - No external data sources or sinks involved.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   \n3. **Obfuscation & Malware:**\n   - The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n   - No signs of malware or malicious intent.\n   \n4. **Scores & Reasoning:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n   - The security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty in the benign assessment.\n   \n5. **Potential Improvements:**\n   - Consider including `is_graphql_error` in `__eq__` and `__hash__` for consistency, but this does not impact security.\n   - No issues found that warrant raising the risk score.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, secure, and benign implementation of a custom exception class for GraphQL HTTP errors. It functions as intended, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No code issues or malicious behavior detected.  \n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.  \n- No changes needed.",
