{
  "purpose": "Convert a list of result objects into a list of dictionaries for comparison purposes.",
  "sources": "The 'results' parameter, which is an input to the function, presumably a list of objects with a method 'to_dict'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process untrusted data in a way that leads to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Input 'results' flows into the list comprehension, calling 'to_dict' on each item, and produces a list of dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward method call and list construction without hidden or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The function takes a list of objects, iterates over each, and calls 'to_dict' with a specified 'dict_class'. It returns a list of dictionaries. No external data is read, and there are no evident security risks or malicious behaviors such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function to convert objects into dictionaries. There is no malicious behavior or security risk present.",
