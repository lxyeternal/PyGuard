  "purpose": "Convert a list of result objects into a list of dictionaries for comparison.",
  "sources": "The 'results' list input, each 'result' object in the list.",
  "sinks": "The 'to_dict' method of each 'result' object, which may process or output data.",
  "flows": "Iteration over 'results' calling 'result.to_dict' for each item.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard serialization pattern. Potential concern if 'to_dict' is maliciously overridden, but not evident here.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple iteration over a list of objects, invoking their 'to_dict' method with a 'dict_class' argument. It relies on external object behavior, but the function itself contains no malicious or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data access are present. The security implications depend on the implementation of 'to_dict' in the objects, but the code snippet is benign. The function's purpose is straightforward, and no anomalies are detected. Given the simplicity and standard pattern, the likelihood of malicious intent is negligible. The 'to_dict' method could, in theory, be malicious if overridden, but this is outside the scope of this utility function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard serialization utility that converts objects to dictionaries. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores are appropriate, with malware, obfuscated, and risk scores all set to 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and non-malicious nature.",
