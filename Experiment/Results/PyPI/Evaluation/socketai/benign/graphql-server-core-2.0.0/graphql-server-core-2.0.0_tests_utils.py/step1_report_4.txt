  "purpose": "Convert a list of results into a list of dictionaries for comparison.",
  "sources": "The 'results' parameter, specifically the input list of result objects.",
  "sinks": "The 'result.to_dict()' method call, which converts objects to dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Results list -> to_dict() method -> list of dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard data conversion method.",
  "analysis": "The function takes a list 'results' and applies the 'to_dict()' method on each item, passing a 'dict_class=dict' argument. There is no evidence of hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious data handling. The method appears to be a straightforward data serialization process. No external data inputs, network connections, or file manipulations are present. The code is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard conversion of objects to dictionaries for comparison purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this snippet.",
