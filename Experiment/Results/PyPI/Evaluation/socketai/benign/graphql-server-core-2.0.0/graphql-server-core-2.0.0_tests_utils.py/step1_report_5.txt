  "purpose": "Convert a list of execution result objects to a list of dictionaries for easier comparison.",
  "sources": "The parameter 'results' which is expected to be a list of objects with a method 'to_dict'.",
  "sinks": "The 'to_dict' method invocation on each result object; no external data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Input 'results' → method 'to_dict' called on each object → output list of dicts.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The function takes a list of objects, iterates through each, and calls the 'to_dict' method with a 'dict_class' argument set to 'dict'. The implementation appears standard for serializing objects for comparison. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or data leaks. The code uses only common Python features and methods, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function for converting objects to dictionaries. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
