  "purpose": "Convert execution results to a list of dictionaries for comparison.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'results', which is expected to be a list of objects with a 'to_dict' method.",
  "sinks": "The 'to_dict' method called on each 'result' object; potential data transformation point.",
  "flows": "Input 'results' -> for each 'result', call 'result.to_dict' -> collect into list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and uses standard method calls.",
  "analysis": "The function takes a list of result objects, then iterates over them, invoking the 'to_dict' method with 'dict_class=dict' to convert each object to a dictionary. The purpose appears to be data formatting for comparison. No user input, network activity, or file access is present. The code relies on the 'to_dict' method, which could potentially be overridden, but this is standard behavior and does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The function is simple and serves a data transformation role.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard conversion of result objects to dictionaries for comparison, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
