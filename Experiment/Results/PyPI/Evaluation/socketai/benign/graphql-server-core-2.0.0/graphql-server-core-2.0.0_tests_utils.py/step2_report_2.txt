  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward utility function that converts a list of objects to dictionaries using `to_dict`.\n   - The code itself does not contain any malicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious behavior are identified in any report.\n   - The code relies on the behavior of `to_dict`, which is a common pattern in object serialization.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment; they correctly identify that the function is benign.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n   - The analysis correctly states that the function is a simple data transformation utility.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign zero risk, there is no need to justify higher scores.\n   - The code is benign, and the analysis supports that.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - No suspicious or malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the straightforward code and standard practices.\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n   - The uniformity supports the conclusion that this code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Expert Judgment:\n\nGiven the simplicity of the code and the thorough, consistent analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign utility function with no security concerns.",
