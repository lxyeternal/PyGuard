  "purpose": "Convert a list of result objects to a list of dictionaries for comparison purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'results', which is expected to be a list of objects with a 'to_dict' method.",
  "sinks": "The method 'to_dict' could potentially process untrusted data if the objects in 'results' contain or handle such data internally.",
  "flows": "Results list → Iteration → Each result → 'to_dict' method → Output list of dictionaries",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward conversion function. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The function accepts a list of 'results' objects, then returns a list where each object is converted via its 'to_dict' method, specifying 'dict' as the class. This is a standard pattern for object serialization. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data exfiltration. The 'to_dict' method's behavior depends on the implementation of the objects passed in but is not inherently malicious. No input validation or sanitization appears necessary here.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility function that performs data serialization. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
