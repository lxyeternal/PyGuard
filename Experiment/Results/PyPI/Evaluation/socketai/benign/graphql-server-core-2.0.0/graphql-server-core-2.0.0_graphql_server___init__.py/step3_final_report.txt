  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for handling GraphQL HTTP requests, including parsing, execution, and response serialization.",
  "sources": "Request data (query, variables, operationName), HTTP request body (JSON), optional query parameters.",
  "sinks": "JSON serialization (json.dumps), GraphQL execution (document.execute), error handling (HttpQueryError).",
  "flows": "Input data -> load_json_variables/load_json_body -> get_graphql_params -> execute_graphql_request -> format_execution_result -> JSON encode -> HTTP response.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity. Exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard GraphQL server utility module, using well-known libraries and patterns. It validates input, executes GraphQL queries, and serializes results with proper error handling. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent. Exception handling is contained, and external dependencies are standard. The code aligns with typical server-side request processing, and the security implications are minimal. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified based on the code's clarity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured GraphQL request handler with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware score of 0 is justified. The reports' assessments are consistent and accurate.",
