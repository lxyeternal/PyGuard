{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a core utility library for handling GraphQL HTTP queries, including parsing requests, executing GraphQL operations, and serializing results.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from HTTP request body (load_json_body, load_json_variables), request parameters (get_graphql_params), and execution options.",
  "sinks": "Outputs serialized JSON responses (json_encode, json_encode_pretty), and can execute GraphQL operations which may involve data retrieval or mutations.",
  "flows": "Input data (load_json_body, get_graphql_params) -> Execution functions (execute_graphql_request) -> Result formatting (format_execution_result) -> JSON serialization (json_encode) -> HTTP response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No backdoors or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical GraphQL HTTP request handler with functions to parse input, execute GraphQL queries, and serialize output. It includes error handling via HttpQueryError, supports batch requests, and integrates with promise-based execution. No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are evident. The logic is straightforward and adheres to expected patterns for such libraries.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of a GraphQL server utility. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code handles data securely and performs expected operations without evident security risks.",
