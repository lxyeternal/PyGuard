{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling GraphQL HTTP requests, including executing queries, encoding results, and parsing JSON data, intended for use in a GraphQL server implementation.",
  "sources": "Input sources include request data such as the 'data' parameter in 'run_http_query', JSON strings in 'load_json_body', and variables/queries in 'get_graphql_params'.",
  "sinks": "Data sinks include JSON serialization functions ('json.dumps'), error handling via 'HttpQueryError', and response formation in 'format_execution_result'.",
  "flows": "Input data from HTTP request bodies and query strings flow into 'get_graphql_params' and 'load_json_variables', which produce 'RequestParams'. These are used in 'execute_graphql_request' for query execution, with results processed by 'format_execution_result' and serialized via JSON in 'encode_execution_results'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code primarily performs data parsing, validation, and JSON serialization. No suspicious network calls, file access, or obfuscated constructs are observed. Exception handling is standard for input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a utility layer for GraphQL HTTP request handling, with functions for input validation, JSON parsing/serialization, and executing GraphQL queries. It includes error handling for invalid JSON, invalid parameters, and method restrictions. No code indicates malicious intent or malicious data exfiltration. No dynamic code execution beyond calling established GraphQL library functions. The structure and logic appear typical for a GraphQL server middleware, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility module for handling GraphQL over HTTP. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. It adheres to expected patterns for such server-side components and does not introduce security risks beyond standard input validation concerns.",
