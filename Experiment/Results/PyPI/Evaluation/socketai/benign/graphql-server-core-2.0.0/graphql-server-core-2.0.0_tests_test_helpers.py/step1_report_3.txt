{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and tests for encoding and decoding GraphQL-related JSON data, handling server responses, and formatting errors in a GraphQL server context.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include JSON strings from HTTP request bodies, such as 'load_json_body', and test inputs simulating GraphQL queries and variables.",
  "sinks": "Sinks include JSON serialization functions (json_encode, json_encode_pretty), and the load_json_body function which processes JSON payloads.",
  "flows": "Input JSON data flows through 'load_json_body' to be parsed into Python objects; these objects are then processed and encoded via functions like 'json_encode' or 'encode_execution_results', potentially generating server responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code uses standard libraries and practices; no signs of obfuscation, malicious network activity, or privacy violations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of test functions validating JSON encoding/decoding, GraphQL result formatting, and server response creation. It does not perform any network communication, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The use of exception handling in 'load_json_body' is standard. All functions utilize safe parsing and encoding techniques. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as hidden code, dynamic code execution, or data leaks, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of GraphQL server response handling and related tests. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks within this module. It performs expected operations in a secure manner.",
