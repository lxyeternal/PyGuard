  "purpose": "Unit tests for GraphQL server utilities, including JSON encoding, request parsing, and result encoding.",
  "sources": "Input JSON strings in load_json_body; data from ExecutionResult and GraphQLError objects; format_error function; optional encode function.",
  "sinks": "json.dumps and json.loads functions for serialization/deserialization; output to ServerResponse.body; usage of eval or exec (not present here).",
  "flows": "Input JSON data -> load_json_body parses into dict/list -> encode_execution_results serializes results to JSON -> ServerResponse body outputs JSON string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard libraries and functions. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution found.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of test functions verifying JSON serialization/deserialization and GraphQL result formatting. No evidence of malicious code or sabotage. Data flows are straightforward, and there are no external data injections or dangerous operations. All data handling appears safe and standard for a testing suite.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, safe test suite for GraphQL server utilities. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks identified. It strictly performs data serialization/deserialization and result formatting checks.",
