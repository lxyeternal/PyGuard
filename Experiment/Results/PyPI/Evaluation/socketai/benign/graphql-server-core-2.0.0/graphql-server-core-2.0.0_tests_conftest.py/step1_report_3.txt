  "purpose": "The code conditionally sets a filename pattern to be ignored during collection based on the Python version.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "collect_ignore_glob variable",
  "flows": "sys.version_info → conditional check → assign to collect_ignore_glob",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; simple version check and variable assignment",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module to access runtime Python version information. It then checks if the major and minor version tuple is less than (3, 4). If so, it sets a list of filename patterns to ignore during collection. This appears to be a version compatibility adjustment, commonly used in test or build scripts. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward, with no external data inputs or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign, version-based configuration setup. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
