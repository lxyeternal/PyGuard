{
  "purpose": "The code is used to conditionally ignore certain test files based on Python version compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads the sys.version_info attribute to determine the Python version.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to a data leak or effect.",
  "flows": "The source (sys.version_info) is used to set a variable (collect_ignore_glob) if the version condition is met.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the sys module to check the Python runtime version. If the version is less than 3.4, it sets a variable to ignore certain test files matching '*_asyncio.py'. This is a common compatibility check for test configurations, not malicious activity. The code is minimal and has no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version check for compatibility purposes, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
