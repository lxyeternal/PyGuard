  "purpose": "Perform a Python version check to conditionally set a variable for compatibility, likely in test or build scripts.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.version_info to determine Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Source (sys.version_info) to conditional assignment of collect_ignore_glob.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple, standard version check using sys.version_info, then sets a variable to ignore certain files if Python version is below 3.4. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code is minimal and purpose-driven, with no external data handling or network activity. All reports correctly identify its benign nature and assign scores accordingly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, compatibility-related version check with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action needed.",
