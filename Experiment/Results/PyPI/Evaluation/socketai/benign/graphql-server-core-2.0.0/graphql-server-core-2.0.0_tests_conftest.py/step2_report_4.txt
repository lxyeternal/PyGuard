  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is a straightforward version check using `sys.version_info` to conditionally set `collect_ignore_glob`. \n   - All reports agree that this is a common pattern used for compatibility, particularly in test configurations.\n   - No reports identify any actual issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is simple, non-obfuscated, and purpose-driven.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the straightforward code.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, which is justified.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any risk, and the code does not demonstrate malicious behavior.\n   - Therefore, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing untrusted data, network activity, or backdoors.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the code's simplicity.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — The code is benign.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk.\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, standard version check used in many projects for compatibility purposes. It does not involve any malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI agree with the provided scores. No adjustments are necessary. The code poses no security threat and is purely functional for version-based configuration.",
