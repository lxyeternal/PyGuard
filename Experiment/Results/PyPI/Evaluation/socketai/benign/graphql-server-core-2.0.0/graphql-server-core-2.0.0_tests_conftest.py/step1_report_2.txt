{
  "purpose": "The code checks the Python version and sets a ignore pattern for certain files if the version is below 3.4.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'sys.version_info' attribute to determine Python version.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow is from reading system information ('sys.version_info') to a conditional branch that sets a variable ('collect_ignore_glob').",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and standard; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'sys' module and performs a version check. If the Python version is less than 3.4, it assigns a list to 'collect_ignore_glob'. This appears to be part of a conditional configuration, likely for test discovery or file ignoring in a testing framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version check and configuration setting with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions as a version-based configuration snippet.",
