{
  "purpose": "The code is used to determine the Python version and set a file ignore pattern if the version is below 3.4.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, which reads the Python interpreter's version information",
  "sinks": "The variable 'collect_ignore_glob' is set based on the version check, but this does not directly lead to any security impact",
  "flows": "sys.version_info → version comparison → conditional assignment to collect_ignore_glob",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior present. The code is straightforward version checking and conditional variable assignment",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module and checks the Python version. If the major and minor version are less than 3.4, it sets the variable 'collect_ignore_glob' to ignore certain files. There are no external data inputs, no data leaks, no dangerous code execution, and no malicious intent detected. The code simply performs a version check to conditionally configure behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard version compatibility handling with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign and purely functional for compatibility purposes.",
