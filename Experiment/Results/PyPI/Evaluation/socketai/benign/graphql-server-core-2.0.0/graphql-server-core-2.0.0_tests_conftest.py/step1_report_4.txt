  "purpose": "The code checks the Python interpreter version and sets a filename pattern to ignore based on the version.",

  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "Reading sys.version_info to determine the Python version",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version check and variable assignment",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module, then checks if the current Python version is less than 3.4. If so, it sets the variable collect_ignore_glob to exclude files matching '*_asyncio.py'. This is a common pattern used in setup or testing scripts to conditionally ignore files based on the environment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity in this snippet. The code is simple and purpose-driven with no external data input, no sensitive information handling, and no network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign version check and sets an ignore pattern accordingly. No malicious or security risks are present.",
