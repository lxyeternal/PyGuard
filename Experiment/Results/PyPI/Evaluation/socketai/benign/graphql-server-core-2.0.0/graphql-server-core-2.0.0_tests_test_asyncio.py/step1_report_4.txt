{
  "purpose": "The code defines a GraphQL schema with several fields, resolvers, and a custom executor for testing async execution.",
  "sources": "Import statements, resolver functions, schema definition, and test function.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe use of asyncio event loop, run_http_query, and Promise.all with untrusted query data.",
  "flows": "User inputs (GraphQL query) pass through run_http_query, invoking resolvers and executor methods, eventually returning data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Use of asyncio event loop is standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a GraphQL schema with both synchronous and asynchronous resolvers, including error-raising functions for testing. It defines a custom AsyncioExecutor that logs method calls. The test function runs a GraphQL query within an asyncio event loop, invoking the schema with a custom executor and collecting results. No indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code, are present. Use of asyncio and promise handling appears standard and confined to local execution context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for testing GraphQL query execution with custom asyncio executor and does not contain malicious or sabotage behaviors. No security risks or malware indications are evident.",
