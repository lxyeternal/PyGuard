  "purpose": "Defines a GraphQL schema with resolvers (including error-raising ones) and a custom executor for testing asynchronous execution flow.",
  "sources": "GraphQL resolvers, run_http_query function, asyncio event loop",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data leaks detected",
  "flows": "Query input flows into resolvers; resolvers return static data or raise errors; custom executor tracks method calls during execution",
  "anomalies": "Use of intentionally raised errors in resolvers for testing; no suspicious or malicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard GraphQL schema with both sync and async resolvers, including error scenarios, and a custom executor subclass that tracks method calls. It runs a test query asynchronously, asserting correct results and executor behavior. No external data, secrets, or network activity is present. The code is well-structured, uses common libraries, and appears solely for testing purposes. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The intentional error raising is typical for testing error handling, not malicious intent. The code does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard GraphQL testing setup with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
