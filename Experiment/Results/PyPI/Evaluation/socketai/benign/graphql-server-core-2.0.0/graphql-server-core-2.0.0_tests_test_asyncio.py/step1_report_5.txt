{
  "purpose": "The code defines a GraphQL schema with asynchronous and synchronous resolvers, and tests the execution of a query using a custom executor.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the GraphQL query string and the event loop; no external untrusted sources are explicitly read within the code.",
  "sinks": "Results are returned as GraphQL responses; no direct data leaks or external system interactions are evident.",
  "flows": "Query string -> run_http_query -> execute resolvers -> collect results -> return data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Custom executor usage appears standard; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a GraphQL schema with resolvers that raise errors or return static strings, with an asynchronous executor class that wraps execution methods. The test function runs a GraphQL query within an asyncio event loop, using a custom executor to control execution flow. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. The code is well-structured, utilizes standard libraries, and does not include suspicious patterns or obfuscated code. It appears to be a typical test setup for GraphQL query execution and executor behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks. It is a controlled test of GraphQL schema execution with custom executor handling. No signs of malware or security vulnerabilities are present.",
