{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a GraphQL schema with resolvers, and tests the execution of queries using a custom asyncio executor.",
  "sources": "Input sources include GraphQL query strings received via run_http_query. No external or untrusted data sources are directly read within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks are evident that process untrusted data; the code mainly executes predefined resolvers and manages query execution flow.",
  "flows": "The flow involves parsing the GraphQL query, executing resolvers (both sync and async), and handling execution via a custom executor. No external data flows or data exfiltration paths are visible.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The custom executor tracks method calls but does not perform malicious actions. The code raises errors intentionally in resolvers, which is standard for testing error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines GraphQL types and resolvers, some intentionally raising errors for testing. It implements a custom executor extending AsyncioExecutor, which tracks method calls. The test function runs a GraphQL query asynchronously, asserting expected results and method call flags. No external data manipulation, insecure code, or obfuscated logic is present. The code appears to be a straightforward test setup for GraphQL execution flow, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup for testing GraphQL query execution with custom executor tracking. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. The code is benign and intended for testing purposes only.",
