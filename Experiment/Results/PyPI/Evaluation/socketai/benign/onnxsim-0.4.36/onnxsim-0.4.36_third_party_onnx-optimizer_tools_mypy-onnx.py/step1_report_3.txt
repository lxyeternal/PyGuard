  "purpose": "Run mypy static type checks on the parent directory of the script.",
  "sources": "os.path.realpath, os.path.dirname, os.path.abspath, subprocess.check_call",
  "shops": "subprocess.check_call calls run 'mypy' on the current directory",
  "flows": "os.path.realpath and os.path.dirname generate a directory path, which is used by subprocess.check_call to execute mypy",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected; straightforward use of subprocess to run static analysis",
  "analysis": "The script determines the root folder relative to its location, switches to that directory, and runs mypy twice: once normally, once with Python 2 compatibility. It handles exceptions to prevent error output clutter. All operations are standard and benign, aimed at type checking; no malicious behavior or obfuscation observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate script for running mypy static type checks on a directory. No signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks are present.",
