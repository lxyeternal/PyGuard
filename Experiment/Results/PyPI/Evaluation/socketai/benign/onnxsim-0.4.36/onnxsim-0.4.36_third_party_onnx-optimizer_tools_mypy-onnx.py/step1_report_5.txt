{
  "purpose": "The script runs mypy static type checks on the project directory, including Python 2 compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "The code reads the file path of the current script to determine the root directory.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.check_call calls execute mypy commands which could potentially run malicious code if mypy or the environment is compromised, but in this context, they are just static analysis tools.",
  "flows": "The code reads its own location, changes directory to the project root, then runs mypy commands; no untrusted input is processed or output handled beyond subprocess calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. The script simply invokes mypy for static analysis; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script determines its root directory, changes into it, and runs two mypy commands to perform static type checking. Error handling captures subprocess errors to prevent backtraces. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or data leaks. Usage of subprocess is straightforward and limited to running external static analysis tools. No untrusted data or network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility script for running static type checks with mypy. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It performs expected actions securely with no evident security risks.",
