  "purpose": "The script is designed to run static type checks on a Python project using mypy, both in Python 3 and Python 2 modes.",
  "sources": "os.path.realpath, os.path.dirname, os.path.abspath, subprocess.check_call",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_call (executes external commands)",
  "flows": "The script constructs the project root path, then executes mypy twice; input data flows from environment and filesystem to subprocess calls",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution; straightforward subprocess invocation",
  "analysis": "The code changes directory to the project's root directory and runs mypy in two modes via subprocess. It handles exceptions gracefully, preventing traceback output. No untrusted input handling or network activity is present. The subprocess calls are for running external static analysis tools, which is standard for code quality checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard static analysis task without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It neither reads untrusted data nor executes any harmful commands. The code appears safe and benign.",
