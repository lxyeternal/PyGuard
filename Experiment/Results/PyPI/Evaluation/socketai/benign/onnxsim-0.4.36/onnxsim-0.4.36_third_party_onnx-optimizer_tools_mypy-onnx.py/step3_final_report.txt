{
  "purpose": "The script determines the project root directory based on its own location, changes to that directory, and runs mypy static type checks twice (once normally, once with --py2).",
  "sources": "Filesystem path resolution via os.path functions.",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess commands ('mypy') with static command strings.",
  "flows": "Path resolution leading to subprocess calls; no untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that sets its working directory to the project root and runs mypy twice for static type checking. It handles subprocess exceptions silently, returning an error code if mypy fails. There is no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The subprocess commands are static and safe. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is benign, intended for development tooling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for static type checking with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or very close) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
