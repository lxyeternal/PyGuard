{
  "purpose": "The script runs type checking on the current project directory using mypy, both in Python 3 and Python 2 modes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the script's own file path (__file__), resolves directories, and executes external commands ('mypy') via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess calls execute external commands which could be exploited if the command or arguments are manipulated, but here they are static.",
  "flows": "The script derives the root directory path from its own location and then runs 'mypy' commands in that directory; no untrusted data is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; straightforward directory resolution and subprocess calls.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the project root directory relative to its own location, then changes to that directory. It runs 'mypy' twice: once in default mode and once with '--py2'. It handles subprocess exceptions silently, returning exit codes accordingly. There are no user inputs, no data leaks, and no suspicious behaviors. The subprocess calls are static and safe. The overall structure is simple and direct, with no obfuscation or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple script to perform static type checks with mypy on a project directory, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a legitimate utility script.",
