{
  "purpose": "This script runs mypy static type checks on the project directory and its Python 2 compatibility version.",
  "sources": "The script reads the current script's location, resolves paths, and executes mypy commands via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess calls execute mypy commands which could potentially process untrusted code, but in this context, they are just static analysis tools.",
  "flows": "The script determines the root directory, then invokes mypy checks, with no direct untrusted data flows or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation. The subprocess calls are standard for running external commands.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the project root directory based on its location, then runs static type checking using mypy for both Python 3 and Python 2 compatibility. It catches exceptions from subprocess calls to prevent error backtraces, merely exiting with a status code. No data leaks, malicious behaviors, or suspicious activities are present. The logic is straightforward, intended for development tooling, with no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a standard static analysis invocation with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script for type checking during development.",
