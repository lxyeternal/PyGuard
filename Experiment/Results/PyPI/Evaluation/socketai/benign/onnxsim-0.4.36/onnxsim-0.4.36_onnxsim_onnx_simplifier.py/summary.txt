  "conclusion": "The code is primarily legitimate for ONNX model processing, with the main concern being the subprocess-based dependency installation, which could be exploited in a compromised environment. No active malicious code or obfuscation is detected. The supply chain risk should be acknowledged, but the code itself is not malicious."
