No active malicious code or obfuscation is detected. The supply chain risk should be acknowledged, but the code itself is not malicious."

The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) reflects typical risks associated with build scripts relying on external tools and environment variables but does not indicate any malicious intent."

The reliance on external C++ libraries is typical for such performance-critical tasks. Temporary file handling is standard, and no suspicious activity is evident. Overall, the component is secure and trustworthy assuming external dependencies are from reputable sources."
