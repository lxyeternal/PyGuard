  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured testing suite for exporting and simplifying ONNX models from PyTorch. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose."
