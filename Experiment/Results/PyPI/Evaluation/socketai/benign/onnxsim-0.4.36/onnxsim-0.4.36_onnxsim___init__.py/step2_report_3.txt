  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the scores and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code imports modules from `onnxsim.onnx_simplifier` and related packages.\n- It creates an instance of `PyModelExecutor` and registers it via `_set_model_executor`.\n- The use of private/internal methods (`_set_model_executor`) is consistent but not inherently malicious.\n- No external data, network activity, or data leakage is evident.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The code appears to be a configuration/setup for ONNX model simplification.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- Use of internal/private API `_set_model_executor` is unconventional but not malicious.\n- No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- Reliance on internal/private API functions (`_set_model_executor`) could cause maintenance issues if APIs change, but this is not a security flaw.\n- No vulnerabilities or logic errors are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2; given the code's nature, this seems reasonable, as it involves internal API usage but no malicious activity.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- The use of internal methods could pose compatibility or stability risks but not security risks.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code content.\n- The reasoning that this is standard setup code with no malicious intent holds.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (low, due to internal API use, but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports correctly identify the use of internal functions as a potential concern but not a security issue.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is cautious and justified.\n- The overall conclusion aligns: this code is a legitimate setup for ONNX model processing with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                | No malicious code, payload, or suspicious activity present.|\n| Obfuscated     | 0                | Clear, straightforward code.                                |\n| Risk           | 0.1              | Slight concern over internal API use but not security-related.|\n\nPlease proceed with this assessment or let me know if further analysis is needed.",
