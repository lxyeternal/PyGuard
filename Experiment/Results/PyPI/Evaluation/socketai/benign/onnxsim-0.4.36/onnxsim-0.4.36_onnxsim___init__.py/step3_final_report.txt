  "purpose": "Setup and register a custom ONNX model executor using internal API functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, creation of PyModelExecutor instance, internal method _set_model_executor",
  "sinks": "Internal API call _set_model_executor, no external data or network activity",
  "flows": "Import modules -> instantiate PyModelExecutor -> call _set_model_executor with executor instance",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal/private method _set_model_executor; no obfuscation or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, creates an executor object, and registers it via an internal API. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The use of internal functions is unconventional but not malicious. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's straightforward nature. The internal API usage could pose maintenance risks but does not impact security. Overall, the code is a benign configuration snippet with minimal security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for ONNX model processing, with no malicious intent or activity. The use of internal API functions warrants caution for maintenance but does not constitute a security threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2).",
