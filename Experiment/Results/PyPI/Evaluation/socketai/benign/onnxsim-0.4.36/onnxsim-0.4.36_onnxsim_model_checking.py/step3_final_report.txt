  "purpose": "A utility for comparing ONNX models by generating or using provided inputs, running inference via onnxruntime, and checking for output discrepancies.",
  "sources": "Reads models, optional custom library file, generates random input data or uses supplied data.",
  "sinks": "No external network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Model loading -> input generation -> inference execution -> output comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Custom library is checked for existence before registration, mitigating risk.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard model comparison tasks securely using well-known libraries. It handles external files carefully, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The optional custom library parameter is managed securely by verifying file existence before registration. No network activity, data leaks, or code injections are present. The logic is straightforward, and the code adheres to best practices for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for ONNX model validation with no malicious or suspicious elements. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the optional custom library handling, which is managed securely. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the overall risk score is very low (~0.1).",
