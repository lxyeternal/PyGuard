  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for ONNX model validation with no malicious or suspicious elements. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the optional custom library handling, which is managed securely. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the overall risk score is very low (~0.1)."
