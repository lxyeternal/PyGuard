{
  "purpose": "The code is designed as a setup script for building and installing the onnxoptimizer Python package, including custom build commands and integration with CMake.",
  "sources": "Sources include environment variables (e.g., CMAKE_ARGS, MAX_JOBS, environment variables for build options), subprocess outputs (git revision), and filesystem reads (VERSION_NUMBER, version.py, README.md).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve subprocess calls (subprocess.check_output, subprocess.check_call), file writes (creating version.py), environment variable parsing, and command-line execution (mypy type checker).",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables into build commands and subprocess executions; version info from files into generated Python files; command-line arguments into subprocess calls for build and type checking.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior detected. The script appears to be a standard build setup with environment variable controls, subprocess calls, and filesystem operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for building a package with custom commands, using environment variables for build options, and invoking CMake for compilation. It reads version info from files and git, and integrates with setuptools for package management. All subprocess calls are related to build automation, and no external network or data exfiltration code is found. No obfuscation or malicious patterns identified. The use of subprocess and environment variables is typical for build scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build setup for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs environment-aware build automation and versioning, with no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration. Overall, it appears safe.",
