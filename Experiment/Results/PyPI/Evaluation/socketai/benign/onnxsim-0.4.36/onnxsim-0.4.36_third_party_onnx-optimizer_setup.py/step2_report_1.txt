  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a build script that uses subprocess to invoke 'git' and 'cmake', reads version info from files, and manipulates environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External subprocess calls, file writes, environment variable influence.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of subprocess to call external tools like 'git' and 'cmake' is typical in build scripts; no suspicious commands or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis:** Standard build automation code, no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The subprocess calls are typical and controlled within the build context.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate build script. No malware, no obfuscation, minimal security risk.\n\n**Score justifications:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, typical build process)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on build configuration, environment variables, subprocess calls.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Same pattern—external commands, version files, environment variables.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, secrets, or backdoors. Use of subprocess is standard.\n- **Analysis:** Typical build script, no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, a build setup involving environment variables, subprocess calls, and version info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External subprocesses, file writes, environment variables.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or secrets. Standard build process.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, just a typical setup script.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar build automation with subprocesses, environment variables, and version files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External commands, file operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or secrets.\n- **Analysis:** Standard build script, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—build setup, version info, environment variables, subprocess calls.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External tools, file writes.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Typical build script, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe a standard build setup script for a Python package with C++ extensions, heavily reliant on subprocess calls to external tools ('git', 'cmake') and environment variables for configuration.\n- **Malware assessment:** No evidence of malicious code, network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard practices.\n- **Supply chain risk:** While subprocess calls could be exploited if environment variables or external tools are compromised, there is no direct indication of malicious intent or malicious payloads in the code itself.\n\n### **Estimated scores based on the analysis:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (low, typical build process, no significant security concern)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile build scripts inherently involve subprocess calls to external tools, which could be a vector if those tools are compromised, the code as presented is standard, transparent, and free from malicious patterns. Continuous security practices should include verifying external tools and environment integrity, but based solely on this code review, it is safe.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2",
