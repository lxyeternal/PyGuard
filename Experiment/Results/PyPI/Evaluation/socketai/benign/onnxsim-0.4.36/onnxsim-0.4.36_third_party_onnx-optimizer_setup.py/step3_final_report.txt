  "purpose": "Build and setup automation for the 'onnxoptimizer' Python package, involving version management, CMake build configuration, and extension compilation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, subprocess calls to 'git' and 'cmake', version files, and file system operations.",
  "sinks": "External subprocess executions, file writes for version info, environment variable influences on build configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence subprocess commands and build parameters; subprocess calls invoke external build tools; version info is written to files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious commands, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; subprocess usage is standard for build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical build setup script for a Python package with C++ extensions, utilizing subprocess to invoke external tools ('git', 'cmake') and environment variables for configuration. No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation is evident. The subprocess calls are controlled and standard for build automation. The environment variables are used for configuration purposes only, with no signs of malicious payloads or backdoors. The code structure is clear, and the logic straightforward, indicating a legitimate build process.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard build and setup utility for the 'onnxoptimizer' package. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) reflects typical risks associated with build scripts relying on external tools and environment variables but does not indicate any malicious intent.",
