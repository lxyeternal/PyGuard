  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard build setup for 'onnxoptimizer', involving subprocess calls to 'git' and 'cmake', environment variables, and version file generation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Subprocess calls are typical for build scripts.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** The report assigns a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. The overall security risk is low (~0.2), given the standard nature of the script.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears safe and legitimate.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on build configuration, environment variables, subprocess calls, and versioning.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The subprocess usage is typical.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is justified; no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and standard build script.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on build automation, version info, and environment variables, with subprocess calls for 'git' and 'cmake'.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malicious code or obfuscation observed. The subprocess calls are standard.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate build setup.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with subprocess calls, environment variables, and build management.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation. Uses common build practices.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard build script.\n\n**Recommendation:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes a typical build setup involving external tools, environment variables, and version info.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Malware score of 0, as expected.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate build process.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, standard build script.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above 0.1 in some reports, but justified given the reliance on subprocess calls and environment variables. These are typical in build scripts and do not indicate security risks.\n\n### My final estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 for all, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting the inherent risks of subprocess calls and environment variable manipulation, but nothing malicious.\n\n**In conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured build setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores across reports are reasonable and consistent with the content.",
