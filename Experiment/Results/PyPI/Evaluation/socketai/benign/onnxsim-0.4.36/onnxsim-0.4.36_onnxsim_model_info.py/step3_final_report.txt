{
  "purpose": "Analyze ONNX models to extract operation counts and size, and visualize comparison between original and optimized models.",
  "sources": "Model graph nodes, attributes, initializers, and nested subgraphs.",
  "sinks": "None; purely in-memory processing with no external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Graph nodes and attributes are traversed to accumulate operation counts and model size; data flows within model structure only.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and performs expected analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code recursively traverses ONNX model graphs, counting operation types and summing model size, including nested subgraphs. It then visualizes the comparison between original and optimized models using rich tables, highlighting size differences. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code relies on standard libraries and performs safe, in-memory data processing. Minor note: the security risk score in one report is slightly overestimated at 0.1; given the benign nature, it should be adjusted to 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for ONNX model analysis and visualization. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the security posture is very low. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a minor adjustment to the security risk score in report 2 from 0.1 to 0 for consistency.",
