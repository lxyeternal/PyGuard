  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for extracting and displaying information about ONNX models, such as operation counts and model size, for comparison purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from ONNX model objects, specifically the model graph, initializers, and attributes. No external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Uses rich library functions for printing formatted tables and text. No sinks that lead to data leaks, network communication, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from ONNX model objects to internal data structures, then to formatted console output via rich. No untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard ONNX and rich library functions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. No dynamic code execution or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations: it traverses ONNX graph nodes, counts operation types, sums model size, and displays the data in a formatted table. It uses common Python libraries and techniques. No signs of malicious intent, malicious data handling, or sabotage are present. The purpose appears to be model analysis and comparison, with clear, straightforward logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for model analysis and visualization. It does not contain any malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It is safe and purely informational.",
