  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for ONNX model analysis and visualization. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the security posture is very low. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a minor adjustment to the security risk score in report 2 from 0.1 to 0 for consistency."
