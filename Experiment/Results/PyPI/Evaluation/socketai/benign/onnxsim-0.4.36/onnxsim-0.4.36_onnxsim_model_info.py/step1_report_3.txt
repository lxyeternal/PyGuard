{
  "purpose": "The code analyzes and displays information about ONNX models, including operator counts and model sizes, and compares original and optimized models.",
  "sources": "Imports external libraries (onnx, rich) for model analysis and visualization; reads ONNX model data via the onnx.ModelProto and onnx.GraphProto objects.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or transmits untrusted data; it primarily reads model data and displays output locally.",
  "flows": "Reads model data from onnx.ModelProto and onnx.GraphProto objects; processes graph nodes and attributes to compute statistics; outputs formatted tables to console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs standard model analysis and visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically traverses ONNX model graphs to gather operator counts and size metrics. It uses standard libraries and methods without executing external or dynamic code. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The use of rich library is solely for printing formatted tables. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The functions operate on model data structures to produce analysis output. Overall, the code appears safe, well-structured, and intended for model analysis purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate model analysis and comparison tasks without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not include network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No malicious behavior or malicious code patterns are detected.",
