{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to analyze ONNX models, extract structural information such as operation counts and model size, and compare original and optimized models visually using a table.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the ONNX model objects passed to the functions, specifically the model.graph and associated attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks in the traditional sense; the code does not write untrusted data to external systems or files, nor does it execute or process external commands or network communications.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the ONNX model inputs through internal processing in get_info() (traversing nodes and attributes) to generate summaries used in print_simplifying_info(), with no external data or command execution involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code mainly processes data structures and outputs formatted tables.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and third-party libraries, defines utility functions, and contains classes/methods for analyzing ONNX models. It traverses model graphs to count operations and compute size, then outputs comparative tables. There is no evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, network activity, or malicious payloads. Usage of external libraries like 'onnx' and 'rich' appears legitimate for visualization and model analysis purposes. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for analyzing and visualizing ONNX model information, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe based on the provided content.",
