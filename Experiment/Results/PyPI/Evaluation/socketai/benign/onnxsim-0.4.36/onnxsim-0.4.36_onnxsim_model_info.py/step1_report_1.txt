{
  "purpose": "This code analyzes ONNX models to extract information such as the number of operations and model size, and provides a visual comparison between original and simplified models.",
  "sources": "Reads ONNX model protobuf objects (model and model_opt), accesses model.graph, nodes, attributes, initializers, and ByteSize() method.",
  "sinks": "Outputs visual table via rich.print, no data being sent to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model inputs through get_info() extracting node info and sizes, then to print_simplifying_info() which visualizes the comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code observed. Uses standard ONNX and rich library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it defines a class to gather model operation counts and size, and a function to print a comparative table of original and optimized models. It uses standard libraries for protobuf handling and rich for visualization. No suspicious data flows, external communications, or hidden behaviors are present. The only potentially notable aspect is the use of rich.print for output, but this is typical for formatted console output and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for ONNX model analysis and visualization, with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It adheres to standard practices and library usage without any suspicious patterns.",
