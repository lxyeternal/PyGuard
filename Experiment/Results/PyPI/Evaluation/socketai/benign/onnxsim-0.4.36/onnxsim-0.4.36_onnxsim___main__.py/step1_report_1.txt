{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'main' and executes its main function if the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "The 'import main' statement which loads an external module; the '__name__' variable used to determine execution context.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()' which executes code from the imported module if run directly.",
  "flows": "Import 'main' -> check if __name__ == '__main__' -> execute main() if true.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a local module named 'main' and executes its 'main()' function when the script is run as the main program. No input/output, no dynamic code execution, and no hidden behaviors are present. The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python scripts meant to invoke a main procedure.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard entry point pattern in Python, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on this minimal code snippet.",
