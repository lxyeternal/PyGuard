{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point to execute the 'main' module or function when the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __name__ variable and imports the 'main' module.",
  "sinks": "The code calls main(), which could execute arbitrary code depending on the implementation of the main module.",
  "flows": "The __name__ check triggers the execution of main() if the script is run directly.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for Python scripts; no hardcoded secrets, unusual constructs, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "This code imports a local module 'main' and executes its main() function when run as a script. There are no suspicious or malicious elements visible; it appears to be a typical script entry point. No external data is read directly in this snippet, and there are no indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python script entry point with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply delegates execution to the main() function of a local module.",
