  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point to execute a main function from a local module.",
  "sources": "The import statement from . import main",
  "sinks": "The call to main() in the __main__ block",
  "flows": "Import main -> execute main() if run as script",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for Python scripts",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module named main and invokes its main() function if the script is run directly. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs, no hardcoded credentials, no network calls, and no obfuscated code. The structure is typical for Python scripts designed as entry points. The code itself does not perform any operations beyond calling main().",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard script entry point with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
