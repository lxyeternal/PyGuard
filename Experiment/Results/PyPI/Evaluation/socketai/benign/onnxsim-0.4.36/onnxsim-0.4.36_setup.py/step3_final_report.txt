{
  "purpose": "The script orchestrates the build and packaging process for a Python project involving native extensions built with CMake. It manages versioning, configuration, and compilation steps.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from git commands or version files; reads environment variables for build configuration; executes external commands ('git', 'cmake', 'make') via subprocess; reads and writes files; accesses filesystem for directory creation and file copying.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to external build tools; file read/write operations; environment variable evaluations influencing build parameters.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence subprocess command arguments; subprocess commands invoke versioning and build steps; files are read for version info and written for version definitions; build directories are created and files copied as part of build process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity detected. Use of environment variables for build configuration is standard but could be misused if environment variables are maliciously set.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard build orchestration script for a Python package with native extensions. It retrieves version info from git or fallback files, configures build parameters based on environment variables, and executes external build tools ('git', 'cmake', 'make'). The subprocess calls are typical for such build scripts, and no suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The use of environment variables introduces potential risk if manipulated, but this is common in build environments. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are found. The code structure and commands are straightforward and align with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build and packaging tool with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports—malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, risk score approximately 0.2—are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. Overall, the code is safe, transparent, and intended solely for build orchestration.",
