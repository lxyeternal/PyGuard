  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious activity, correctness of scoring, and consistency with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The script orchestrates building a Python package with native extensions via CMake.\n- It reads version info from git or fallback files.\n- It constructs build commands dynamically based on environment variables.\n- It executes external tools (`git`, `cmake`, `make`) via subprocess.\n- It performs filesystem operations like creating directories, copying files.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.\n- The logic is typical for build scripts, with some potential for misuse if environment variables are maliciously set.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard build orchestration.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; subprocess calls are typical; environment variables could be misused but that's common in build scripts.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — low, due to reliance on environment variables.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Defines setup and build procedures, including custom build commands.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; subprocess calls are standard; environment variables are used for configuration.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minimal.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Configures build process, versioning, and package setup.\n- **Analysis:** Standard build script; no signs of malicious activity; subprocess calls are for version info and build commands.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Build setup for a package with native extensions.\n- **Analysis:** Typical build orchestration; no malicious code or secrets; subprocess calls are for versioning and building.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Build and package configuration with CMake.\n- **Analysis:** Uses environment variables and subprocess calls for build, which is standard; no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the code. No malware, backdoors, or malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting the inherent risks of environment-variable manipulation and subprocess execution in build scripts, but these are standard and not malicious.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — typical for build scripts relying on environment variables and external tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\nThe code is a standard build orchestration script for a Python package involving native code compilation via CMake. It dynamically constructs build commands based on environment variables, which is common practice. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity are present. The subprocess calls are for legitimate build and versioning purposes.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the scores assigned in the reports.** They are reasonable and reflect the actual code behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type | Final Estimate |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| Malware      | 0              |\n| Obfuscated   | 0              |\n| Risk         | 0.2            |\n\n**Note:** The slight risk reflects the potential misuse if environment variables are maliciously set, but this is a known and accepted risk in build scripts, not an indication of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate build setup script with no malicious activity. The scores in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
