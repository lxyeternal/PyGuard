  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The script orchestrates build processes, invoking external tools ('git', 'cmake') and reading version info from files. No suspicious or malicious sources are detected.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Subprocess commands and file operations are standard for build scripts. Environment variables influence build configuration but do not execute malicious code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The subprocess calls are typical and controlled.\n- **Conclusion:** The script is a standard build orchestrator with no malicious intent.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, due to reliance on environment variables and external tools, but no malicious activity)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing build setup, versioning, and configuration via environment variables and subprocess calls.\n- No suspicious code, secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- Standard build script behavior.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, typical build process)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on build configuration, version info retrieval, and environment-based build options.\n- No signs of malicious activity; subprocess calls are standard.\n- Uses environment variables for build customization, which is common.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, inherent to build scripts)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar analysis: build setup, versioning, environment variable influence, subprocess calls.\n- No malicious behavior or suspicious activity detected.\n- The script aligns with typical build procedures.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Details a complex build process involving environment variables, subprocess calls, and file operations.\n- No signs of malicious activity, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- Standard practices for building native extensions with CMake.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- **Environment Variables & External Commands:** While they could be manipulated, this is typical for build scripts and not inherently malicious.\n- **External Calls:** Invoking 'git', 'cmake', and 'make' are standard in build processes.\n- **Secrets & Credentials:** None found.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Malware:** No indicators.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (No malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (Code is clear and standard)\n- **Risk Score:** Given the reliance on environment variables and external commands, a slightly higher score could be justified, but since there's no malicious intent, **0.2** remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to potential misuse of environment variables in build processes, but no actual malicious activity)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate build and packaging script, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The overall security posture is very safe, with minimal inherent risk typical of build scripts.",
