{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup and build procedures for the 'onnxsim' Python package, including custom build commands utilizing CMake and environment configurations.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (e.g., 'CMAKE_ARGS', 'ONNXSIM_SDIST', 'MAX_JOBS'), subprocess calls to 'git' for version info, and reading files such as 'VERSION' and 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to 'git', 'cmake', and 'make' commands; reading files; environment variable evaluations; and file system modifications for build artifacts.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence build configuration and subprocess commands; subprocess outputs are used to determine version info; file I/O reads version and readme content; subprocesses execute build commands based on these inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected; build process relies on external tools and environment variables but no suspicious logic is present; no data exfiltration or malicious network activity evident.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly orchestrates a build process for a Python package with custom build commands. It reads version info from 'git' or fallback files, configures CMake build parameters based on environment variables, and executes build commands via subprocess. The environment variable checks and subprocess calls are standard in build scripts. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as data theft, network exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to function solely as a build setup with no suspicious activity or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build setup script for a Python package with custom build commands. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. All operations relate to package build configuration and execution. Confidence is high that this code is benign.",
