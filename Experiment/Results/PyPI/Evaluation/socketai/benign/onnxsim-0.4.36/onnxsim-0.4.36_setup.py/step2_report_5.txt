  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as orchestrating build processes, version info retrieval via git, file reads, and environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Subprocess calls to 'git', 'cmake', and 'make' are standard for build scripts. File operations are typical.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, just environment-variable-driven configuration. Subprocess calls are safe in the context of build orchestration.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected. The risk score is 0.2, which seems reasonable given the environment-variable-driven configuration.\n\n**Score suggestion:** The overall assessment is sound. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is low. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly notes the script's role in build configuration, versioning, and environment variable usage.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard subprocess calls, no suspicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets or malicious code, just build orchestration.\n- **Conclusion:** Again, no malicious activity, malware, or backdoors.\n\n**Score suggestion:** The scores align with the code's purpose. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the build process, version info retrieval, and environment variable usage.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard subprocess execution, no suspicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, typical build script.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the build orchestration, versioning, and environment variable influence.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard subprocess calls, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious intent, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a standard build setup.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes the build process, environment variables, subprocess calls, and versioning.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard subprocess execution, no suspicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate build script, no malware.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Appropriate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard build orchestration script.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The use of environment variables and subprocess calls is typical for build scripts.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the inherent risks of environment-variable-driven build configuration but no malicious intent.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports — justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is reasonable, considering the potential misuse of environment variables, but overall, the script is benign.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, well-structured build script with no malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
