{
  "purpose": "The code defines a large dictionary named 'vocab_sizes' mapping language codes to sets of integer values representing vocabulary sizes.",
  "sources": "The data is hardcoded within the script as a static dictionary initialization; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external outputs, network operations, or untrusted data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "Since the data is static, there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The data is assigned directly as a constant structure.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a large static dictionary with sets of integers. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or unusual code constructs are present. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a static mapping of language codes to their associated vocabulary sizes as sets of integers. The structure appears consistent, with repeated patterns of language codes mapped to sets containing numeric values. The data might be used for language processing or validation, but there is no evidence of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden code. The content is purely declarative data, and the format is straightforward. No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious behavior are detected. The code’s purpose appears to be configuration or data definition, with no active or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign static data structure defining vocabulary sizes per language code. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are present. The content is purely declarative, with no signs of malicious intent.",
