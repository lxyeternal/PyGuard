{
  "purpose": "Define a dictionary named 'vocab_sizes' containing language codes as keys and sets of integer vocabulary sizes as values.",
  "sources": "The dictionary 'vocab_sizes' is a static data structure initialized directly in the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data inputs or outputs, nor any data being sent over a network or written to files.",
  "flows": "The data is a static in-memory structure; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The data appears to be a large static mapping of language codes to sets of integers without any obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden logic. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a Python dictionary with nested sets of integers. The structure is consistent and appears to represent language codes with associated vocabulary sizes. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is detected. The data seems to be for language or NLP-related configuration purposes. There are no functions, external interactions, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and static, with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration dictionary defining language codes and associated vocabulary sizes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, backdoors, or malicious logic. It appears to be a benign dataset for application use.",
