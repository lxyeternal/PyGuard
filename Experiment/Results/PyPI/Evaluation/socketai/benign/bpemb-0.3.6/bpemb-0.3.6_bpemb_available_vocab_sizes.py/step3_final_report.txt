{
  "purpose": "Static dictionary mapping language codes to sets of vocabulary sizes, likely used for language processing configuration.",
  "sources": "Code reads from a large, hardcoded dictionary with nested sets of integers.",
  "sinks": "No external data input/output; static data only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources; static data remains within the code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'dummy' key with an empty dictionary, likely a placeholder; no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, large dictionary declaration with nested sets of integers. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing occurs. The 'dummy' key with an empty dict is an anomaly but not malicious. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns are detected. All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, reflecting the benign, configuration-like nature of the data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static dataset used for language configuration. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The 'dummy' key is likely a placeholder and not malicious. The overall security assessment is that the code is safe.",
