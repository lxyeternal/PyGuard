{
  "purpose": "Definition of a dictionary containing language codes as keys and associated vocab size sets as values.",
  "sources": "The entire code itself, which declares a large nested dictionary structure.",
  "sinks": "None; no input/output or data processing functions present that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs, as this is static data declaration without any processing or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an empty dictionary for the key 'dummy' which may be a placeholder but does not pose malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of a large dictionary initialization with nested sets of integers for language codes. No dynamic execution, data manipulation, network access, or other behaviors typical of malicious code. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or external data sources. The structure appears to be static configuration data, potentially for language processing or similar applications. No signs of malware or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static data structure declaration containing language-related vocab size sets. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It appears safe and purely informational.",
