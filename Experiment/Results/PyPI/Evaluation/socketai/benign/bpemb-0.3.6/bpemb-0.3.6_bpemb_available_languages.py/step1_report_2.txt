  "purpose": "Define sets of Wikicode language codes and their mappings between different standards.",
  "sources": "Dictionary literals at the beginning, variable assignments, and multiple dictionary definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; code only assigns and defines data structures without executing untrusted input or writing output.",
  "flows": "Data is static; there are no flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. The data appears to be static mappings of language codes, with no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external data fetching.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of defining sets and dictionaries for language code mappings. No user input, network activity, or file I/O is present. The structure and content are static, well-formed, and typical for configuration data. No signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely data definition for language code mappings, with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected. It appears to be benign configuration data.",
