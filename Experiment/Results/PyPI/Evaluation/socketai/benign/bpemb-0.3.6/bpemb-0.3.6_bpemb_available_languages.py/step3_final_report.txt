  "purpose": "Static data definitions of language code mappings, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The code contains only static dictionaries and sets defining language codes and their abbreviations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input/output, network activity, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A – static data, no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, defining language code mappings with extensive entries and some redundancies. No dynamic execution, input/output, network activity, or obfuscation is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low or zero security risk scores. The slight increase in risk score (0.1) in one report reflects data volume and redundancy but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall structure and content are straightforward and consistent with benign static data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
