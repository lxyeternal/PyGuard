{
  "purpose": "The code defines two dictionaries mapping language codes and their abbreviations, likely used for language identification or translation functionalities.",
  "sources": "The dictionaries are hardcoded within the source code; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or output functions are present; no data is transmitted or stored externally.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or data processing pipelines are evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The data appears to be static mappings for language codes. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or misleading variable usage is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static dictionary definitions mapping language abbreviations and codes, with no functions, input handling, or output operations. All data is hardcoded, which is typical for lookup tables. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The data could be used legitimately in language processing applications. No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static data structure used for language code mappings. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
