{
  "purpose": "This code defines two dictionaries mapping language codes to their standard abbreviations and vice versa, likely for language translation or processing features.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded string literals defining language code mappings.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data; the code does not perform input/output operations, network communication, or data storage.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the dictionaries are statically initialized and do not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive hardcoded mappings for a wide range of language codes, including some duplicates and overlapping entries. No encryption, obfuscation, or suspicious language features are present. The large volume of data appears static and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, establishing two mappings between language identifiers and their abbreviations. It does not include any functions, dynamic execution, or data handling logic. The large data structures could be unwieldy but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code patterns are observed. The data appears to be a comprehensive language code mapping, potentially used for internationalization purposes. There is no evidence of code injection, backdoors, or sabotage. The duplication of some entries (e.g., 'ang' for Old English, 'nrm' for Norman, etc.) suggests redundancy but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static data declaration of language code mappings with no malicious behavior detected. It is benign and intended for language processing tasks. No signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks are present.",
