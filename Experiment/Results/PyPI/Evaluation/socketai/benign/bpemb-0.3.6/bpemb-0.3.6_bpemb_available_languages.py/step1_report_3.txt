{
  "purpose": "The code defines two dictionaries for language codes and their mappings, likely used for language identification or conversion.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded dictionaries within the script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or external outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code merely initializes static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "The dictionaries contain extensive language code mappings, including some with duplicate or similar entries. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden logic detected. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static dictionary definitions mapping language codes to their abbreviations and names. It does not perform any input/output operations, network communication, or data manipulation. The content appears to be normal data initialization for language processing purposes. No malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, data exfiltration, or sabotage is evident. The code is straightforward and unremarkable in structure, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as static data for language code mappings. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this fragment.",
