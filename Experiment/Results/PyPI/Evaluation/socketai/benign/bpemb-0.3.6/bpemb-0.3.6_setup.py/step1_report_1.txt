  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'bpemb', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is sent or processed in a way that could cause leakage or effect.",
  "flows": "Read from 'README.md' file; dependencies listed in 'install_requires'. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a markdown file for description and sets up package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are typical for package distribution and involve no external data input handling or suspicious code paths. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It merely specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
