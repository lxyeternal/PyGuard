  "flows": "Reading README.md -> Setting up package parameters -> Installing dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. Usage of standard setup tools and common dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file for long description, then calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All dependencies are standard Python packages and do not involve dynamic code execution. No untrusted input handling or network activity is present in this script. No suspicious behavior or malicious code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
