  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a standard `setup.py` script using `setuptools`.\n   - It reads `README.md` for the long description.\n   - It defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n   \n   **Conclusion:** The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or security-risk behaviors.\n\n2. **Assessment of Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the script is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n   - They identify no anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or potential vulnerabilities.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), and no anomalies or malware are detected.\n   - The analysis in each report aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, as the script does not perform any risky operations.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No suspicious activity, external data flows, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The dependencies are standard packages, with no indication of malicious payloads.\n   - The reports' conclusions and scores are consistent with the code.\n\n5. **Final Expert Judgment:**\n   - The code is a typical, benign setup script.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Final recommendation:** The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code is safe and standard for package distribution.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future updates or additional code that might be introduced into the package, but based on the current content, it is secure.",
