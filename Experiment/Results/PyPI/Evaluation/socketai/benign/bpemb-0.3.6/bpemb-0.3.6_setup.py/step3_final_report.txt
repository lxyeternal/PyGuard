{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, static package metadata, dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or external data outputs; static setup process.",
  "flows": "Reading static README file -> passing static metadata and dependencies to setup() -> package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward 'setup.py' script that reads a README file and calls setuptools.setup() with package info. No dynamic or network activity, no obfuscation, and dependencies are standard. All reports correctly identify it as benign with no malicious or security concerns. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
