  "purpose": "Utility functions for loading models, downloading files, and handling archives in NLP workflows.",
  "sources": "HTTP requests for file downloads, file system for saving and extracting files, model files in various formats.",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded chunks to temporary files, extracting archive contents, loading models into memory.",
  "flows": "HTTP response data flows from network to temporary files, then to final storage or model loading; archive extraction reads from temp files to filesystem.",
  "anomalies": "SSL verification disabled (`verify=False`), archive extraction without validation, suppression of SSL warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard utility functions with no obfuscated or malicious code. The primary security concern is disabling SSL verification, which exposes the process to man-in-the-middle attacks if untrusted URLs are used. Archive extraction is performed without validation, which could be exploited with malicious archives, but the code itself does not contain malicious payloads or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's structure is straightforward, and the functions are typical for model and data handling in NLP pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for model and data management tasks. The main security issue is the insecure SSL handling and unvalidated archive extraction, which could be exploited but do not constitute malicious activity. No obfuscation or malware is detected. The security risk score of 0.3 appropriately reflects these concerns.",
