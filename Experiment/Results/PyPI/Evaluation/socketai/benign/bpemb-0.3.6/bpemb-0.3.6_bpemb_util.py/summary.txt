  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for model and data management tasks. The main security issue is the insecure SSL handling and unvalidated archive extraction, which could be exploited but do not constitute malicious activity. No obfuscation or malware is detected. The security risk score of 0.3 appropriately reflects these concerns."
