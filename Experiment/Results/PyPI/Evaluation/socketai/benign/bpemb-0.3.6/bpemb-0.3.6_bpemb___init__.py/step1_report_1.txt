  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows observed; this is only an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple import statement without additional code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import of a class from a local module. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious code. It does not interact with external data or perform any actions that could compromise security. As it only imports a class, the risk is minimal. No additional context suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement for a local module, with no signs of malware or security issues. It appears to be a standard import used in NLP applications.",
