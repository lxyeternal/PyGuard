  "purpose": "Import the BPEmb class from the local bpemb module.",
  "sources": "Import statement accessing a local module named 'bpemb'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks; no external data or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed; only a module import is present.",
  "anomalies": "Only a single import statement; no anomalies or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement, importing BPEmb from a local module. There are no functions, data processing, or external communication. This is a standard import statement typical in Python codebases. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues present in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement of a local module component, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears benign and typical for Python projects.",
