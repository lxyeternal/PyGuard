{
  "purpose": "Import the function 'open_bed' from an internal module '_open_bed' within the 'bed_reader' package, likely for reading BED files in bioinformatics workflows.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no additional data sources are involved in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present; the import simply makes a function available for use elsewhere in the code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a private module ('_open_bed') is somewhat unconventional but not suspicious or malicious; no obfuscation or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from an internal module, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there is no malicious activity. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the internal module import but not indicating any threat. Confidence in this assessment is high (above 0.8). The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign interpretation. No suspicious signals, code injection, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This import statement is benign and typical for internal package usage. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
