{
  "purpose": "Importing the open_bed function from the bed_reader._open_bed module, likely for reading BED files in genomic data processing.",
  "sources": "The import statement sourcing the open_bed function from an internal module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present in this line.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible from a single import statement; potential flow depends on usage elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The import path appears to access an internal module (_open_bed), which is often intended for internal use, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports a specific function from a module. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code execution, or backdoors. The use of a leading underscore suggests internal module use, which is common and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are visible in this import statement alone.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no indications of malicious activity or security risks. It is a typical import for genomic data handling with no suspicious behavior observed.",
