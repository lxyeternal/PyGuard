  "purpose": "Import the 'open_bed' function from the '_open_bed' module within the 'bed_reader' package, likely for processing BED files in bioinformatics.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'open_bed' from 'bed_reader._open_bed'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable, as this is a simple import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The import appears standard and straightforward. No obfuscated or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific function 'open_bed' from a submodule '_open_bed' within the 'bed_reader' package. The import statement is simple, with no dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious data handling. The package appears to be related to bioinformatics processing of BED files, which is common in genomics workflows.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement for a function within a bioinformatics package. No malicious activity or security concerns are evident from this minimal code snippet.",
