{
  "purpose": "The code is a test script for the 'bed_reader' package, specifically testing optional dependencies and sample file reading functionality.",
  "sources": "Input data is sourced from 'shared_datadir' for the BED file and from import statements for optional modules (scipy, pooch).",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions. The code primarily performs dependency checks and exception handling.",
  "flows": "The code reads a BED file and attempts to import optional modules, raising exceptions if missing. No untrusted data flows into sensitive functions that could lead to exploitation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The dependency handling is standard, and testing logic is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pytest and bed_reader modules, then defines a test function to check optional dependencies scipy and pooch. It attempts to import scipy; if unavailable, it verifies that reading sparse data raises ImportError, otherwise performs the read. Similarly, it checks for pooch and tests sample file retrieval. There are no network calls, no data leakage, and no code injection points. The code relies on standard import error handling and function calls with controlled inputs, which do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for dependency management within a package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no security risks. The code appears safe and purely for testing purposes.",
