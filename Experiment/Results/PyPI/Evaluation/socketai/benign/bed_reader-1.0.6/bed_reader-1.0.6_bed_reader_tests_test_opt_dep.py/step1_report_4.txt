{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the 'bed_reader' package, verifying functionality with optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest, bed_reader, optional imports from scipy and pooch, and reading files from shared_datadir.",
  "sinks": "Calls to bed.read_sparse() and sample_file() functions, which could potentially process untrusted data, but here they are used with local files.",
  "flows": "Test functions read local files and conditionally import modules, then invoke functions that may process data, but no untrusted input flows into insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code performs standard dependency checks and file reading within test functions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs dependency checks and testing functions with local files. It includes try-except blocks for optional dependencies scipy and pooch, and raises ImportError if missing. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is evident. The code uses standard testing practices with pytest. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign test script designed to verify optional dependencies and functionality of the bed_reader package. No malicious activity or security risks are identified.",
