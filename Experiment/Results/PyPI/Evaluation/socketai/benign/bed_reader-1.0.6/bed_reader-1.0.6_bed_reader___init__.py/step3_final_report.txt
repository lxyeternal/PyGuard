{
  "purpose": "This code provides import statements for BED file processing functions and related modules, serving as a setup for genomic data handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules and external Rust extensions, referencing sample data and processing functions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted input handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No active data flow; only imports and comments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and comments, with no executable logic or data processing shown. The references to Rust extensions and sample data are benign and typical for performance-optimized modules. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup for a Python package interfacing with Rust extensions for genomic data processing. There is no malicious intent or security risk evident in this snippet.",
