  "purpose": "Utility functions for fetching sample genetic data files (.bed, .bim, .fam) from remote repositories or local cache, and for creating temporary directories.",
  "sources": "Path inputs for sample_file and sample_url functions, environment variable 'BED_READER_DATA_DIR', remote URL for data fetching via 'pooch', local registry file path.",
  "sinks": "Fetching files via 'pooch', returning local file paths or URIs, creating temporary directories.",
  "flows": "Input filepath -> fetch associated files or generate URL -> return local path or URI; environment variable influences cache directory; registry file loaded during module import.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Error handling for missing 'pooch' is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard practices for data management using 'pooch', with safe path handling, environment variable support, and error handling. No network anomalies, code injection, or data leaks are present. Functions are well-documented and straightforward. External data sources are trusted (GitHub), and dependency handling is robust. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for managing sample data files with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the risk score appropriately reflects minimal security concern.",
