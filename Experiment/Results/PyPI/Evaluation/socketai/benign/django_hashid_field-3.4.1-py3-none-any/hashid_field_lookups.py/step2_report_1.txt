  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the validity of the scoring, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides custom Django ORM lookups for Hashid fields, focusing on validation, conversion, and query generation. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears standard, with proper validation and exception handling. The risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate given the lack of malicious activity. Malware score of 0 is justified; no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues found. The code is low risk, legitimate, and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on Hashid lookups with safe query construction. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Assessment:** The code uses parameterized queries and validation, minimizing injection risks. Malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; the code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard extension of Django ORM for Hashid fields, with validation and safe SQL generation.\n- **Assessment:** Proper handling of input validation and query parameterization. Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; legitimate extension code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar pattern—custom lookups with validation, safe SQL, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code follows Django best practices, with exception handling and input validation. Malware score remains at 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; secure and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—custom ORM lookups for Hashid fields, with validation and safe query construction.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. Malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; legitimate code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, indicating code is clear and understandable.\n- **Risk Score:** Consistently low (0.1–0.2), justified by the absence of malicious activity and standard practices.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code performs input validation, exception handling, and safe SQL query generation.\n- No network activity, external calls, or obfuscated/malicious code patterns are present.\n- The functions rely on external settings and classes (like Hashid), but nothing suspicious is evident.\n- The logic is consistent with standard Django ORM extension practices.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, justified by the standard, safe implementation)\n\n**In conclusion,** the supply chain security risk for this code is minimal. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured extension of Django ORM for Hashid support, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
