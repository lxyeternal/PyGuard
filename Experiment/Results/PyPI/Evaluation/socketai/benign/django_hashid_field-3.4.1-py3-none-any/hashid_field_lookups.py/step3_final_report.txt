{
  "purpose": "The code implements custom Django ORM lookups for Hashid fields, enabling validation, conversion, and safe query generation for various comparison types.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, Hashid class methods, and external settings.",
  "sinks": "SQL query construction via parameterized queries, with data flowing into WHERE clauses for lookups.",
  "flows": "Input values are validated and converted, then used as parameters in SQL statements generated by the lookup classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Exception handling is standard. No external network calls or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation to ensure correct Hashid formats, handles exceptions appropriately, and constructs parameterized SQL queries to prevent injection. It extends Django ORM lookup classes to support 'exact', 'in', 'gt', 'gte', 'lt', 'lte' operations with Hashid fields. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The logic is straightforward and adheres to Django best practices, with proper handling of iterable and subquery inputs. External dependencies like the Hashid class are assumed to be secure and correctly implemented. The exception handling and validation mitigate common security risks, and the code does not perform any network activity or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured extension of Django ORM for Hashid support, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. It follows best practices for input validation and query safety, making it suitable for supply chain deployment under the assumption that external components are secure.",
