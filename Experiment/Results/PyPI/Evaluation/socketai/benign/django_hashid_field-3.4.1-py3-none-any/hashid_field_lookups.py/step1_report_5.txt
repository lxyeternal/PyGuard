  "purpose": "Custom Django lookup and field prep code for Hashid fields to support hashid-based querying in Django ORM.",
  "sources": "Input values in get_id_for_hashid_field, value parameters in get_db_prep_lookup, rhs in process_rhs and batch_process_rhs.",
  "sinks": "None evident; code primarily processes data for database queries without executing untrusted code or performing external network actions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through get_id_for_hashid_field to generate hashid IDs, then through get_db_prep_lookup and related methods for query preparation, ending in SQL fragment construction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no hidden network connections, or suspicious data leaks. Exception handling respects security settings. Code appears consistent with Django extension patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom lookup classes for a Hashid-based ORM field, including mechanisms for value validation, query preparation, and handling of iterable values. All functions focus on safe data processing for database queries, with exception handling that can be toggled via settings. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or external data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code's structure and behavior are consistent with legitimate Django ORM extension code, with no indications of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate Django extension for Hashid field lookups. It performs data validation, query preparation, and supports iterable lookups securely. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected.",
