{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module metadata and import specific classes related to hash ID fields for a Django package, likely for use in database models.",
  "sources": "Module metadata variables (__title__, __version__, __author__, etc.), and import statements from local modules (.field and .hashid).",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this snippet, as it does not execute or process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets metadata and imports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is standard for a Python package's __init__.py or main module file, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from local modules, sets package metadata variables, and defines a version alias. All elements are typical for a package initialization or metadata definition file. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module that sets package metadata and imports relevant classes for a Django package related to Hashid fields. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks in this fragment.",
