  "purpose": "This code defines imports and metadata for a Django hashid field package, including versioning and author information.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.field, .hashid), and metadata variables (__title__, __version__, __author__, etc.)",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network operations, file writes, or data output functions in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data input/output paths are present in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are evident. Metadata variables are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and module-level metadata assignments. No dynamic execution, data processing, or external data handling occurs. The metadata includes version and author info, which are typical and benign. There is no sign of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module initialization segment with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It appears to be a standard setup for a Django package.",
