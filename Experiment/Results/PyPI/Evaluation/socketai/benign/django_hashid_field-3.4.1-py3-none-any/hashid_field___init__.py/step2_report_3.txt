  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Source Code Content and Data Flows**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is limited to static import statements and package metadata definitions. There are no data flows from untrusted sources, no user input handling, no network or file I/O, and no dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and typical for a package's `__init__.py` or module metadata.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior and Anomalies**  \n   No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected across all reports. The code contains only standard metadata variables and local imports, with no signs of hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.\n\n3. **Scores Justification**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.  \n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified as there's no security risk or vulnerability in this code fragment.\n\n4. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign, with no false positives or overestimations.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly conclude that the code is harmless. There are no claims of vulnerabilities based on assumptions.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**  \n   Since the code is purely metadata and import statements, it cannot be malicious unless the imported modules themselves are compromised. However, the reports focus solely on this snippet, which appears safe.\n\n**Summary of My Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Final Justification:**  \nGiven the code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious activity, the assigned scores are appropriate. The reports are thorough and accurate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**  \nThis code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The package appears safe based on this fragment alone.",
