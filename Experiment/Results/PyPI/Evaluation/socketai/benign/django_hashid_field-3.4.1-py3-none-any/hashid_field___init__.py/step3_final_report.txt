  "purpose": "Define package metadata and import local classes for the Django Hashid Field package.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules (.field, .hashid) and metadata variable definitions (__title__, __version__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only sets static variables and imports classes without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and static metadata variables, typical for a package's __init__.py. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling. The code is simple, well-structured, and adheres to standard conventions. No dynamic code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and poses no security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the static, metadata-only content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
