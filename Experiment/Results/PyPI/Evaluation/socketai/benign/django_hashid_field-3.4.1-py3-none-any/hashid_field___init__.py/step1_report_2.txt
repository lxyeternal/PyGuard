  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Django package that defines custom Hashid-related fields for use in Django models.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No potential sinks for untrusted data are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The version, author, and license information are straightforward metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and module metadata declarations. It imports specific field classes and a Hashid class from local modules, then sets metadata variables such as title, version, author, license, and copyright. No data processing, user input handling, or network communication is present. The code structure and syntax are standard and clear. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. The module metadata appears consistent with typical Python package conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, containing only metadata and import statements related to a Django Hashid package. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
