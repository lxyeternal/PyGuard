  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward Hashid utility class, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or malicious activities identified.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high confidence in safety.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a standard Hashid utility with proper validation, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — slightly elevated but justified as the code depends on the hashids library, which is a common dependency.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The security risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable, considering reliance on an external library, but no malicious activity is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical Hashid utility with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the lack of risky operations.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard Hashid class with proper validation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0.\n\n**Assessment:** The assessment is solid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard implementation, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — consistent with dependency usage.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0; the code is a typical utility with no malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) primarily due to dependency on the hashids library, which is standard and widely used. No actual vulnerabilities or malicious activities are present.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — clear, readable code.\n- **Risk:** Given the dependency on an external library, a conservative but justified score would be **0.1** to **0.2**. Since no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are observed, **0.1** seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                      |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1                    |\n\nThe code appears safe, benign, and standard for a Hashid utility. No further action is necessary.",
