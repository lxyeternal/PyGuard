  "purpose": "A utility class for encoding and decoding unsigned integers into hashid strings, with optional prefixes and customizable alphabet, using the hashids library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters during initialization (value, salt, min_length, alphabet, prefix). Usage of hashids.encode() and hashids.decode() methods.",
  "sinks": "hashids.encode() and hashids.decode() functions; __str__ method returning prefixed hashid; properties exposing internal data.",
  "flows": "Input validation flow from constructor -> encoding/decoding via hashids methods -> string representation or integer conversion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Use of hashids for encoding/decoding is standard; no obfuscated or unusual code structures. No network activity, file operations, or environment variable access.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a class for handling hashids, with methods for encoding/decoding, validation, and representation. It performs input validation and utilizes the hashids library appropriately. No network, file, or system modification code present. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors observed. Usage appears consistent with typical hashid handling, with no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a hashid utility class with no malicious intent. It does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration, and uses the hashids library securely and correctly. There are no obfuscated or malicious behaviors detected.",
