  "purpose": "A utility class for encoding and decoding hash IDs using the hashids library, facilitating obfuscation of numeric IDs.",
  "sources": "Input values provided during class instantiation, including 'value' parameter, environment variables (if any indirectly), and the hashids object.",
  "sinks": "Decoding functions and string representations where untrusted input could lead to invalid hash IDs or exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is validated and either encoded or decoded via the hashids library, with validation checks ensuring proper format and integrity.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious logic; standard validation and error handling are used.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Hashid utility class that wraps the hashids library. It performs input validation, encoding, decoding, and comparison operations without any network activity, file modifications, or system calls. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The reliance on the hashids library is standard and does not introduce security issues. The code's structure is clear, with proper validation and error handling. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for hash ID management, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
