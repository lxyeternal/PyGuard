{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Hashid class for encoding and decoding integers using the Hashids library, providing obfuscated identifiers with optional prefixes and configurations.",
  "sources": "Inputs include constructor parameters 'value', 'salt', 'min_length', 'alphabet', 'prefix', and an optional 'hashids' object; internal data is read from the provided or generated Hashids object.",
  "sinks": "Methods that use untrusted data include 'decode' (decodes hashid strings), and constructor validation checks; no direct data leaks or system modifications are observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' (integer or string) flows into initialization, is validated, possibly decoded, and then encoded back. The decode method processes hashid strings. No network or file operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears well-structured and standard for a Hashid utility. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. No obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The class securely manages Hashid encoding/decoding, validates inputs, and ensures internal consistency of the Hashids object. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or network activity are evident. The use of external library Hashids is for obfuscation purposes. The code enforces valid inputs and raises exceptions for invalid states, maintaining data integrity. All operations are standard and do not perform any potentially malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Hashid utility class without malicious intent. It securely manages hashing operations, validates inputs, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious code. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
