  "sources": "Reading existing settings values using getattr from django.conf.settings.",
  "sinks": "Setting attributes on the Django settings object using setattr.",
  "flows": "Read from django.conf.settings (source) and write back to settings (sink) via setattr.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious variables or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports warnings and Django settings. It then assigns default values to various HASHID_FIELD_* attributes on the settings object if they are not already defined. This involves no user input, no dynamic code execution, and no external data manipulation. The purpose appears to be configuration setup for hash IDs in Django, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs straightforward configuration initialization for HASHID_FIELD settings without any malicious behavior or security concerns. It is benign and standard in nature.",
