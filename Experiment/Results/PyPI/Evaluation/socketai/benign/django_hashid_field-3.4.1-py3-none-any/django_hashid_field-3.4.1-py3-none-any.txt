The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The low risk score (~0.1) reflects reliance on configuration and known practices such as monkey patching, which are not malicious."

The minimal security risk stems from external parameter control, which is typical and outside the code's scope. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is."
