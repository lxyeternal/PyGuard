  "purpose": "To define custom validators for Hashid fields that enforce maximum and minimum value constraints within Django models.",
  "sources": "Initialization of HashidMaxValueValidator and HashidMinValueValidator classes, particularly the 'hashid_field' parameter and the 'clean' methods.",
  "sinks": "The 'clean' methods, which call 'hashid_field.get_prep_value(x)' to process input data before validation.",
  "flows": "Input data 'x' is passed to the 'clean' method, which retrieves 'hashid_field.get_prep_value(x)', potentially transforming or validating data.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies on an external 'hashid_field' object with a method 'get_prep_value'. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The validators do not perform any network operations, file modifications, or other suspicious activities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom validator classes inheriting from Django's MaxValueValidator and MinValueValidator, respectively. Each constructor stores a reference to a 'hashid_field' object and calls the parent constructor. The 'clean' method uses 'hashid_field.get_prep_value(x)' to process input data, which suggests that the validation depends on external object behavior. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident. The logic appears straightforward, focusing on value validation with external field processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate extension of Django validators for custom Hashid fields. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in the provided snippet.",
