  "purpose": "Define custom Django validators for Hashid fields that sanitize input values using get_prep_value method.",
  "sources": "Input values passed to the clean() method of the validators.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of get_prep_value, which may process or transform data before validation.",
  "flows": "Input x -> clean() method -> hashid_field.get_prep_value(x)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or dynamic code execution detected. Use of get_prep_value is standard in Django ORM for data preparation.",
  "analysis": "The code creates custom validators inheriting from Django's MaxValueValidator and MinValueValidator, overriding the clean() method to process input via hashid_field.get_prep_value. This suggests the validators are intended to validate Hashid-based fields by pre-processing input data before applying limits. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns was found. The use of get_prep_value aligns with Django's data handling practices, and there are no external data leaks or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard custom validators for Hashid fields in Django, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
