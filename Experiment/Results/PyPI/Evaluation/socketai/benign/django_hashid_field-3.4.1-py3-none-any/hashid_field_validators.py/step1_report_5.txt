{
  "purpose": "Define custom validators for maximum and minimum value checks using a hashid field within Django models.",
  "sources": "HashidMaxValueValidator and HashidMinValueValidator classes, specifically their __init__ and clean methods, which access hashid_field and perform validation.",
  "sinks": "The clean method calls self.hashid_field.get_prep_value(x), which could process input data for validation purposes.",
  "flows": "Input x is passed to clean(), which retrieves processed value via self.hashid_field.get_prep_value(x). The __init__ methods assign hashid_field for later use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. Usage of get_prep_value suggests reliance on the hashid_field's processing method; no external or suspicious data handling is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom validator classes extending Django's MaxValueValidator and MinValueValidator. Each stores a reference to a hashid_field during initialization and overrides the clean() method to use hashid_field.get_prep_value(x) for validation. The get_prep_value method is a typical Django model field method intended to prepare data for validation or storage. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. The code appears to be straightforward, utilizing Django's established validation framework and a hashid field for value validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements custom maximum and minimum value validators using a hashid field. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, purposeful extension of Django validators for specialized use.",
