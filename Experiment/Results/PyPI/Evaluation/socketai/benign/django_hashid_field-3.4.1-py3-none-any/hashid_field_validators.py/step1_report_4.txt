{
  "purpose": "To provide custom validators for Hashid fields in Django models, enforcing maximum and minimum value constraints.",
  "sources": "Inputs to the 'clean' methods, which are called during validation, receiving values to validate.",
  "sinks": "The 'clean' methods return processed values via 'get_prep_value', which may influence database storage.",
  "flows": "Input values passed to 'clean' -> processed by 'get_prep_value' from 'hashid_field' -> returned for validation or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or obfuscated logic observed. Use of 'get_prep_value' is standard for model fields.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom validators inheriting from Django's MaxValueValidator and MinValueValidator, respectively. Each validator stores a reference to 'hashid_field' and overrides the 'clean' method to return 'hashid_field.get_prep_value(x)'. The purpose appears to be to validate the value of a Hashid field using existing validation logic, possibly transforming the input before comparison. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The usage of 'get_prep_value' suggests standard model field processing. No anomalies like hardcoded credentials or obfuscation are detected. Overall, the code appears legitimate and aligned with standard Django practices for custom validators.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides custom validators for Hashid fields, functioning as intended without any malicious behavior or security concerns. It simply delegates to 'get_prep_value' for validation purposes, with no suspicious activity present.",
