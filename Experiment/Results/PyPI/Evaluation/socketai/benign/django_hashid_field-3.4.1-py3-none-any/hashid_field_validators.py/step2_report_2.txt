  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines two custom Django validators (`HashidMaxValueValidator` and `HashidMinValueValidator`) that override the `clean()` method to process input values through `hashid_field.get_prep_value(x)`.\n   - The `get_prep_value()` method is a standard Django ORM method used for preparing data for database operations, not inherently malicious.\n   - The code appears straightforward, extending existing validators with minimal additional logic.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The reports uniformly indicate no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no external network activity, or obfuscation.\n   - The use of `get_prep_value()` is consistent with Django practices for data validation and preparation.\n   - No anomalies, such as dynamic code execution or suspicious data handling, are detected.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0.1 (very low, likely due to external dependency on `hashid_field`)\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n   - The risk scores are slightly above zero because the validators depend on an external `hashid_field` object, which could, in theory, introduce issues if misused, but no evidence suggests malicious intent.\n\n4. **Potential Malicious Behavior or Assumptions:**\n   - No claims or indications of malicious behavior are supported by the code.\n   - The use of `get_prep_value()` is standard; no suspicious transformations are evident.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is likely part of a custom validation scheme for Hashid fields, which is a common pattern.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The assigned scores are consistent with the code's benign analysis.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is justified.\n   - The security risk is minimal, justifying a low score.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a straightforward extension of Django validators, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n   - The reliance on `hashid_field.get_prep_value()` is typical for custom fields, not suspicious.\n   - No signs of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to external dependency, but generally safe)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a legitimate, standard extension of Django validators for Hashid fields, with no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
