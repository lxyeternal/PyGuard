{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom Django validators that process input values through a hashid_field's get_prep_value() method before validation, intended for validating Hashid-encoded identifiers.",
  "sources": "Input data passed to the clean() method, specifically the parameter x, which is processed via hashid_field.get_prep_value(x).",
  "sinks": "The processed value returned by get_prep_value() used in validation; no external sinks such as network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input x -> clean() method -> hashid_field.get_prep_value(x) -> validation limit check.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, standard Django pattern, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code extends Django's MaxValueValidator and MinValueValidator, overriding the clean() method to process input via hashid_field.get_prep_value(x). This pattern is typical for custom fields that encode/decode Hashid values. The use of get_prep_value() is standard in Django for data preparation. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external network activity is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: ~0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The reliance on hashid_field.get_prep_value() assumes that method is secure, but no evidence suggests malicious behavior. Overall, the code is a legitimate, safe extension of Django validators with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom Django validators for Hashid fields. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
