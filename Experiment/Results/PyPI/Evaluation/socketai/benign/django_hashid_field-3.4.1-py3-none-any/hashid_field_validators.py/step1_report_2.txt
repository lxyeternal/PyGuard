{
  "purpose": "Define custom validators for maximum and minimum value constraints that utilize a hashid_field to process values before validation.",
  "sources": "Input data is processed through the 'clean' method, which calls 'get_prep_value' on 'hashid_field'.",
  "sinks": "Validation methods 'MaxValueValidator' and 'MinValueValidator' that compare processed values against limits.",
  "flows": "Input data -> 'clean' method -> 'hashid_field.get_prep_value' -> validation against limits.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a 'hashid_field' to transform input data before validation, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. No external network interactions or data leaks are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom validator classes inheriting from Django's validators, with an added step to process the input via 'hashid_field.get_prep_value' before performing validation. This indicates some form of data transformation or decoding. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The use of 'hashid_field' appears to be a legitimate pattern for handling hashed or encoded identifiers. No suspicious external calls, obfuscation, or secret handling are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements custom validators that process input values through a 'hashid_field' before validation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The structure and functions are typical for custom Django validators with no signs of sabotage.",
