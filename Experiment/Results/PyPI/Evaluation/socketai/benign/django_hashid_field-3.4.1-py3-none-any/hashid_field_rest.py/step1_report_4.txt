{
  "purpose": "Defines custom Django REST Framework serializer fields for handling Hashids, including validation and internal conversion.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input serializer fields, configuration settings, and model field attributes.",
  "sinks": "Uses Hashid constructor and internal methods that could process untrusted data, but mostly for validation and representation.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through to validation in to_internal_value methods, then to Hashid instantiation, with validation checks performed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors. Use of dynamic model and field resolution is typical for flexible serializers. No obfuscated code or malware indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code carefully constructs Hashid objects from input data, performing validation and supporting dynamic source field configuration. It raises configuration errors for misused fields and validates input formats. No network activity, file operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. All functions appear to be standard for custom serializer fields with proper validation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom serializer fields for Hashids, with proper validation and configuration handling. No evidence of malicious behavior or malware detected. It appears secure and intended for legitimate purposes.",
