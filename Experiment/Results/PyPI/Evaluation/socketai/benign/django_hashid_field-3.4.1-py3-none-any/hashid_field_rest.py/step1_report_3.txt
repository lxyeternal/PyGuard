{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom serializer fields for handling Hashids in Django REST Framework, allowing encoding/decoding of IDs with optional salt, length, and alphabet configurations.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'data' parameter in to_internal_value methods, and 'source_field' parameter during initialization which can be a string representing a model field.",
  "sinks": "Hashid object creation and conversion to string or integer, which could potentially process untrusted input for encoding or decoding Hashids.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the user through to_internal_value, processed by super() methods, then into Hashid object creation; in to_representation, Hashid objects are converted into strings or integers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no use of insecure functions. The code dynamically retrieves model fields and constructs Hashids objects, but this appears standard and intended. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily creates custom serializer fields for Hashid handling, with flexible options for source field configuration and internal value conversion. It validates data formats and raises errors if invalid. The use of app registry to get model fields and dynamic Hashids object creation are typical patterns in Django. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. No obfuscated code, no hidden network calls, or suspicious operations detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, well-structured custom serializer fields for Hashids, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard patterns and performs expected validation and conversion tasks without suspicious behavior.",
