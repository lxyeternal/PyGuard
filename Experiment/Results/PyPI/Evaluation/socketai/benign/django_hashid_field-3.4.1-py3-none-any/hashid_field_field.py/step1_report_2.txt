  "purpose": "Define custom Hashid-based Django model fields with validation, encoding, and lookup support, integrating Hashids for obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Configuration settings (settings), input values for fields, method parameters, and data during database operations.",
  "sinks": "Hashid encoding functions, data returned by get_hashid(), from_db_value, to_python, get_prep_value, and contribute_to_class methods.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., IDs) is processed via get_hashid() to produce Hashid objects or strings, stored in database, and retrieved via from_db_value() and to_python(), possibly passing through validators.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of Hashids is standard for obfuscation, not malicious. No obfuscated code techniques detected. Validation logic is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines custom Django model fields utilizing Hashids for obfuscation. Initialization parameters and settings are validated for correctness. The use of Hashids is standard, with proper validation and deconstruction logic. The code leverages Django's validation framework and provides custom lookup classes, but nothing suspicious or malicious is present. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code appears to be a typical implementation for obscuring integer IDs with Hashids, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of Hashid-based Django model fields. It includes necessary validation and configuration, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for obfuscating IDs, with proper use of Django's validation and field mechanisms.",
