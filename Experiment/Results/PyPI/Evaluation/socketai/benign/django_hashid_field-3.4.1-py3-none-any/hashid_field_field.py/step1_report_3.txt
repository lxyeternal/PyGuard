{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom Django model fields for obscured integer IDs using Hashids, along with associated validators, lookups, and descriptors to integrate with Django ORM and admin.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration settings (settings module), input data through model fields, and external Hashids library.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external systems or performs output operations; it primarily processes and validates data internally.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from model instances into validators and hashid encoding functions; hashid objects are generated and used internally for ID obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual logic. The code relies on standard Django practices and the Hashids library, which is open-source. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom Django model fields that encode integer IDs into Hashids strings to obscure database IDs. It performs validation, encoding, and integration with Django's ORM and admin interface. It uses standard practices, relies on a well-known third-party library (hashids), and includes configuration checks for alphabet length and salt presence. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or unauthorized data access. The code does not perform network communication, file access, or system modifications outside of the expected scope of a Django application. No obfuscation or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of Hashid-based obscured ID fields for Django models. It is well-structured, uses common practices, and shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It should be considered safe based on the provided code fragment.",
