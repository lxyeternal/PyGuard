  "purpose": "Defines custom Hashid model fields with validation, encoding, and lookup support.",
  "sources": "Configuration, user input, class attributes, Hashids library.",
  "sinks": "Encoded hashes, validators, database interactions.",
  "flows": "User input → validation/encoding → database storage/retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code validates alphabet length, salt presence, and uses standard Hashids features. It performs ID encoding and decoding, integrates with Django ORM and admin, and applies validation and lookup mechanisms appropriately. No malicious activity, network activity, or backdoors are present. The monkey patching of DRF serializers is a known pattern for ensuring proper serialization and does not indicate malicious intent. The code relies on configuration settings and standard libraries, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of Hashid-based Django fields, with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The low risk score (~0.1) reflects reliance on configuration and known practices such as monkey patching, which are not malicious.",
