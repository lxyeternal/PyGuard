  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of Hashid-based Django fields, with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The low risk score (~0.1) reflects reliance on configuration and known practices such as monkey patching, which are not malicious."
