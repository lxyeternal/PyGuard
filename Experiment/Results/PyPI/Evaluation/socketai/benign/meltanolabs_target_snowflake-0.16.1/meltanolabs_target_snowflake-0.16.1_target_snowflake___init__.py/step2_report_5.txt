  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of the issues in the code:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a minimal, benign snippet containing only a docstring, a future import, and a version string.\n   - There are no functions, data handling, network calls, or any executable logic.\n   - Based on the code provided, **no issues such as malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present**.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and minimal.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The conclusions are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Security risk scores are very low or zero, consistent with the minimal, non-executable nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues, **risk scores should remain very low or zero**.\n   - The current scores reflect this accurately.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No malicious behavior is detected.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or contain suspicious patterns.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is benign and metadata-like.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to zero)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, non-malicious, metadata snippet with no security risks. All reports correctly identify this. No further action or concern is warranted based on the provided code.\n\n**Note:** If this code is part of a larger package, a review of the entire package would be necessary, but based solely on this snippet, the security posture is benign.",
