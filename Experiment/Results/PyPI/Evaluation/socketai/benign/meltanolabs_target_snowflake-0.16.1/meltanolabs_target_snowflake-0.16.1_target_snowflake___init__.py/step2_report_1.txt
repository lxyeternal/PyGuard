  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the associated code snippets.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports describe minimal, metadata-like code: a docstring, a future import, and a version string.\n- No data processing, network activity, or executable logic is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be a simple module header or metadata declaration, likely part of a larger package.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code contains only minimal metadata and no functional or malicious code.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  **No.** The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  - *Obfuscated:* all reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n  - *Malware:* all assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n  - *Security risk:* all assign very low scores (0 or 0.1), reflecting negligible risk.\n\n---\n\n### Specific observations:\n\n- The **risk scores** are all very low (mostly 0 or 0.1). Given the code's benign nature, this seems appropriate.\n- The **malware scores** are all 0, which is correct since no malicious behavior is detected.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are all 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The **confidence levels** are high (1 or 0.9), which is justified given the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n- **Potential for higher risk or malware?**  \n  No. The code is purely declarative and contains no executable or suspicious elements.\n\n- **Any assumptions to challenge?**  \n  No. The reports avoid assumptions and correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Estimated scores based on the analysis:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe.
