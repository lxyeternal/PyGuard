  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in the provided code",
  "flows": "No data flow; code contains only imports and metadata",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; very minimal code, no secrets, no obfuscated elements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a docstring comment, a future import statement, and a version string assignment. There are no functions, classes, or external data sources. No signs of malicious activity, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors. The code appears to be a minimal module header with no executable logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module header with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
