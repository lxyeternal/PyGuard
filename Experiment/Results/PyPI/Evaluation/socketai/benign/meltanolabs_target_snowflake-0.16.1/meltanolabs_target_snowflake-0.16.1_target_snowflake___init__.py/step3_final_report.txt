  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for a Singer.io target for Snowflake, including versioning and future annotations.",
  "sources": "No data input/output, environment variables, or external data sources; only a docstring, import statement, and version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; code is declarative with no runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, network activity, secrets, or obfuscation; minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module header containing a descriptive docstring, a future import for annotations, and a version string. It does not perform any operations, handle data, or include suspicious patterns. The minimal nature and lack of dynamic or network behavior indicate no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as metadata or module information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores and analysis are accurate and justified.",
