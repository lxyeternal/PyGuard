  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of the reported issues in the code:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a minimal, benign module containing only a docstring, a future import, and a version string.\n   - The actual code snippet confirms this: no functions, no data handling, no network activity, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues, malicious behavior, or security risks are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as minimal and benign.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risks of 0 or very close to 0.\n   - Given the code's nature, these scores are appropriate.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely declarative with no executable or network activity, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The reports' current scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions; no malware detected.\n   - The malware scores of 0 are correct.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as non-malicious and non-obfuscated.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a simple, benign module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current reports and scores accurately reflect this. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
