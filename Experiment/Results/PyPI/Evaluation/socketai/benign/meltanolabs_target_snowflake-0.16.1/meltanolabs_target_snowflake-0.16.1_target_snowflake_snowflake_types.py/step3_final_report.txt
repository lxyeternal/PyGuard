  "purpose": "Extend Snowflake custom types by specifying their corresponding Python data types.",
  "sources": "The class initializers and property definitions within each custom type class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input.",
  "flows": "The code defines static class properties; no data flow from external sources to sinks exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions inheriting from Snowflake custom types, overriding the 'python_type' property to specify expected Python data types. There are no network operations, data processing, or security-sensitive actions. The reports are empty, providing no evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or obfuscation. The code is benign, well-structured, and typical for type extension purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The empty reports do not indicate any issues. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is 0.",
