  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The provided code appears to define custom types that extend Snowflake's SQLAlchemy types, adding a `python_type` property to specify the expected Python data type.\n   - There are no obvious security vulnerabilities, malicious code, or malicious behavior in this code snippet.\n   - The code itself is straightforward and seems to serve a type-mapping purpose.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Summary:**\n   - The reports contain only \"Empty response\" messages with no additional details.\n   - Since the reports do not provide any specific findings, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior, there is no evidence to suggest issues based on the report content.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - Because the reports are empty, any malware, obfuscation, or risk scores assigned would be purely speculative.\n   - Without evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities, the scores should be minimal or zero.\n   - If the scoring system assigns higher scores automatically, it should be overridden in this case due to lack of evidence.\n\n4. **Potential Misinterpretations or Assumptions:**\n   - There are no claims or assumptions in the reports to challenge, as they contain no details.\n   - The code itself does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - Since no issues are identified, the scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should all be close to zero.\n   - Any higher scores would be unjustified without supporting evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no risks identified)\n\n### Summary:\nBased on the provided code and the reports, there is no evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The reports are empty, so the scores should reflect that.\n\n**Recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nPlease let me know if further details or analysis are needed.",
