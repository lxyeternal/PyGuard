  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The provided code defines custom Snowflake data types by subclassing existing types from `snowflake.sqlalchemy.custom_types`. The classes are straightforward, mainly overriding the `python_type` property.\n   - There are no apparent vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation in this code snippet.\n   - The code appears to be standard extension of SQLAlchemy types for Snowflake, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - All reports are empty (\"Empty response\"), providing no details about potential issues.\n   - Without detailed reports, it's impossible to identify specific vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or logic flaws.\n   - The lack of report content suggests either an incomplete report or that no issues were found.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Since no specific issues are described, the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be very low or zero.\n   - Any higher scores would be unjustified without evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n   - The code itself, as provided, does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - If the reports were meant to identify malicious code or vulnerabilities, the absence of details prevents validation.\n   - No evidence suggests the code is malicious or obfuscated.\n   - The code is simple and standard, unlikely to pose security risks.\n\n5. **Summary of Scores:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0, as there's no indication of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0, the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk score:** 0, no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are empty, providing no evidence of issues.\n- The code appears benign, standard, and free of obfuscation.\n- Scores should reflect the lack of issues: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0**.\n\n**Note:** Always verify with more detailed reports or additional context if available. In this case, the absence of report details leads to a conclusion of no concerns.",
