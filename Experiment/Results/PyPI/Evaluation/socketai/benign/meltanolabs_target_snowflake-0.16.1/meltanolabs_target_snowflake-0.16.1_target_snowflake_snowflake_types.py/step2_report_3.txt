  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code defines custom classes for Snowflake data types (`TIMESTAMP_NTZ`, `NUMBER`, `VARIANT`) that inherit from a `custom_types` module.\n   - Each class overrides the `python_type` property to specify the corresponding Python type (`datetime`, `float`, `dict`).\n\n2. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code appears syntactically correct.\n   - The inheritance and property overrides are straightforward.\n   - No obvious security vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or other potentially risky actions.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All reports are \"Empty response\" with no details provided.\n   - No evidence or indication of issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity from the reports.\n\n4. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - Since all reports contain only empty responses, there is no substantive information to evaluate.\n   - The reports do not provide any reasoning, evidence, or context.\n\n5. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Given the lack of information, any risk, malware, or obfuscation scores should be minimal or zero.\n   - The absence of any malicious indicators or suspicious activity supports low scores.\n\n6. **Potential for Malicious Activity:**\n   - The code is purely defining data types; no malicious behavior is evident.\n   - The \"malware score\" should be zero.\n\n7. **Assumptions and Claims:**\n   - No assumptions are made in the reports, and none can be derived from the provided data.\n\n8. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - Since no issues are identified, the scores should reflect that—likely all close to zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Security:** No issues detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, based on the provided code and reports, there is no evidence of a security incident or malicious activity.** The reports seem to lack content, so no further concerns are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The reports are empty; no issues to escalate.\n- Scores should be minimal, with no suspicion of malware or obfuscation.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if additional context or details become available.",
