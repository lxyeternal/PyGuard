  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The provided code appears to be a straightforward extension of Snowflake custom types, adding a `python_type` property to each. There are no obvious vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The code itself is benign and typical for type customization.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports contain only \"Empty response\" errors with no additional details.\n   - Without actual report content, I cannot identify or verify any issues or vulnerabilities claimed in those reports.\n   - The lack of detailed information prevents a thorough review or validation of potential security concerns.\n\n3. **Scores and their reasonableness:**\n   - Since no actual issues or findings are provided, assigning any risk, malware, or obfuscation scores would be speculative.\n   - If the reports had claimed vulnerabilities, I would evaluate their validity based on the provided code, but here, there's nothing to analyze.\n\n4. **Malware and obfuscation considerations:**\n   - The code is simple, readable, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs.\n   - The \"Empty response\" reports do not suggest any malware activity or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Challenging assumptions:**\n   - Since the reports are empty, I cannot challenge any claims based on assumptions.\n   - No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are apparent from the code snippet.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - Given the lack of detailed findings, scores should logically be minimal or zero.\n   - Any higher scores would be unjustified without concrete evidence.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code appears safe and well-structured.\n- The reports lack content, making it impossible to identify or confirm any security issues.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident.\n- Scores should be set to zero or near-zero due to the absence of reported issues.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis is a cautious and reasoned conclusion based on the provided information.",
