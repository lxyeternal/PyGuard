  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The provided code defines custom classes inheriting from `snowflake.sqlalchemy.custom_types`. Each class overrides the `python_type` property to specify the expected Python data type.\n   - The code appears straightforward and correct for extending Snowflake custom types, with no apparent vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic.\n\n2. **Reports Analysis:**\n   - All five reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no additional details.\n   - This suggests that the reports lack content, making it impossible to identify specific issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity.\n   - Without further information, there's no basis to suspect supply chain attacks, malicious code, or vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Since no issues are detailed, the risk, malware, or obfuscation scores should logically be very low or zero.\n   - Assigning high scores without evidence would be unjustified.\n   - The \"Empty response\" reports likely indicate either missing data or incomplete reporting, not actual security issues.\n\n4. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code itself is benign and appears correctly implemented.\n   - The reports do not provide any actionable information.\n   - There are no assumptions or claims to challenge, given the lack of detail.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no identified vulnerabilities or issues)\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the provided code and the empty reports, there is no indication of a supply chain security incident or malicious activity. The reports seem incomplete or non-informative. No further action is necessary unless additional details are provided.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure reports contain sufficient details before assigning higher risk scores.",
