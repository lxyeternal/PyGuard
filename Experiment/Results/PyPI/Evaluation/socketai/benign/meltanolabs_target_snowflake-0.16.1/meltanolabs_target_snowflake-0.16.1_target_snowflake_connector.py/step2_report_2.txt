  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence for malicious activity, correctness of the scoring, and consistency with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report concludes the code is legitimate, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It notes standard cryptography practices, proper credential handling, and safe SQL statement construction.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and standard use of cryptography libraries. The low risk score aligns with the observations.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusions and scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard credential handling, no malicious intent, and safe practices.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores and reasoning are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the potential for dynamic SQL construction and the handling of private keys. Notes that while the code is standard, dynamic SQL via string formatting could pose risks if inputs are malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.3\n\n- **Assessment:** The code does generate SQL with string formatting (e.g., in `get_initialize_script`, `_adapt_column_type`), which could be a vector if inputs are untrusted. However, no evidence of malicious intent or actual exploitation. The risk score of 0.3 reflects moderate concern, which seems appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is cautious but justified. No malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, notes the use of string interpolation in SQL commands, potential injection if inputs are malicious, but no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.4\n\n- **Assessment:** The higher risk score accounts for the dynamic SQL construction without explicit sanitization. This is a valid concern but not evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes the code's legitimate schema management and data operations, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Matches the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's content. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Vary from 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting concerns about dynamic SQL construction and handling of secrets, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** Given the code's nature, the main risks are related to SQL injection via dynamic SQL string formatting and handling secrets. These are standard concerns but do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Recommended scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2 - 0.3 |\n\n**Justification:**  \n- The code is a standard database connector, with no malware or obfuscation.  \n- The moderate risk stems from dynamic SQL string formatting without explicit sanitization, which is common but warrants caution.  \n- Proper input validation elsewhere can mitigate these concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and justified. The code appears safe, with the only caveats being standard security considerations for dynamic SQL generation and secret handling, but no malicious intent or activity is evident.",
