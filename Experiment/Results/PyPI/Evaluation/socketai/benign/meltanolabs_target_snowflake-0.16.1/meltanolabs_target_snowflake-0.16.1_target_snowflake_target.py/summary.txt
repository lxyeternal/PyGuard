  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured Snowflake target class with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor typo in the callback method name is benign. The external 'initializer()' should be reviewed separately, but based on current evidence, the supply chain security risk is minimal."
