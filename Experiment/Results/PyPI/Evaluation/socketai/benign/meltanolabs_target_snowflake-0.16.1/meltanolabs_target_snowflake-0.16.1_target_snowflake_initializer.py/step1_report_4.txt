  "purpose": "Interactive script to initialize a Snowflake account by creating roles, users, warehouses, and databases, and executing corresponding SQL commands.",
  "sources": "User input prompts for role, user, password, warehouse, database, account, admin user, and admin password; data from SnowflakeConnector.get_initialize_script().",
  "sinks": "Execution of generated SQL script via database connection; user prompts for confirmation before executing SQL statements.",
  "flows": "User inputs (role, user, password, etc.) are used to generate an SQL script; upon confirmation, the script is executed through Snowflake database connection.",
  "anomalies": "Use of user prompts for sensitive information such as passwords and account details; no hardcoded secrets, but sensitive data is collected dynamically.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a user-interactive initialization tool for Snowflake. It gathers input for account setup, generates SQL commands, and executes them after user confirmation. There are no signs of malicious code such as hidden backdoors, network communication to suspicious domains, or malicious system modifications. The use of prompts for passwords and sensitive details is standard for interactive scripts but could be risky if misused or misconfigured. The SQL execution is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. The script relies on an external SnowflakeConnector class, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior within this provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, interactive database initialization script without malicious intent or malicious code. It carefully prompts for sensitive data, generates, and executes SQL commands based on user input. No malware, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated code detected. Slight security concern is the handling of sensitive input, but this is typical for such scripts.",
