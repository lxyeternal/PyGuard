{
  "purpose": "Implements a Snowflake data sink for batch processing, staging, merging, and cleanup within a data pipeline.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters, record data, environment variables, and file URLs for staging and cleanup.",
  "sinks": "Uploads batch files to Snowflake stage, merges or copies data into target tables, and cleans up temporary files.",
  "flows": "Batch files are serialized, uploaded to stage, then merged or copied into tables; cleanup removes local files post-processing.",
  "anomalies": "Uses UUIDs for staging IDs; cleanup via os.remove on URL-parsed paths; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard practices for data ingestion into Snowflake, including schema setup, batch staging, merging, and cleanup. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. UUIDs are used for unique staging identifiers, which is typical. The cleanup process relies on URL parsing and file removal, which is common but should be handled carefully if URLs are untrusted. No network activity or data exfiltration signs are detected. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and confidence is high given the straightforward, well-structured implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Snowflake sink implementation with no indicators of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
