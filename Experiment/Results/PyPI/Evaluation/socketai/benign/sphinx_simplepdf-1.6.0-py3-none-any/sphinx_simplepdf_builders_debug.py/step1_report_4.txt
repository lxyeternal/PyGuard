  "purpose": "To retrieve information about the current Python environment, including the executable path, installed packages, and OS details.",
  "sources": "sys.executable (Python executable path), pkgutil.iter_modules() (package discovery), pkg_resources.get_distribution() (package version info), platform.system() and platform.release() (OS info).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input to perform security-sensitive actions are present.",
  "flows": "The code collects package names and retrieves their versions, and obtains OS information, without passing untrusted data to sensitive functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. The code mainly reads environment info and package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for collecting environment information. It uses standard library modules and well-known package management libraries to list installed packages and get system details. There is no data flow from untrusted sources to security-critical sinks, and no suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for environment introspection with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward and uses standard methods.",
