  "purpose": "Retrieve environment information including Python executable path, installed packages with versions, and OS details.",
  "sources": "sys.executable, pkgutil.iter_modules(), pkg_resources.get_distribution(), platform.system(), platform.release()",
  "sinks": "None; data is read locally and not transmitted or used in untrusted ways",
  "flows": "Source data (sys.executable, package list, OS info) is collected and returned; no external or untrusted data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard libraries, broad exception handling is benign, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward environment info utility, gathering system executable path, installed package versions, and OS info using standard libraries. It does not perform any network activity, code execution, or data transmission. Exception handling is broad but only defaults to 'unknown' for missing package versions, which is acceptable. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The purpose appears to be diagnostics or debugging, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment inspection utility with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and their assigned scores are appropriate. The overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), malware and obfuscation scores are zero. No modifications are necessary.",
