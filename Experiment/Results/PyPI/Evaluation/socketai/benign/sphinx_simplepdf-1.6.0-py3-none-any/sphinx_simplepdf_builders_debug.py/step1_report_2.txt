  "purpose": "To retrieve and display information about the current Python executable, installed packages, and the operating system.",
  "sources": "sys.executable (Python executable path), pkgutil.iter_modules() (module discovery), pkg_resources.get_distribution() (package version info), platform.system() and platform.release() (OS info).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "None of the source data is used in a context that would cause harm; data is only retrieved and returned as information.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are observed; the code performs standard system and package information gathering.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods to retrieve the current Python executable path, list installed packages with their versions, and obtain OS information. The package listing involves iterating through available modules and attempting to get their versions, defaulting to 'unknown' if unavailable. No code executes untrusted input, nor does it connect to external networks or handle sensitive data beyond package info.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate system and environment queries without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code and is safe for use.",
