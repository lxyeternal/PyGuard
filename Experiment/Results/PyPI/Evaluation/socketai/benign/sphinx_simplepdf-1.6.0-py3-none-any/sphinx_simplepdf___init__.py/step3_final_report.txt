  "purpose": "Register custom directives for the Sphinx extension related to PDF inclusion and conditional content.",
  "sources": "Directive classes imported from sphinx_simplepdf.directives modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Import directives -> register directives with app -> no data flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward registration code with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific directive classes and registers them via app.add_directive, then returns a safety dictionary. It performs no data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simple registration pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Sphinx extension setup script registering directives without any malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
