{
  "purpose": "Embed a PDF into HTML via an iframe with configurable options.",
  "sources": "The 'pdf_file' argument (URL/path) directly inserted into iframe src; options like 'height', 'width', 'page', 'toolbar' are retrieved from directive options.",
  "sinks": "The 'pdf_file' value is embedded into the iframe src attribute without validation or sanitization, potentially leading to injection or XSS if untrusted input is used.",
  "flows": "Input 'pdf_file' flows directly into the HTML iframe src attribute; options are appended as URL parameters; no sanitization occurs between source and sink.",
  "anomalies": "No input validation or sanitization on 'pdf_file'; direct string interpolation into HTML without escaping; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an iframe embedding a PDF URL directly into HTML without sanitization, creating a potential injection vulnerability if 'pdf_file' is controlled by an attacker. The code is straightforward, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. The primary concern is the injection risk, not malware. The reports correctly identify this issue, assigning malware scores of 0 and moderate security risk scores (~0.2-0.4). The scores are consistent with the analysis. To mitigate risk, input validation or sanitization should be added to prevent injection attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in intent but vulnerable to injection if untrusted input is used. No malware or obfuscation is present. The primary security concern is input validation. The current scores are appropriate; malware score remains 0, and risk score should be around 0.3. Implementing sanitization would reduce the injection risk.",
