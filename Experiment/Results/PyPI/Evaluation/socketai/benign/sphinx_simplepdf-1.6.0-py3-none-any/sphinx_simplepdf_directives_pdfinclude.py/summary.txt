  "conclusion": "The code is benign in intent but vulnerable to injection if untrusted input is used. No malware or obfuscation is present. The primary security concern is input validation. The current scores are appropriate; malware score remains 0, and risk score should be around 0.3. Implementing sanitization would reduce the injection risk."
