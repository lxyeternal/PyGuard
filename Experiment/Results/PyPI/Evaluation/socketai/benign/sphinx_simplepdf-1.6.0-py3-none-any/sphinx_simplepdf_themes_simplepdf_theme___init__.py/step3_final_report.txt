  "purpose": "Configure and register a Sphinx theme by determining theme path and setting up theme registration.",
  "sources": "Filesystem path calculations using os.path and __file__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sinks; no network or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Path functions use __file__ to determine directories; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard library functions, and performs static configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static directory path resolution and theme registration for Sphinx. It uses only standard library functions and does not process untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard configuration code for a Sphinx theme. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
