  "purpose": "Define theme-related functions for a Sphinx documentation theme, providing theme path and setup configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'os' module, use of __file__ variable for directory paths.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data leaks or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "The code reads the current file's directory path and passes it to other functions, but does not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no unusual behavior or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and typical for theme setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version variables, retrieves directory paths based on the current file location, and sets up theme configurations for Sphinx. It uses standard library functions without any dynamic code execution or external data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The commented-out CSS file inclusion does not impact security. Overall, the code is clean, simple, and typical for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serves to configure a Sphinx theme, and shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
