{
  "purpose": "Define a Sphinx theme setup, providing theme path and configuration for documentation building.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own directory paths, imports 'path' from 'os', and accesses the '__file__' variable.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used in a way that could cause data leaks or execution.",
  "flows": "The code constructs absolute paths based on its location, used for theme configuration in Sphinx.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'path' from 'os' to handle directory paths. It defines version information. The 'get_html_theme_path' function calculates the theme directory path relative to the file location. The 'setup' function registers a theme with Sphinx and returns a configuration dictionary. No external data is fetched, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution is present. The code is straightforward, standard for Sphinx theme setup, and lacks any signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Sphinx theme setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
