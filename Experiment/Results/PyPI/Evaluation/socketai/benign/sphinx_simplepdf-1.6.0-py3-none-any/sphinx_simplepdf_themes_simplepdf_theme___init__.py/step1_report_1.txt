{
  "purpose": "Provide theme path resolution and setup for a Sphinx documentation theme.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own directory path and the current file's directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Path calculations (using os.path) do not process untrusted input, so no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs straightforward directory path operations and theme setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version variables, a function to determine the theme path, and a setup function for Sphinx. It uses standard library functions without any user input or external data sources. The setup function registers a theme with a static name and path, with no dynamic or insecure behavior. No malicious or suspicious activities are present. The code structure is typical for a Sphinx theme configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign Sphinx theme configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks.",
