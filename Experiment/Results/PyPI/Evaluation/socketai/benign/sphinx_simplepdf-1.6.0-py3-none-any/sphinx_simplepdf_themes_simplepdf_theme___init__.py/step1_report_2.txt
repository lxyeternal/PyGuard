  "purpose": "Provides functions to determine theme paths for Sphinx documentation and sets up a theme for the application.",
  "sources": "Reads the current directory path using os.path.abspath and os.path.dirname.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "Uses safe path functions to determine directory paths; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. Commented-out code does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines version info, retrieves directory paths relative to the file location, and registers a theme with Sphinx. All functions use standard Python libraries and perform filesystem path manipulations. No external network access, data exfiltration, or malicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward theme setup for Sphinx documentation, with no malicious behavior detected.",
