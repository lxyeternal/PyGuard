  "conclusion": "The dependency code shows red flags such as obfuscation and dynamic code execution, which could facilitate malicious activities like data exfiltration or system compromise. While no direct malicious payloads are confirmed, the suspicion level justifies elevated scores, especially in reports highlighting eval/exec usage. Further dynamic analysis and runtime monitoring are recommended to conclusively determine malicious intent."
