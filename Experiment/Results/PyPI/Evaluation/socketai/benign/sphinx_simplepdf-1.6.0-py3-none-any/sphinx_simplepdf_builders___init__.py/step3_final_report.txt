  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and malicious indicators.",
  "sources": "Code input, dynamic execution functions, control flow structures, environment variables, network communication points, data handling routines.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file write operations, environment variable access, system command executions, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Source inputs through obfuscated or complex control flow leading to potential data leaks or malicious actions, such as network communication or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, complex control flow, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity; absence of code limits analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution indicators, which are suspicious but not definitive of malicious intent. Lack of concrete malicious activity or vulnerabilities reduces concern. The scores assigned (malware: 0.3, obfuscated: 0.7, risk: 0.4) are consistent with suspicion due to obfuscation but lack of evidence. Other reports lack code, justifying zero scores and low confidence. Overall, the evidence suggests low to moderate suspicion, with no confirmed malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation but no direct malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. The overall security posture is benign, with moderate suspicion in the first report due to obfuscation. No further action required unless new evidence emerges.",
