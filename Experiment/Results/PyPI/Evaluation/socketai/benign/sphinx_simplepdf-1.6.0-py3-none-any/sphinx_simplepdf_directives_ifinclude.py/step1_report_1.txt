  "purpose": "A Sphinx extension directive to conditionally include files based on the builder name.",
  "sources": "The 'content' attribute (list of filenames), the 'arguments' attribute (builder name).",
  "sinks": "The 'insert_input' method injecting include directives into the document source.",
  "flows": "Arguments -> run() method -> insert_input() with include directives.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Sphinx directive that includes specified files only if the current builder matches a provided name. It safely constructs file paths and inserts include directives into the document source. The content and arguments are used to determine which files to include, with no evident malicious data handling. The insertion of include directives is a standard Sphinx pattern, and no external network, system modification, or secret handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx directive for conditional file inclusion. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It functions as intended to improve documentation build customization.",
