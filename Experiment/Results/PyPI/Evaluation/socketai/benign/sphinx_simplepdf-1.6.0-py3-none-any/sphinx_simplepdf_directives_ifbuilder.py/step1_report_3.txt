{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom Sphinx directive to conditionally add content based on the builder used.",
  "sources": "self.arguments, self.content, self.env.app.builder.name",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data processed in a way that leads to vulnerabilities or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Arguments are used to compare builder name; content is parsed only if the condition matches.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, or suspicious code. The code relies on standard Sphinx extension patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines a directive class with methods and properties that interact with the Sphinx environment. The run() method conditionally processes content based on builder name, utilizing nested parsing to insert content only if the builder matches. There is no evidence of code injection, malicious data handling, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a typical implementation of a conditional directive for documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign Sphinx extension component designed for conditional content inclusion. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
