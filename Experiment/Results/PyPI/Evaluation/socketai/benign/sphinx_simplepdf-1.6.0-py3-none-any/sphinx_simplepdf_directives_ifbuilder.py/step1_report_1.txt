  "purpose": "Define a Sphinx directive to conditionally include content based on the builder used.",
  "sources": "User-defined directive arguments and content within the directive",
  "sinks": "Rendering of nested parsed content, potential if the environment is manipulated",
  "flows": "Input arguments and content → check builder name → conditionally parse content → generate nodes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution beyond standard Sphinx parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom Sphinx directive that renders content only if the current builder matches a specified name. It accesses environment variables safely and performs standard parsing and node creation. No external network calls, no handling of untrusted input beyond normal Sphinx processing, and no suspicious logic. The usage of properties and the run method aligns with typical Sphinx extension practices. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Sphinx directive implementation intended for conditional content inclusion. It does not contain malware, malicious logic, or security risks. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
