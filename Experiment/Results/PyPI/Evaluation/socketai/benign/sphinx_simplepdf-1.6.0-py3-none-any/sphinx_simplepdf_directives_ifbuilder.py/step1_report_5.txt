  "purpose": "This code defines a custom Sphinx directive for conditional content rendering based on the builder used.",
  "sources": "self.arguments, self.content, self.env.app.builder.name",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data is sent over the network or written to files",
  "flows": "self.arguments[0] (builder name) → comparison with self.env.app.builder.name; self.content → nested_parse_with_titles",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a Sphinx directive that conditionally inserts content based on the builder name. It retrieves configuration and environment data securely. The 'run' method compares the builder name in a case-insensitive manner, then parses the content if conditions match, using standard Sphinx utilities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors. The use of standard libraries and functions suggests normal behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate Sphinx extension component designed for conditional documentation content. It contains no malicious or suspicious activity, posing no security risk.",
