  "conclusion": "The code is standard for Maya environment management, with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary risk stems from executing external scripts, which should be trusted. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is absent, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3). The reports' assessments are accurate and justified."
