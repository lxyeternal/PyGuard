  "purpose": "Utilities for getting Maya resource directories, sourcing scripts, and executing deferred functions within Maya environment.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., MAYA_LOCATION, MAYA_APP_DIR), filesystem paths, script files read via execfile, external scripts executed via exec.",
  "sinks": "execfile() for executing external scripts, os.environ modifications, directory walking and path modifications, exec() for executing strings or code snippets.",
  "flows": "Source data from environment variables or filesystem -> potential execution via execfile or exec -> environment modifications or path updates.",
  "anomalies": "Use of execfile and exec for dynamic code execution; no validation or sandboxing of external scripts; standard utility functions with inherent risks.",
  "analysis": "The code provides environment setup and script sourcing utilities typical for Maya workflows. It relies on dynamic execution functions (`execfile`, `exec`) which pose security risks if external scripts are malicious or compromised. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The use of environment variables and directory traversal is standard but should be trusted. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.4) are justified given the context. The main concern is executing external scripts, which is inherent to such utilities but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for Maya environment management, with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary risk stems from executing external scripts, which should be trusted. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is absent, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3). The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
