  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code performs standard module imports, environment checks, and internal configuration. No malicious patterns, no untrusted data handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. **Appropriate.**\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on internal flags and module imports. No malicious activity or suspicious behavior. The manipulation of internal flags is typical for startup routines.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.9 (originally).  \n  **Justification for risk score:** Although the code is benign, the high risk score may be overly cautious given the lack of malicious activity. It might be more appropriate to lower it to 0.2–0.3, considering the internal manipulations are standard in complex setups.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** The reassignment of `_pymel.all` to the current module's name is somewhat unconventional and could be used to obscure the namespace. However, no malicious intent is evident; it appears to be an internal design choice.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.  \n  **Justification:** The risk score is slightly elevated due to namespace manipulation but not high enough to warrant concern.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The script is straightforward, performing imports, setting flags, and conditional UI imports based on batch mode. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.0 or 0.1.  \n  **Justification:** The minimal risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Standard import and initialization code with no malicious patterns. No obfuscation or suspicious data flows.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.  \n  **Justification:** Slightly elevated risk score may be for conservative safety, but overall, the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Justification & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is standard for initializing a complex library environment.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** While most reports assign very low risk, Report 2's original score of 0.9 seems overly cautious given the benign nature. A more reasonable risk score would be around 0.2–0.3, reflecting internal manipulations that are typical in such setups but not malicious.\n\n### **Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — minor internal manipulations, but overall safe.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard initialization routine for the pymel library in Maya, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The slight namespace reassignments are typical for complex module setups and do not indicate security issues. The overall security posture is very high, with negligible risk.",
