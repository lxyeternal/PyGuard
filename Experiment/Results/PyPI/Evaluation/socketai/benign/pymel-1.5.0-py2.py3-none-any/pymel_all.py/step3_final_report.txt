{
  "purpose": "Initialize the pymel environment in Maya by importing modules, configuring internal flags, and setting up namespace and UI components.",
  "sources": "Module imports, internal flag manipulations, environment checks (cmds.about), namespace reassignments",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, no external communications or code execution",
  "flows": "Imports and internal flag settings occur at startup; namespace reassignment (_pymel.all) assigns current module to a global attribute; environment check influences conditional UI imports",
  "anomalies": "Reassignment of _pymel.all to sys.modules[__name__], which is unconventional but not malicious; internal flag manipulations are typical in complex startup routines",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup for pymel, including imports, environment checks, and internal configuration. The namespace reassignment (_pymel.all = sys.modules[__name__]) is unusual but not malicious. No network activity, credential handling, or dynamic code execution is present. The internal flag manipulations are typical for startup routines. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The code is transparent and intended for environment setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign initialization routine for pymel with some unconventional namespace handling that does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, and no malware is present.",
