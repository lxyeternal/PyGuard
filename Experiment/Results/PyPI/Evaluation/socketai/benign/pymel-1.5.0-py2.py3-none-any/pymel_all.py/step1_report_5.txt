{
  "purpose": "To import and initialize various pymel modules and submodules for interactive scripting in Maya.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from __future__, sys, pymel, pymel.internal, pymel.util.arrays, pymel.core, maya.cmds.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; standard module imports and internal function calls only.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules, sets some internal flags, and initializes modules for use; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The import statements and internal startup calls are standard and expected for this context.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules, sets internal flags, and logs some debug messages. It modifies the 'finalizeEnabled' flag for startup procedures, then calls 'startup.finalize()'. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The structure is typical for module initialization scripts, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard module import and initialization routine for pymel in Maya. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, and no data flows indicate malicious activity. It appears safe with no security risks.",
