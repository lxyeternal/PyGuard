{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to import and set up the pymel library, providing a unified namespace for interactive scripting in Maya, and configuring internal startup behaviors.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (sys), pymel submodules, maya.cmds, and internal startup modules; potential data sources include the environment and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident data sinks that transmit data over networks or perform destructive actions; the code mainly performs imports and configuration.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules, setting internal flags, configuring logging, and conditionally importing UI types based on batch mode, concluding with a startup finalize call.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution observed. The code performs standard library imports, conditional UI imports, and internal startup configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with future imports for compatibility, then imports sys and pymel, assigning the current module to a submodule attribute. It configures startup flags and logs internal import events. It conditionally imports UI types if not in batch mode, ensuring necessary modules are loaded. The code also ensures 'cmds' points to 'maya.cmds' for consistency. The structure follows typical initialization patterns for a complex library, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. All operations are standard setup procedures for a Maya scripting environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical initialization script for the pymel library in Maya, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard imports, configuration, and conditional UI setup, maintaining a focus on providing a scripting environment. No malware or malicious anomalies are detected.",
