  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign parser for Maya.env files, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2). The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."
