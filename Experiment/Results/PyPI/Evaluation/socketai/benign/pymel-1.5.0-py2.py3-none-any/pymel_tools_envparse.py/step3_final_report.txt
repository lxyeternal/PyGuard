{
  "purpose": "The code is a parser for Maya.env files that reads configuration lines, performs variable substitution, and updates environment variables and sys.path accordingly.",
  "sources": "File input (Maya.env), environment variables, and symbols for substitution",
  "sinks": "Environment variables (os.environ), sys.path modifications, warnings issued for syntax issues",
  "flows": "File input -> Lexer tokenization -> Variable substitution -> Environment variable updates and sys.path modifications",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; warnings are standard for parsing errors",
  "analysis": "The code uses ply.lex for lexical analysis with multiple states to parse Maya.env lines, handling variable assignments and substitutions. It reads from files, updates environment variables, and modifies sys.path. No code execution, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. Warnings are used for syntax issues, but do not indicate malicious intent. The logic is straightforward and aligns with standard configuration parsing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign parser for Maya.env files, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2). The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
