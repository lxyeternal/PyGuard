{
  "purpose": "This code provides module-level metadata, versioning, and import statements for a Python package related to Maya scripting, with no dynamic or external code execution.",
  "sources": "Import statements (__future__, future, standard_library), version and author variable definitions, comments",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process data or execute functions beyond imports and variable assignments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup code with no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for compatibility, version and author metadata definitions, and descriptive comments. There are no functions, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no handling of untrusted input. The code is standard for a Python package setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. All import modules are well-known, and the version string is constructed simply. The code's structure and content are typical for open-source project headers and setup modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores indicating zero malware, zero obfuscation, and zero security risk are accurate and appropriate.",
