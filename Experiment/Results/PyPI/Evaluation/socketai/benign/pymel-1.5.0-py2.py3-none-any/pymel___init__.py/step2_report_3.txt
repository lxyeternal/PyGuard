  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward setup and metadata module for the PyMEL library.\n- No external inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution are mentioned.\n- The code primarily involves import statements, versioning, and author metadata.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and logical consistency:\n- The code provided matches the descriptions: it only imports standard modules, defines version info, and contains comments.\n- No issues are present in the code that could lead to malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n- The reasoning in all reports is consistent and aligns with the code content.\n\n### Potential issues or points of concern:\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0; no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly set to 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Correctly set to 0; no security risks are apparent.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Since all reports agree and the code is benign, no adjustments are necessary.\n- The overall assessment is that this code is a typical, safe, open-source setup script with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured module setup with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and no changes are warranted.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n- Confirm the code's safety and benign nature.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed report or further analysis.",
