{
  "purpose": "The code is a Python module that provides an interface to enhance Maya scripting by organizing Maya commands into a more Pythonic structure.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library modules (__future__, future), and module-level variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The code mainly defines version and author information and imports modules, with no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily consists of standard license comments, descriptive comments, and module imports. It defines versioning information and author metadata, which are typical for a package. There are no functions, no user input handling, no network operations, or any suspicious code segments. The use of __future__ imports and the future package for compatibility is common and benign. Overall, the code appears to be a standard open-source package header with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign header and import section for an open-source Maya scripting library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The package seems intended for legitimate use in Python scripting for Maya, with no evidence of supply chain or malware threats.",
