  "purpose": "This code provides setup and documentation for the PyMEL library, which enhances Python scripting for Maya by organizing Maya commands into a more Pythonic structure.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ for compatibility, standard_library installation, and module-level variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or transmitted, and no untrusted data sources are used.",
  "flows": "The code primarily performs imports and variable assignments without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard library import and setup code for a Python module, with no signs of malicious intent. It imports future features, installs compatibility shims, and defines version and author info. No input handling, no data transmission, and no code execution based on external inputs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module initialization with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is typical for a Python package setup script, focusing on documentation and compatibility.",
