{
  "purpose": "Provide Python scripting support for Maya using the PyMEL library, facilitating more Pythonic and object-oriented interaction with Maya commands.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ for compatibility; standard_library installation; module-level variable assignments for versioning and authorship.",
  "sinks": "No identifiable sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, system compromise, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; the code primarily sets up module imports and defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; code mainly consists of imports, comments, and variable assignments with no dynamic execution or external data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard licensing comments, import statements aimed at ensuring compatibility across Python versions, and module-level metadata variables. There are no input sources, no data sinks, no dynamic code execution, nor external network interactions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or potential backdoors are present. The structure and content are consistent with typical open-source library setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign setup module for the PyMEL library, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a well-documented, standard library initialization script with no suspicious elements.",
