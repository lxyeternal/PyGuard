  "purpose": "Provide functions and constants for retrieving and comparing Maya version information.",
  "sources": "Reads version strings from Maya environment variables and API, and user input via maya.cmds.",
  "sinks": "None directly indicate data leaks or system effects; no untrusted data is used in critical operations.",
  "flows": "Version data is read from _MGlobal and user queries; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses regex parsing and environment querying; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected. The function flavor() relies on maya.cmds, which could potentially be misused if the environment is compromised, but by itself, it appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily retrieves Maya version info, compares versions, and interprets environment data. The parseVersionStr function uses regex to extract version numbers from strings. The version constants are static. The functions for flavor, isUnlimited, isComplete, isRenderNode, and isEval invoke maya.cmds, which is a standard Maya API; no untrusted inputs are processed maliciously. No obfuscation, code injection, or backdoors are detected. All operations are read-only or straightforward API calls. The use of regex and environment data could be exploited if external input is fed into the version parsing functions, but these functions are used internally with fixed string patterns, not external untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for Maya version detection and comparison. It does not contain malicious behavior or maliciously intended code. No malware signals detected, and security risks are minimal. The use of maya.cmds is expected in Maya scripts, and no malicious actions are apparent from the code.",
