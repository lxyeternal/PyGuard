{
  "purpose": "Provides functions and constants to get and compare Maya versions, including parsing version strings and detecting system architecture.",
  "sources": "Uses _MGlobal.apiVersion() and _MGlobal.mayaVersion() from maya.OpenMaya for version info; reads version strings and system architecture.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, no untrusted data sinks observed that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, only internal function calls and version parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected. The code relies heavily on Maya's API for version info and performs standard parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines constants, parses version strings, and retrieves system information using Maya's API. It imports 're' and 'struct' modules, which are standard and safe. The functions parse version strings and determine system architecture, with no dynamic code execution or external network communication. The flavor() and isUnlimited(), isComplete(), isRenderNode(), isEval() functions invoke Maya commands, which are legitimate API calls for Maya environment info. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident; all code functions serve standard version detection purposes. There are no signs of backdoors, hidden data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility module for Maya version detection, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It relies on Maya's API and standard Python modules. No malicious behavior or supply chain threats are present.",
