  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, the context, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a utility for Maya version detection, relying on `_MGlobal.apiVersion()` and `_MGlobal.mayaVersion()`.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks or flows are identified; the code only reads data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is standard, relying on Maya's API.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully benign, with high confidence.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)  \n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on API calls and regex parsing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious flows; standard API usage.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Straightforward parsing and API calls, no obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent, high confidence.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0 (appropriate)  \n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; no suspicious sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data exfiltration or malicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, very high confidence.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data flow or external communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, high confidence.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same, with mention of querying Maya environment.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No leaks or malicious flows; standard API usage.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) due to reliance on `maya.cmds`, which could be misused if environment is compromised, but this is standard in Maya scripting.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior, just cautious.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2 (reasonable given environment dependency)\n\n**Verdict:** The security risk score is slightly elevated but justified. No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, no obfuscation or hidden code.\n- **Risk Score:** Most are 0, with Report 5's 0.2 being reasonable given reliance on Maya's API, which could be manipulated in a compromised environment, but the code itself is safe.\n\n### **My Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for environment dependency in some functions, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign utility module for Maya version detection. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned are reasonable and align with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The scores across all reports are appropriate, and no changes are necessary. The overall security posture of this code is very high, with negligible risk.",
