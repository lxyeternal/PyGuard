{
  "purpose": "Provides functions and constants for retrieving and comparing Maya version information, including version parsing, environment detection, and feature checks.",
  "sources": "Reads Maya environment variables and API version through imported maya.OpenMaya and maya.cmds modules; uses regex to parse version strings.",
  "sinks": "Calls to maya.cmds.about() and other Maya API functions that may access environment or system info, but no untrusted data handling or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No evident data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily reads system and environment info to determine version and environment properties.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code patterns; it relies on standard Maya API functions, regex parsing for version strings, and straightforward comparisons. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines constants for Maya versions, utility functions for version parsing and environment detection, and wrappers for Maya API calls. The functions involve parsing version strings, checking system bitness, and querying Maya product features. There is no evidence of malicious code, code injection, or backdoors. All imported modules are legitimate for Maya scripting, and the code performs expected operations without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for Maya version management. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. The code uses safe practices and legitimate API calls, and no anomalies or backdoors are detected.",
