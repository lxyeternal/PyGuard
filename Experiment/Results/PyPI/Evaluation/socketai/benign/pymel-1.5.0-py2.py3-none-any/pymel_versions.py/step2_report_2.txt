  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes version parsing and system info functions; uses Maya API (`_MGlobal.apiVersion()`, `_MGlobal.mayaVersion()`).  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flows; functions are read-only, internal, and standard.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no external network activity. Uses standard modules (`re`, `struct`).  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility module for Maya version detection. No malicious behavior or supply chain risks.  \n- **Confidence:** 1, Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully benign, straightforward, no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, relies on Maya API and regex parsing.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** API calls (`maya.cmds.about()`) are standard; no data leaks or external transmissions.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscated code or malicious patterns; uses standard regex and API calls.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate version utility, no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.95, Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Also benign, standard API usage, no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, uses Maya API and regex parsing.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flows; only internal info retrieval.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no external communication.  \n- **Conclusion:** Utility module for Maya version info, safe and standard.  \n- **Confidence:** 1, Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Clear benign code, no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, with API calls and regex parsing.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or external effects.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, standard API calls.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe utility code, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Confidence:** 1, Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully benign, standard usage.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with API calls and regex parsing.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or external communication.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), mentions that `maya.cmds` could be misused if environment compromised, but this is standard in Maya scripting.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly elevated, but still minimal.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just standard Maya API usage.  \n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher concern due to reliance on Maya commands, but overall still safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code Content & Behavior:** All reports confirm that the code is a version utility module for Maya, primarily performing version parsing, comparison, and environment queries.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious payloads across all reports.  \n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** The only minor concern is the use of `maya.cmds.about()` and similar functions, which could theoretically be manipulated if the Maya environment is compromised, but this is standard practice and not inherently malicious.  \n- **Supply Chain Risks:** No external network activity, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration observed.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment & Scores:**\n\n| Aspect                     | Justification                                                                                 | Estimated Score |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Malware**               | No malicious code, payload, or suspicious patterns detected.                              | **0**           |\n| **Obfuscated**            | Code is clear, uses standard modules, no obfuscation or hidden logic.                     | **0**           |\n| **Risk**                  | No external data leaks, no code injection, no malicious API misuse beyond standard API calls. The only minor concern is reliance on Maya's API, which is expected and controlled in the environment. | **0.1** (very low) |\n\n**Note:** The slight risk score (0.1) reflects that the code interacts with Maya's API, which could be compromised if the environment is malicious, but this is a standard and controlled aspect of Maya scripting.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThe code is a benign, standard utility for Maya version detection, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is safe and appropriate for supply chain use in Maya environments.",
