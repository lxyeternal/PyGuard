{
  "purpose": "Provides functions and constants for identifying and comparing Maya versions, including parsing version strings and retrieving version-related information.",
  "sources": "Reads from the external Maya API via 'maya.OpenMaya' (specifically '_MGlobal.apiVersion()' and '_MGlobal.mayaVersion()'), and user environment (via regex parsing of version strings).",
  "sinks": "Potentially uses 'maya.cmds.about()' for retrieving product information; this is an API call that could be manipulated if the environment is compromised, but it is standard practice and controlled by Maya.",
  "flows": "Version data flows from 'maya.OpenMaya' API calls and regex parsing; 'maya.cmds.about()' provides product info; no untrusted input flows directly into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code or malicious control flow present. The regex parsing in 'parseVersionStr' handles various formats but is straightforward. The use of 'try-except' around Maya API calls is standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily offers version parsing, comparison constants, and environment detection functions based on Maya's API. It relies on well-known Maya API functions and standard regex parsing. No malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors is evident. The functions are read-only and relate solely to version information, with no data manipulation or external communication. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for Maya version management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version utility for Maya, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It uses documented APIs and normal parsing techniques. The likelihood of malicious behavior is very low.",
