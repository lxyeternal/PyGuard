{
  "purpose": "Provides functions and constants for retrieving and comparing Maya software versions, including parsing version strings and identifying the Maya environment.",
  "sources": "Reads version strings from system and Maya API (_MGlobal.apiVersion(), _MGlobal.mayaVersion()), and user environment via maya.cmds.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data such as Maya version information and environment details could be accessed but not explicitly leaked or transmitted within this code.",
  "flows": "Version information is obtained from Maya API calls and parsed; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks or external transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and relies on standard API calls and regex parsing; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines version constants, utility functions for parsing version strings, and API wrappers for Maya environment queries. It uses Maya's API (via _MGlobal) to get version info and environment details, then processes and exposes this data. There are no dynamic code executions, external network calls, or backdoors. All functions and variables serve informational purposes. The regex for parsing version strings appears normal. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for Maya version handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include or invoke any suspicious or harmful operations, nor does it handle untrusted data in a dangerous manner.",
