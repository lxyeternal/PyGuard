{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for retrieving and comparing Maya version information, including parsing version strings and querying environment details via Maya's API.",
  "sources": "Reads data from Maya's API functions such as _MGlobal.apiVersion() and _MGlobal.mayaVersion(), and uses standard Python modules (re, struct).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or data transmission; purely internal API calls and data parsing.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from Maya API; processes data with regex; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module for Maya version detection, relying on Maya's API and standard Python modules. It performs version parsing, comparison, and environment queries without external communication or obfuscated logic. All functions are read-only and intended for internal use within Maya scripting environments. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for Maya version detection and environment querying. It does not contain malicious payloads, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible (approximately 0.1), justified by its reliance on Maya's API which is expected in this context.",
