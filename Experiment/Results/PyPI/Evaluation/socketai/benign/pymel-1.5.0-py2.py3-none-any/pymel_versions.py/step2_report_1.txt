  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Provides functions/constants for Maya version detection; uses _MGlobal API and regex parsing; no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The code is a benign utility module. It relies on Maya's API and standard Python modules, with no signs of malicious behavior. The logic is straightforward, and no external network or untrusted input handling is involved.\n\n**Conclusion:** No security issues or malware risk. The score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on version parsing and Maya API calls; no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard API calls, regex parsing, and version constants. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, focusing on version info retrieval and parsing; no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, using documented Maya API functions and regex parsing. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are consistent; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions; no suspicious code or external communication.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard version utility, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on retrieving and comparing Maya versions; uses maya.cmds and regex parsing.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (slightly elevated due to reliance on maya.cmds, which could be misused if environment is compromised)\n- **Assessment:** The code is primarily read-only and relies on legitimate Maya APIs. The minor security risk score reflects that invoking maya.cmds could be sensitive if environment is compromised, but this is standard in Maya scripting.\n\n**Conclusion:** The malware score is 0, which is appropriate. The security risk score of 0.2 is justified but still low, considering the context.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Scores:** Most are 0 or very low (0.2), justified given the code's purpose and safe API usage.\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is straightforward and safe.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation or hidden malicious intent:** None.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, readable code.\n- **Risk:** 0 — minimal security risk; standard API usage.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a safe, standard utility module for Maya version detection, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code, and very low security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The only slight concern is the reliance on maya.cmds, which could be misused if the environment is compromised, but this is typical in Maya scripting and does not indicate malicious intent in this context.",
