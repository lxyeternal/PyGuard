  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for Maya version detection and environment querying. It does not contain malicious payloads, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible (approximately 0.1), justified by its reliance on Maya's API which is expected in this context."
