  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration and utility setup for Maya-IPython integration, with no active malicious payloads or sabotage. The primary security concern is the use of eval() within completion routines, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. Overall, the code is safe in a trusted environment, but eval() usage warrants cautious handling. The malware score is low (~0.2), and the security risk is moderate (~0.3), reflecting the eval() concern without evidence of malicious activity."
