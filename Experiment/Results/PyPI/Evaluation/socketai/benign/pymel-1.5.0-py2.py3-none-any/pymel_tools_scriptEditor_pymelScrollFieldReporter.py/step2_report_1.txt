  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential security concerns, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is an experimental Maya plugin intercepting command outputs, converting MEL to Python, and displaying logs in a UI scroll field. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, considering it's a debugging/logging tool.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence based on detailed reasoning.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent. The code is a legitimate Maya plugin with no malicious intent. The low risk score and malware score are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing command interception, MEL-to-Python conversion, and UI display. No external network activity or exfiltration is observed.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, justified by the nature of the tool.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent. The analysis correctly states that the plugin is for command logging and filtering, with no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on command capturing, filtering, MEL-to-Python conversion, and UI updating. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's purpose. No security issues identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others—intercepting command output, filtering, MEL-to-Python conversion, UI display. No malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent. The code is a legitimate Maya plugin.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code intercepts command output, filters, and displays in UI. No external communication or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code is a standard Maya plugin for command interception and UI display, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports, correct given the code clarity.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low (0.1–0.2), consistent with the analysis—no external communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n**Risk:** 0.1 — very low, given the purpose and behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and appropriately score the code as benign. The code's purpose is to enhance Maya scripting workflows through command output filtering and MEL-to-Python conversion, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident.",
