  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for integrating Python functions into Maya's MEL environment. It employs dynamic code execution techniques that could be exploited if inputs are untrusted, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk scores are appropriate, and the overall security posture is acceptable with proper input validation."
