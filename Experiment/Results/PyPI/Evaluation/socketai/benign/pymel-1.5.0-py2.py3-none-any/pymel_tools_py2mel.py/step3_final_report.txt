  "purpose": "This code facilitates the conversion of Python callables into MEL procedures, enabling Python functions to be invoked within Maya's MEL environment through dynamic code generation and reflection.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments, string inputs for module and function names, and function signatures via inspection modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of eval and _mm.eval for executing generated MEL code, dynamic import of modules based on string inputs, and storage of function references in a global store.",
  "flows": "Sources such as string inputs and function objects flow into dynamic import and reflection functions, which then generate MEL code strings that are executed via eval, potentially leading to code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs dynamic import and eval without explicit validation or sanitization of inputs, which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted. No obfuscation or hidden malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses __import__ to load modules based on string inputs, and eval/_mm.eval to execute dynamically generated MEL code. While these techniques are common in bridging Python and MEL, they pose security risks if inputs are manipulated. The function _getFunction handles string-based module and function resolution, which could be exploited if user inputs are not sanitized. The overall structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk around 0.3-0.6) are consistent with the potential for injection or code execution vulnerabilities, especially if inputs are untrusted. Proper validation and sandboxing would mitigate these risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for integrating Python functions into Maya's MEL environment. It employs dynamic code execution techniques that could be exploited if inputs are untrusted, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk scores are appropriate, and the overall security posture is acceptable with proper input validation.",
