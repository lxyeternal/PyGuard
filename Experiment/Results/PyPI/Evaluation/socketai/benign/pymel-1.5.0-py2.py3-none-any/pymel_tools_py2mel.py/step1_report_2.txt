  "purpose": "The code converts Python callables into MEL procedures and creates MEL commands from Python functions or classes, enabling interaction between MEL and Python within Maya.",
  "sources": "Module imports, function parameters, environment variables, and inspection of function signatures and attributes.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic code evaluation with '_mm.eval', importing modules dynamically, accessing and calling functions via stored references, and executing Python code via 'python()' in generated MEL scripts.",
  "flows": "Function _getFunction retrieves functions from strings or objects; 'py2melProc' constructs MEL procedures that call Python functions using dynamic code strings; 'py2melCmd' creates MEL commands that invoke Python functions or class methods, passing arguments through MEL and Python interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'eval' to execute dynamically generated MEL code; importing modules and accessing functions based on string input; storing function references in a global dictionary '_functionStore' and calling them via 'python()' inside MEL code; reliance on 'repr' for function key storage which may lead to collision or inconsistencies; no explicit sanitization or validation of string inputs used in 'eval' or code strings; use of 'import' with dynamic module names that could potentially be manipulated; minimal error handling around dynamic imports and execution.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically imports modules and retrieves functions based on string inputs, then generates MEL procedures and commands that internally execute Python functions using string-based code execution ('python()') calls. It stores function references in a global dictionary and uses 'repr' for identification. The code uses 'eval' to run MEL code that includes Python module imports and function calls, which could be exploited if malicious strings are injected. While the primary functionality appears to be code generation for legitimate inter-language calls, the use of dynamic imports, code generation, and 'eval' without sanitization introduces potential for malicious exploitation if inputs are manipulated, especially in environments where untrusted inputs can influence function names or code strings.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily provides a bridge between Python and MEL, enabling script and function registration. However, it employs dynamic code execution and module importing based on string inputs without explicit validation or sanitization, which could be exploited for malicious purposes if inputs are compromised. No explicit malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or backdoors is present, but the methods used pose security risks if misused.",
