      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for Maya version detection and environment querying. It does not contain malicious payloads, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible (approximately 0.1), justified by its reliance on Maya's API which is expected in this context."

      "conclusion": "The code is standard for Maya environment management, with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary risk stems from executing external scripts, which should be trusted. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is absent, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3). The reports' assessments are accurate and justified."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for integrating Python functions into Maya's MEL environment. It employs dynamic code execution techniques that could be exploited if inputs are untrusted, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk scores are appropriate, and the overall security posture is acceptable with proper input validation."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The reassignment of 'str' is unusual but harmless in this context. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a configuration and utility setup for Maya-IPython integration, with no active malicious payloads or sabotage. The primary security concern is the use of eval() within completion routines, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. Overall, the code is safe in a trusted environment, but eval() usage warrants cautious handling. The malware score is low (~0.2), and the security risk is moderate (~0.3), reflecting the eval() concern without evidence of malicious activity."
