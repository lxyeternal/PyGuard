{
  "purpose": "Provides documentation and imports for pymel tool modules related to extensions and integrations.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ and builtins modules, specifically the 'str' built-in.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data processing or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flows from sources to sinks; code mainly imports and variable reassignment.",
  "anomalies": "Reassignment of 'str' from __builtins__, which can be used to override the default string type. No other unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future statements for compatibility, imports all from builtins, and reassigns 'str' to __builtins__['str']. This redefinition could potentially be used to interfere with string handling, but by itself, it is not malicious. No external data inputs, network activities, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be setting up a module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily setup and documentation with no evident malicious behavior. The reassignment of 'str' is potentially suspicious but not harmful in context. No malware or security risks are apparent.",
