  "purpose": "Provides documentation and imports related to pymel extensions, tools, and integrations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, builtins, and the reassignment of the 'str' built-in.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; code primarily sets up future imports and reassigns 'str'.",
  "anomalies": "Reassignment of the 'str' built-in to potentially override or modify default behavior; no other unusual code or secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, then imports all builtins, and reassigns the 'str' built-in to the value of __builtins__['str']. This redefinition can be used to modify string behavior, but there is no evidence of malicious intent. The code appears to be preparatory or configuration code for a larger module. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly setting up future compatibility and reassigning a built-in. The reassignment of 'str' could be suspicious if used maliciously, but in this isolated snippet, it appears benign.",
