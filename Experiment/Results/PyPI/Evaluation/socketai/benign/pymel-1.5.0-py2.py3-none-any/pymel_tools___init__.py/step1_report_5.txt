{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be documentation or module description for pymel tools and imports future features and built-in functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ (print_function, division, absolute_import), import of builtins, and redefinition of 'str' from __builtins__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; no external inputs or outputs are present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code primarily sets up environment and redefines 'str'",
  "anomalies": "Redefinition of 'str' as __builtins__['str']' could be used to manipulate or mask standard string behavior, but is not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, imports the builtins module, and redefines the 'str' type to ensure it references the original built-in string type explicitly. There are no data input points, external communications, or suspicious operations. The redefinition of 'str' could be used for subtle behavior modifications, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious intent. The code primarily serves as setup or documentation, with no active malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, mainly setting environment and importing future features. The redefinition of 'str' is unusual but not malicious in context. No malware or security risks are present.",
