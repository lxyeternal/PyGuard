{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for managing doctest parts, including parsing, formatting, and validation of code snippets and expected output.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'xdoctest' modules, class attributes, and string data within methods.",
  "sinks": "Validation function 'checker.check_got_vs_want', formatting functions 'utils.highlight_code' and 'utils.color_text', and directive extraction.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source lines through validation and formatting functions within class methods; no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a testing utility class, managing parsing, formatting, and validation of doctest parts. It relies on external modules for validation and formatting, which are standard for such frameworks. No network activity, file operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The functions and attributes are used as intended for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate component of a testing framework with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard string processing, validation, and formatting without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
