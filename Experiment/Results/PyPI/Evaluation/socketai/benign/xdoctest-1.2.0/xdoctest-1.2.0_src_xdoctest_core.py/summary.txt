  "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for extracting and analyzing doctests from Python docstrings. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The minor risk associated with debug info exposure is typical and acceptable in development contexts. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use in supply chain contexts."
