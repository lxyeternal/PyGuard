  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, data flows, potential sinks, anomalies, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code extracts doctests from docstrings in various styles, supporting static/dynamic analysis.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses warnings, print statements, and exception handling, primarily for debugging and error reporting.\n- **Anomalies & Security:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no malicious code. Warnings/prints could leak internal info but are standard for debugging.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; it’s a legitimate testing utility.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.2 (low, mainly informational/debugging info)  \n**Confidence:** 0.9\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on extracting and parsing doctests from docstrings, with support for multiple styles.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network, file, or system modifications; warnings and exceptions are used for error handling.\n- **Anomalies & Security:** No backdoors, secrets, or obfuscated code. It relies on standard parsing and analysis routines.\n- **Conclusion:** Secure, standard testing framework component.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.2  \n**Confidence:** 0.9\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Parses, analyzes, and extracts doctests, with multiple styles and static/dynamic analysis.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses warnings, exceptions, and module imports; no network or data exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies & Security:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses standard practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure utility for test extraction.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 (very low)  \n**Confidence:** 0.95\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, focusing on parsing and analyzing modules and docstrings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No harmful system calls, network, or data leaks; primarily internal processing.\n- **Anomalies & Security:** No malicious code or obfuscation detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe component for testing purposes.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.2  \n**Confidence:** 1\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, functions for parsing and analyzing docstrings/modules, with static/dynamic analysis.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or system modifications; mainly warnings and internal processing.\n- **Anomalies & Security:** No suspicious activity, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure testing utility.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.2  \n**Confidence:** 0.95\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports indicate no malicious code, network activity, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; code appears clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero mainly due to warnings and exception handling revealing internal info, but this is typical for debugging and error reporting in such tools.\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no signs of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (code is transparent)\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (low, mostly related to debug info leakage, not active threats)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for extracting and parsing doctests from Python source code. It does not exhibit any malicious or obfuscated behavior, and the security risk is minimal, primarily related to internal info leaks during error reporting.",
