  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and consistency with the provided source.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a well-structured utility for parsing doctests from docstrings, supporting multiple styles and analysis modes. It uses warnings and print statements mainly for debugging and error reporting. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The functions handle inputs securely, with exception handling that reports errors without executing untrusted code.\n  - The use of warnings and print statements is standard for debugging, not malicious.\n  - No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n  - The dynamic analysis functions are invoked only on modules, not on untrusted sources directly.\n  - Risks are minimal; internal state info could be exposed via warnings, but this is typical.\n\n- **Malware / Obfuscated / Risk scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (low, mostly due to debug info exposure)\n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected. The code appears secure and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the extraction and parsing of doctests, with careful handling of sources and errors. No malicious code detected.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code relies on standard modules and practices.\n  - No network activity, code injection, or backdoors.\n  - Warnings and exception handling are standard.\n  - Dynamic analysis is invoked only on modules, not on untrusted data.\n\n- **Malware / Obfuscated / Risk scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** Secure, legitimate, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Functions for parsing and analyzing docstrings, with no suspicious patterns or malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Uses standard Python practices.\n  - No hardcoded credentials or obfuscation.\n  - Error handling is appropriate.\n  - No network or file system operations with untrusted data.\n\n- **Malware / Obfuscated / Risk scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (very low)\n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious activity; code is a typical testing utility.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Functions for parsing, analyzing, and extracting doctests, with safe use of import and analysis routines.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No signs of malicious code or data exfiltration.\n  - Uses dynamic import and analysis in a controlled manner.\n  - No suspicious network or system calls.\n  - Warnings and exceptions are standard.\n\n- **Malware / Obfuscated / Risk scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure, with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, a safe and standard implementation for parsing docstrings and modules.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No evidence of malicious activity.\n  - No obfuscation or backdoors.\n  - Uses standard exception handling and warnings.\n  - No network or system harm routines.\n\n- **Malware / Obfuscated / Risk scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, secure utility for testing.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code. The code only performs parsing, analysis, and test extraction, with no network, file system, or code execution outside controlled parsing routines.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation or misleading variable names are present.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero mainly due to debug info exposure via warnings/print statements, which is typical in development tools but should be reviewed for production environments.\n\n- **Overall:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured testing utility with no signs of supply chain or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to debug/info exposure, not malicious intent)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
