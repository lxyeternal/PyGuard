{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for parsing, extracting, and analyzing doctests from Python docstrings in various styles, supporting static and dynamic analysis modes to facilitate testing and documentation validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from docstrings, module files, and modules themselves; it also accesses configuration via sys.argv and uses warnings and print statements for debugging and error reporting.",
  "sinks": "Uses warnings, print statements, and exception handling; no network, file system modifications, or malicious data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Sources include docstrings and modules; flows lead to parsing routines, error handling, and warnings; no malicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns; standard use of warnings and print statements for debugging, which could leak internal info but are typical in development tools.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard parsing techniques for extracting doctests, with careful error handling and support for multiple styles. It performs static and dynamic analysis in a controlled manner, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The use of warnings and print statements is typical for debugging and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or backdoors are present. The code's structure and behavior align with legitimate testing utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for extracting and analyzing doctests from Python docstrings. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The minor risk associated with debug info exposure is typical and acceptable in development contexts. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use in supply chain contexts.",
