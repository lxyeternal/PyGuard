{
  "purpose": "The code provides static analysis tools for Python source code, including parsing, extracting docstrings, verifying balanced statements, and identifying function/method definitions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'source' string (Python code passed directly or read from files), 'lines' from source split into lines, and AST nodes during traversal.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the 'ast.parse' function, regex substitutions, and tokenization, which process source code or strings. No data is sent over networks or used maliciously within the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input source (file or string) through tokenization or AST parsing, into various functions for analysis, with no external or untrusted data influence beyond reading files and processing static code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no apparent hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code performs static code analysis without executing untrusted code or network activity. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely performs static analysis tasks: parsing source code, extracting docstrings, checking for balanced statements, and listing modules. It uses standard Python modules like 'ast' and 'tokenize' safely. There are no indications of data exfiltration, system disruption, or malicious behavior. The functions are well-structured and intended for analysis rather than execution of untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a static analysis utility that analyzes Python source code for structure, docstrings, and balance; it does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
