{
  "purpose": "This module performs static analysis of Python source code to extract function definitions, docstrings, and static variable values, and to analyze code structure for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads source code from strings, files, and AST nodes; extracts docstrings, comments, and static variable values.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input directly or output untrusted data. Tokenize and parse functions are used for analysis, not for executing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "Reads source data, parses into AST, extracts docstrings, comments, static values, and analyzes code structure without executing external commands or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of AST and tokenization appears standard for static analysis. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or file modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs static source code parsing, comment extraction, and static value retrieval using standard libraries (ast, tokenize). It includes handling of multiline docstrings, balanced statement checks, and package module path enumeration, all via safe static analysis techniques. No code injection, dynamic execution, or external communications are detected. The functions do not process untrusted input beyond parsing and analysis, nor do they perform any malicious activity such as data theft or system modification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static analysis utility that parses Python source files to extract structural information without executing code or performing any side effects. It exhibits no malicious behavior or sabotage. Its purpose is to facilitate source code introspection for testing and documentation purposes, with no suspicious or harmful patterns detected.",
