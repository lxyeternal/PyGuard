{
  "purpose": "The code provides static analysis utilities for Python source files, including parsing ASTs, extracting docstrings, comments, static variable values, and analyzing code structure such as balanced statements and module paths.",
  "sources": "Reads source code from strings or files, uses ast.parse, tokenize.generate_tokens, and regex to analyze code components without executing or modifying code.",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs read-only analysis without external effects, data transmission, or code execution.",
  "flows": "Source input (source code or files) flows through parsing and tokenization functions, with data extracted into internal structures (e.g., AST nodes, docstrings, static values). No untrusted data is sent to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code is standard for static analysis tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs static source code parsing and analysis using standard Python libraries. It handles multiple Python versions, extracts docstrings, checks code balance, and static variable values. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is involved. The functions are well-structured, documented, and include safeguards for edge cases like multiline docstrings. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero, given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a safe, standard static analysis utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
