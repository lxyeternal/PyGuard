{
  "purpose": "This code performs static analysis of Python source files, parsing AST to identify function, class, and module definitions, extracting docstrings, and analyzing code structure for testing and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads source code from strings or files, and tokenizes code to identify comments and structural elements.",
  "sinks": "Uses tokenization and AST parsing; no evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Source code is tokenized and parsed into an AST; static values are extracted from AST nodes; code structure is analyzed for docstrings and definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are present. The code includes standard static analysis functions with typical usage. No suspicious network or system interactions are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard static analysis utilities: parsing source code into AST, extracting docstrings, analyzing balanced code statements, extracting comments, and finding module/submodule paths. No functions invoke external commands, network, or perform operations that could harm or exfiltrate data. The functions work purely on source text and AST trees, with no dynamic execution or malicious payloads. No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The logic is consistent with open-source static analysis tools. The code includes deprecation warnings and environment-aware parsing, but these are benign and typical for a compatible static analysis library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical static analysis utility library with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It performs source code parsing, comment extraction, and structural analysis securely. There are no suspicious network activities, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads detected.",
