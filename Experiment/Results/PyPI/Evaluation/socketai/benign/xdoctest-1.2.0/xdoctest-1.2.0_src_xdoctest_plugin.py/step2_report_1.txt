  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security implications, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a pytest plugin integrating xdoctest, involving monkey patching to disable the default pytest doctest plugin. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware or malicious activity identified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to monkey patching which could disrupt pytest behavior but isn't malicious.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code. The monkey patching is intrusive but intended for plugin functionality, not malicious intent. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the monkey patching to disable default doctest collection. No malicious behavior observed.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — consistent with the previous report, considering the intrusive monkey patching.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is a plugin that modifies pytest internals for xdoctest. No malicious activity, just unusual internal modifications. The score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** The code disables pytest's default doctest collection via monkey patching, reading files, and parsing docstrings. The report notes suspicious monkey patching but finds no malware.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.4 — slightly higher, acknowledging that monkey patching and file reading could be exploited if test files are malicious.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe higher risk score reflects the potential for misuse if malicious test files are provided, but there's no evidence of malicious code. The assessment is cautious but justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with focus on monkey patching to disable pytest's default behavior. No malware or malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — consistent with prior low risk assessments.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is a legitimate plugin extension, with intrusive but non-malicious monkey patching. The score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** The code modifies pytest internals to support xdoctest, disables default collection via monkey patching, with no malicious behavior. No data exfiltration or network activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is a straightforward plugin with internal modifications for functionality. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0. The code does not contain any network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.4 in reports, justified by the monkey patching that alters pytest's default behavior. Given that the monkey patching could potentially be exploited if test files are malicious, a conservative risk score of around **0.2** to **0.4** is reasonable.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — moderate, due to the monkey patching which could interfere with pytest's normal operation but is not inherently malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate pytest plugin designed to enhance doctest handling with xdoctest. Its modifications, while intrusive, serve a functional purpose and do not constitute malware. The risk is primarily from the potential disruption of pytest's default behavior if misused, but no malicious intent or activity is evident.",
