  "purpose": "The code is designed to run pytest with specific arguments for testing and coverage reporting of a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments from sys.argv[1:], and hardcoded package and directory names.",
  "targets": "The code executes pytest.main with constructed arguments, which can run tests and generate reports.",
  "flows": "User provides additional command-line arguments -> sys.argv is combined with predefined args -> pytest.main executes these arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Usage of pytest and sys.argv is standard for test scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily prepares and runs pytest with specific options for a testing setup. It includes standard imports and argument handling. No suspicious behavior, malicious commands, or data leaks are evident. It does not perform network operations, access sensitive data, or execute untrusted code beyond what pytest might do. The code structure and content are typical for a test runner script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard test invocation script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply runs pytest with specified options and user-provided arguments.",
