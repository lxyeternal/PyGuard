  "purpose": "A simple Python script that runs pytest with coverage and reporting options, passing through user arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1:] which includes command-line arguments provided by the user.",
  "sinks": "pytest.main() execution, which runs tests based on constructed arguments.",
  "flows": "User input from sys.argv flows into pytest arguments, which are then used to execute pytest.main().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward. The only notable aspect is passing untrusted input directly into pytest arguments, which is standard for test scripts but could be risky if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a list of pytest arguments, including coverage and report options, appends any user-supplied arguments, and executes pytest.main() with these arguments. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is clear and standard for a test runner. The primary concern is the potential misuse of untrusted input via command-line arguments, but this is typical in testing environments. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard test runner with no malicious intent or behavior. The low security risk score reflects minimal potential for misuse if inputs are untrusted, but this is common for such scripts. No modifications are necessary.",
