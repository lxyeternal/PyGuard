{
  "purpose": "The code is a static parser designed to extract, label, group, and analyze doctest snippets from Python docstrings, utilizing AST parsing, regex, and tokenization for syntax validation and line analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads source strings and lines within methods such as _label_docsrc_lines and _locate_ps1_linenos, including input strings, source lines, and line iterators.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data flows, network connections, file operations, or system modifications; the code performs internal static analysis only.",
  "flows": "Source data (input strings and lines) are parsed into AST, tokenized, and analyzed for syntax correctness, with line labeling and grouping to produce doctest parts without executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. The only noteworthy element is the workaround for Python bug 16806, which is a documented, benign fix.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard static analysis techniques, including AST parsing, regex for indentation, tokenization for syntax validation, and line labeling. It handles Python version-specific bugs with documented workarounds. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is detected. Exception handling and debugging logs are for development purposes. The logic is clear, purpose-driven, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured static parser for extracting and analyzing doctest snippets from Python docstrings. It contains no malicious or obfuscated components, performs only internal syntax validation, and employs documented workarounds for known Python bugs. Its security risk is negligible.",
