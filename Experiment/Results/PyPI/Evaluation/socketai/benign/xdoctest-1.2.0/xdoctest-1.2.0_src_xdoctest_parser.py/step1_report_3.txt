{
  "purpose": "The code provides a parser for extracting and processing doctest parts from Python docstrings, including labeling lines, grouping code and text, and handling various doctest formats.",
  "sources": "Reads input from string arguments, docstring data, and source code lines; uses sys.version_info to handle compatibility; reads code through AST parsing and tokenization; examines lines for PS1/PS2 prefixes and directives.",
  "sinks": "Uses ast.parse and tokenize.generate_tokens which are standard and safe; no untrusted data sinks for external systems or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Input string is processed to identify code vs text, then labeled lines are grouped into executable or display parts; code lines are parsed with AST, line numbers are adjusted for Python version issues, and doctest parts are yielded for execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code performs standard parsing and grouping of Python code snippets; no unusual dynamic execution or obfuscation detected. Workarounds for known Python bugs are correctly documented and do not introduce malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code extensively uses standard Python libraries (ast, tokenize, sys, re) for parsing and analyzing source code snippets; it implements logic to handle different doctest formats, line indentation, and special cases like Python bug 16806. It performs line-based analysis and syntax validation without executing untrusted code or data. No code injection points or network activities are present. The logic is aligned with standard static analysis for doctest parsing, with no suspicious side effects or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This source code functions as a static parser for Python doctest snippets, correctly handling line labeling, grouping, syntax validation, and compatibility issues. There is no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. The code adheres to safe static analysis practices and does not perform any harmful operations.",
