  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code and the context.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a setup script for a Python package, performing version extraction, requirements parsing, and package configuration.\n- All reports conclude that the code is standard, safe, and performs no malicious actions.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present.\n- The code uses safe practices like static AST parsing for version info, and file existence checks.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes standard setup routines.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both correctly scored as 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 seems reasonable given no vulnerabilities.\n- **Analysis:** Well-founded; no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0, matching the absence of malicious code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 is appropriate.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies static parsing and safe practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0, consistent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, fitting.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; standard setup code.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Analysis:** Well justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; **malware = 0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, static parsing, no obfuscation; **obfuscated = 0**.\n- **Risk Score:** The overall risk is minimal; the highest is 0.2, which is reasonable.\n\n**Given the thorough static analysis and absence of any suspicious or malicious patterns, I agree with the provided scores.**\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear, standard, and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** **0.1–0.2** — very low, due to the nature of setup scripts, which are inherently safe.\n\n**Final note:** No supply chain attack vectors or malicious intent are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured setup routine.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. No adjustments needed.",
