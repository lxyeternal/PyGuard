  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a setup routine parsing version, dependencies, and metadata.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks or data flows, only file reads.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code uses standard static parsing (`ast`) for version extraction, safe file reading, and dependency parsing. No suspicious patterns, code injection, or dynamic execution.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-reasoned; high confidence (0.9). No malware, obfuscation, or security risks identified.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low risk, typical setup script).\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate; the code is a legitimate setup script with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the script as parsing version info and dependencies from files.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processed into system calls or network activity.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Static AST parsing for version info is safe. No code execution or obfuscation. The dependency parsing is straightforward.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate; high confidence (0.9). No malware or security issues.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (minimal).\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the script as benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, correctly noting the script's role.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** File reads and parsing, no external or untrusted data handling.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no secrets. Uses safe static parsing.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate; very high confidence (1).  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the script reads metadata and dependencies for packaging.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external system calls.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, code injection, or dynamic execution. Uses safe static parsing.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded; high confidence (1).  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the script's role in packaging.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data flows.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation, static parsing is safe.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate; high confidence (1).  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation & Final Scores**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0; no obfuscation or hidden code detected.  \n- **Risk Score:** Very low, given the nature of the code; all reports assign 0. The only slightly higher score (0.2) in report 1 is justified as a very minimal risk, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n### **My Final Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.  \n- **Security Risk:** **0** — Standard setup script, no vulnerabilities or attack vectors.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package. It employs safe static parsing, reads files securely, and performs no suspicious operations. The reports are consistent and accurate. No evidence suggests any supply chain or security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code appears safe and benign.",
