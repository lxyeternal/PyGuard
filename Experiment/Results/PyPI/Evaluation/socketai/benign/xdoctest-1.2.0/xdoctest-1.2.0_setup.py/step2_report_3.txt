  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code to verify the claims, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup routine with no malicious behavior, performing safe file reads, static AST parsing for version extraction, and dependency parsing. No network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code reads files (`__init__.py`, requirements, README) and parses version info using `ast`, which is safe.\n  - No external code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n  - No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n- **Verdict:** The analysis is accurate. The reported \"malware\" score of 0 is justified, and \"obfuscated\" is 0. The overall security risk is low (~0.2), given the standard nature of setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static parsing, safe file reads, and no dynamic code execution or network activity. The AST parsing for version info is a safe practice.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code reads static files and uses AST for version extraction, avoiding code execution.\n  - No untrusted data processing or external communications.\n  - No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Verdict:** The analysis aligns well with the code. Malware score remains 0; obfuscated is 0; security risk is minimal (~0.1).\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script reads static files, parses version and dependencies, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code uses safe, static parsing methods.\n  - No network or external data processing.\n  - No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion is justified. Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script reads files, parses dependencies, and sets up package metadata without any malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - All file reads are static, with no dynamic code execution.\n  - Uses safe parsing methods.\n  - No external network activity or secret data handling.\n\n- **Verdict:** The analysis is accurate. Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script performs standard setup tasks, with safe file existence checks, static parsing, and no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code reads files and parses data without executing untrusted code.\n  - No network activity or data leaks.\n  - No obfuscation or hidden malicious logic.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's assessment is consistent with the code. Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is very low (~0).\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not contain any malicious payloads, code injection, or obfuscated code. It performs standard setup tasks safely.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is clear, uses straightforward static parsing, and contains no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of malicious activity, external network communication, or sensitive data handling, a low risk score (~0.1-0.2) is appropriate. The reports' scores of 0.1-0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Security Risk Score:** **0.1** (minimal, standard setup script with no evident vulnerabilities)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical, well-structured setup script that safely reads files, parses version info, and constructs package metadata. No signs of supply chain attacks, malware, or obfuscation are present. The low security risk score reflects its benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** All reports are consistent with the code's actual behavior. The overall assessment confirms the script's safety and legitimacy.",
