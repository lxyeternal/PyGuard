{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, used to parse version, requirements, and metadata for package installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads files such as __init__.py, README.rst, and various requirements.txt files; reads package files for version and description.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to untrusted data effect; primarily file I/O and string parsing.",
  "flows": "Reads static data from files; parses and processes requirement specifications and version info; constructs setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis of files to extract package metadata, requirements, and version info using safe file reads and parsing via the AST module. No untrusted input sources are processed; no data is sent over networks or written to system files. It primarily manages package setup parameters. No suspicious patterns such as code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is well-structured for a setup script, with no signs of tampering or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, well-structured setup configuration file with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles package metadata and requirements parsing securely, without any malicious side effects.",
