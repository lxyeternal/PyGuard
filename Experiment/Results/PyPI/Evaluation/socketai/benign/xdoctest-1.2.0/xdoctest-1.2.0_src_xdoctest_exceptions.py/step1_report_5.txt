{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions related to xdoctest error handling and import pytest modules for testing framework integration.",
  "sources": "Import statements for _pytest and _pytest.outcomes; class definitions for exceptions; constructor in DoctestParseError.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data processing, network activity, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; exception definitions and imports do not facilitate data manipulation or exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except block to define dummy _pytest classes if import fails, which could be a fallback mechanism; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines exception classes to handle errors related to doctest parsing and execution. It imports _pytest modules for test integration, with a fallback dummy class if pytest isn't available. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The fallback dummy class might be used to avoid import errors in environments without pytest, which is benign.\n\nNo suspicious or malicious code, obfuscated code, or secret data handling present. The code is straightforward and intended for error handling and test framework compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of exception definitions with safe fallback import handling. No malicious behavior, security risks, or malware signals are present.",
