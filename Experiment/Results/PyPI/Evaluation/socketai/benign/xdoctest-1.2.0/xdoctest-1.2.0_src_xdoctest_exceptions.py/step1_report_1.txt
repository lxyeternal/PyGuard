  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in xdoctest.",
  "sources": "import statements for _pytest and _pytest.outcomes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sources present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; the code only defines exceptions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The only dynamic aspect is conditional import handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of exception class definitions and a conditional import for _pytest modules. No data input, output, or processing occurs beyond defining exception classes. The try-except block provides a fallback for missing pytest modules, which is standard and harmless. There is no indication of malicious activity, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and mainly used for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to define exception classes and manage optional dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
