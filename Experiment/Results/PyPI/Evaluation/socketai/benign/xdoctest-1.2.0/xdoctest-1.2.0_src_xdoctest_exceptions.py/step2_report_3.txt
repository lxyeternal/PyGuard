  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to assess the presence of issues, the correctness of the scoring, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is primarily defining custom exception classes for error handling.\n- It includes a conditional import of `_pytest` modules, with fallback dummy classes if pytest isn't available.\n- No untrusted data handling, external data sources, network activity, or data exfiltration is involved.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears standard, benign, and intended for internal error management and dependency handling.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** All describe the code as defining exception classes and handling optional imports—accurately reflecting the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows or external interactions are present.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All reports correctly state that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (full confidence) in each, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated scores:** 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0, as no security issues are present.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- The fallback dummy class for `_pytest` is a common pattern to ensure compatibility and does not introduce security risks.\n- The exception classes are standard and contain no malicious payload.\n- The import statements are safe, and the code does not process untrusted data.\n\n**Potential points of concern:**\n\n- The only slight concern could be the fallback dummy class, but it is implemented in a benign manner.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious code are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final scoring recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Note:** The original reports' scores align well with the analysis. The confidence levels are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign module defining exception classes and handling optional dependencies with fallback dummy classes. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment is consistent with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that such exception and import handling code remains free of hidden payloads or unintended side effects, but in this case, the code appears perfectly safe.",
