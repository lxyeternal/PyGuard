  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the xdoctest framework and manage optional dependency imports with fallback classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for _pytest and _pytest.outcomes modules, fallback class definitions for _pytest and outcomes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Conditional import flow; fallback class definitions used if _pytest is not available.",
  "anomalies": "Use of fallback dummy classes for optional dependencies; no malicious or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions and a conditional import for _pytest modules, with fallback dummy classes. There is no data processing, network activity, or external data handling. The fallback pattern is standard and benign. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The import fallback is a common pattern to ensure compatibility when pytest is not installed. The code is straightforward, serving as error handling infrastructure. No untrusted data sources or sinks are identified, and no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as error class definitions and dependency management with safe fallback patterns. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
