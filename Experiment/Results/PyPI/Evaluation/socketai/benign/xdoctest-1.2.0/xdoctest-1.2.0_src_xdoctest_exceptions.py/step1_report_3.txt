  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the xdoctest module.",
  "sources": "Import statements for _pytest and _pytest.outcomes modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks; exceptions are for internal control flow only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines custom exception classes with standard inheritance from Exception or SyntaxError. It conditionally defines dummy classes if pytest is unavailable, which is a common fallback pattern. There is no evidence of code injection, malicious behavior, or data exfiltration. The import of testing libraries does not pose security risks in this context, as it is contained within exception handling and fallback definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as error definitions and fallback mechanisms without any malicious intent or security concerns. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
