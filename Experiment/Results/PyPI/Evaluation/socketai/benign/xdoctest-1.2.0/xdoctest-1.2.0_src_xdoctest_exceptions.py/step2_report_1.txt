  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code consists solely of exception class definitions and a conditional import for _pytest modules.\n- The import fallback creates dummy classes if pytest isn't available.\n- No data input/output, network activity, or external data handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The fallback pattern is standard and benign.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with straightforward class definitions and no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very close to it; the highest is 0.1 in one report, which seems reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n\n- The only slightly higher risk score (0.1) is due to the fallback dummy class for _pytest, which is a common pattern and not risky.\n- No claims or evidence of vulnerabilities, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- The code is benign, serving as error handling infrastructure with optional dependency management.\n- No changes needed in the scoring.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.1 (to reflect the fallback import pattern, but it's benign)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate; no further concerns are identified.",
