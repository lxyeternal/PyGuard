{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the xdoctest framework, specifically related to docstring formatting, parsing, and event loop issues.",
  "sources": "The code imports _pytest and _pytest.outcomes modules if available.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data flows to untrusted or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines exceptions and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except to conditionally define a dummy class for _pytest if import fails is benign; no suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes for a testing framework and conditionally creates a dummy class if pytest is not installed. It does not perform any data handling, network communication, or system modification. The import handling appears to be standard and safe. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a safe, standard definition of exceptions with conditional import fallback. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present.",
