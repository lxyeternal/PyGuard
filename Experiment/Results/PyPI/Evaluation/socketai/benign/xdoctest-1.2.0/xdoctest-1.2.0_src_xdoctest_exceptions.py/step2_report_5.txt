  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of exception class definitions and a conditional import fallback for `_pytest`.\n- No untrusted data handling, network activity, or external system interaction is present.\n- The fallback dummy class for `_pytest` is a standard pattern to ensure compatibility if pytest isn't installed.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are identified.\n- The code is straightforward, serving error handling and dependency management purposes.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign a security risk score of 0, indicating no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** High confidence (mostly 1), indicating that the reviewers agree on the benign nature.\n\n**Potential Concerns or Discrepancies:**\n- The only minor variation is report 5's confidence score (0.9), possibly due to the fallback class pattern, but this is still considered safe.\n- No report suggests any suspicious behavior or assumptions that could be challenged.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, safe pattern for defining exceptions and handling optional dependencies.\n- No evidence supports any malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The scores assigned by all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code is benign, and the security posture is sound.",
