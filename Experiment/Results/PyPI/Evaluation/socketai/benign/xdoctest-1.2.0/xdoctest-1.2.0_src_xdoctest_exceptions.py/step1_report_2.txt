  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes used in xdoctest for error handling and control flow.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data; it only defines classes and imports modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no functions or operations that process external input or produce output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up exception classes and conditional imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes for error handling in the xdoctest framework. It includes a try-except block to conditionally import pytest modules, providing fallback dummy classes if pytest is unavailable. There are no indications of data manipulation, network activity, or malicious behavior. The structure and content are consistent with standard Python error class definitions and compatibility handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be purely functional, defining exceptions for error handling without any malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard patterns for exception class creation and conditional imports, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
