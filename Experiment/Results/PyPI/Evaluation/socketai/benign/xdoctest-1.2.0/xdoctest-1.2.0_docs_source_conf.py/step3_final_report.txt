{
  "purpose": "This code is a comprehensive Sphinx configuration script that sets up paths, extensions, version parsing, custom cross-reference resolution, docstring processing, figure generation, and static asset management for project documentation.",
  "sources": "Version parsing from source files, reading configuration files, importing modules, and processing docstrings and figures.",
  "sinks": "File copying operations for static assets and images, figure generation during doctest runs, and cross-references resolution.",
  "flows": "Sources include version files, source code, and docstrings; sinks include static asset directories, image files, and cross-reference nodes in documentation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder code ('...') and incomplete functions suggest ongoing development but do not indicate malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a complex but legitimate documentation setup involving version extraction, custom extensions, figure handling, and static asset management. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. File operations are standard for documentation pipelines. The placeholders and commented sections are typical during development. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and structure, reflecting a low security risk typical for such tooling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Sphinx configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. Its complexity is within normal bounds for advanced documentation workflows, and no security threats are evident.",
