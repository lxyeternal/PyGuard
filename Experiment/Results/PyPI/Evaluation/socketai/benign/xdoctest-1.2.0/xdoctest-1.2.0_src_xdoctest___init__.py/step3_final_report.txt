  "purpose": "This code serves as the package initialization and documentation module for the xdoctest Python package, exposing APIs and version info.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal submodules and static documentation strings; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow from external sources or network activity.",
  "flows": "Static import statements and documentation; no dynamic data or external data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "Large static documentation strings, but these are typical for package docs; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package __init__.py with version info, imports, and documentation. No dynamic code, external input, or suspicious patterns are present. The documentation strings are static and serve informational purposes. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a typical Python package setup with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are consistent with this assessment.",
