  "purpose": "To perform a security assessment of the provided Python code, focusing on supply chain risks, malicious behavior, obfuscation, and vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`PyObjCTools.TestSupport`, `CoreLocation`), class and method definitions, the call to `assertCallableMetadataIsSane(CoreLocation)`",
  "sinks": "The call to `assertCallableMetadataIsSane` which verifies internal metadata; no external data or untrusted sources involved",
  "flows": "Import -> class definition -> test method -> call to `assertCallableMetadataIsSane(CoreLocation)`; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test that imports a testing framework and a system framework, then performs a simple metadata sanity check. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or manipulate data. The call to `assertCallableMetadataIsSane` is a standard validation function for internal framework consistency. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and the absence of external data or network activity indicate a benign and safe script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test verifying internal metadata of the CoreLocation framework. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or obfuscation present. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence level of 1. No adjustments are necessary.",
