  "purpose": "API signature validation for CoreLocation.CLGeocoder methods across OS versions, verifying method signatures and argument types.",
  "sources": "Method signatures and properties within the CoreLocation.CLGeocoder class, OS version checks.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data transmission.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only asserts method signatures and properties.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward API validation without suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying method signatures and OS version availability for CLGeocoder. It does not handle external input, perform network operations, or process untrusted data. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The purpose is purely to ensure API correctness. The scores assigned in the reports (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk ≈ 0.1) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. Given the lack of external data handling or security concerns, the risk score can be uniformly set to 0 for clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign API validation test suite with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores in the reports are appropriate; however, the risk score should be adjusted to 0 across all reports to reflect the non-threatening, purely validation purpose.",
