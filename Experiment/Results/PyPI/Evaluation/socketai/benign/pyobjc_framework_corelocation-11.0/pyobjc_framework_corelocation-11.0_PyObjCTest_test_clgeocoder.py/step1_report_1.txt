{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for the CoreLocation.CLGeocoder class, verifying method signatures and OS level requirements for a macOS/iOS environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only interacts with method signatures and annotations within the CoreLocation framework.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into security-sensitive functions or output channels; the code solely performs method signature assertions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present; the code is focused on method signature verification and does not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or malicious patterns are present. The code follows typical testing patterns for a framework.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests for the CLGeocoder class, checking method signatures and availability across different OS versions. It uses assertions to verify that specific methods accept block parameters of certain signatures, and checks result types. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no network or file operations. The code is straightforward, intended for compatibility testing, and does not include any malicious behavior or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for method signature validation within the CoreLocation framework. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks. The purpose is purely to verify API correctness across OS versions.",
