{
  "purpose": "This script is for setting up, configuring, and testing the PyObjC framework wrappers, including build, installation, and test commands.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PATH, CFLAGS), subprocess outputs (sw_vers, clang --version, xcrun), file reads (plist files, header files), and user inputs via command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess commands (executing system tools), file write operations (writing build info, modifying PKG-INFO), network-related module imports (though none explicitly shown here), and potentially modified sys.path for module imports.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and system commands into subprocess outputs; system commands influence file content and configuration; environment variables influence compilation flags; setup parameters influence build configuration and file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code involves system commands, file I/O, subprocess execution, and dynamic import, but these are typical for build scripts. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard build and setup script for a Python extension module, involving environment detection, file operations, subprocess calls, and dynamic configuration. It retrieves system and SDK info via system commands, manages sys.path and module loading for testing, and controls build parameters based on system environment. All operations are typical for build systems and do not exhibit malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate build and setup utility for the PyObjC project. It performs system checks, configures build parameters, and manages testing procedures without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
