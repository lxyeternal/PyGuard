  "purpose": "This script is a setup utility for building, testing, and installing the PyObjC framework wrappers, primarily for macOS.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (CFLAGS, PATH), system commands (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), file system (os.path, os.listdir), package metadata, and input arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess to invoke system commands; writes build info and project URLs into files; loads and reads plist files; manipulates sys.path; imports test modules dynamically; writes to files in build directories.",
  "flows": "System environment variables and system command outputs influence build flags and SDK detection; files are read to gather build info; subprocess output impacts SDK versioning; dynamic imports and test suite execution read code from multiple modules; write operations occur to configuration and info files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to invoke system commands like 'sw_vers', 'clang', 'xcrun' is standard for build scripts; no obfuscated or unusual language features; code constructs appear straightforward and typical for build tools.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup, build, test, and installation operations for a Python package. It interacts with system tools and environment variables to determine SDK versions and compiler configurations. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The subprocess calls are used for environment info and are typical for such scripts. The dynamic import of test modules and the modification of sys.path are common in test frameworks. The code's purpose aligns with package build automation without any malicious intent or behavior. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or destructive operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build and test utility for PyObjC, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs environment detection, build configuration, and testing routines typical for setup scripts. It does not contain malicious payloads or backdoors. The overall security risk is minimal.",
