  "purpose": "This script is a setup and build utility for the PyObjC framework, handling environment detection, system info retrieval, configuration, testing, and packaging.",
  "sources": "System commands (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), file reads (PKG-INFO, SDKSettings.plist), environment variables, dynamic module imports (test modules), sys.path modifications.",
  "sinks": "File writes (build info, PKG-INFO modifications), sys.path and sys.modules modifications, subprocess executions, environment variable reads.",
  "flows": "System commands provide environment info; environment variables influence build flags; dynamic imports load test modules; file operations record build info; sys.path modifications facilitate test execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; standard build/test procedures; no obfuscation or malicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical build, configuration, and testing tasks for a Python package, invoking system utilities for environment info, dynamically importing test modules, and modifying sys.path for test execution. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess calls are for environment detection, and dynamic imports are confined to test modules, which is standard practice. The code's structure and operations are consistent with legitimate build scripts. The low security risk stems from the use of subprocess and dynamic imports, which are common in such contexts but could be exploited if environment is compromised. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for standard package setup and testing.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard build and test utility for the PyObjC project, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concerns detected. The assigned scores (malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
