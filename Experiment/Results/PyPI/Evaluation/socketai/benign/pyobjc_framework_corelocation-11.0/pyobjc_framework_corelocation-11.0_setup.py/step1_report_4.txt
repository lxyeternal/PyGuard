{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up a Python package that provides wrappers for the macOS CoreLocation framework using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), os.listdir('Modules'), sys.path, __doc__",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code primarily performs package setup and configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only handles package setup, no data flow from source to sink involves untrusted data or system modification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious imports or code execution, standard setup script structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system and OS modules, modifies sys.path, and uses the pyobjc_setup module to define package setup parameters. It specifies framework dependencies and package details without executing external commands or handling untrusted input. The purpose is to prepare a Python extension module wrapping a macOS framework, which is typical and safe. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package that wraps the CoreLocation framework using PyObjC. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The package appears legitimate and intended for development purposes.",
