{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging and installing the pyobjc-framework-CoreLocation Python module, which provides wrappers for the CoreLocation framework on macOS.",
  "sources": "Reads from the filesystem to list modules in the 'Modules' directory, and uses standard Python modules 'os' and 'sys'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no untrusted data is written or executed.",
  "flows": "Uses filesystem data to generate dependencies for extension modules, which are then compiled as part of the package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard setup script with no unusual or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity or system modifications are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and modifies sys.path for local module resolution. It constructs a package setup configuration with a list of module dependencies dynamically generated by listing the 'Modules' directory, specifically targeting files starting with '_CoreLocation'. The setup parameters are typical for building Python C extensions with PyObjC. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network calls, or hidden backdoors. The purpose is straightforward package setup, with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a framework wrapper. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears legitimate and safe.",
