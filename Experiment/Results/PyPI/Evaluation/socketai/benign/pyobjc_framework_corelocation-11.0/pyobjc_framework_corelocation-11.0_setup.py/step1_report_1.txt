{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that provides wrappers for the macOS CoreLocation framework using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Reads from the filesystem (os.listdir), reads module files (_CoreLocation.m), and imports system modules (os, sys).",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the setup process writes files and installs dependencies, but no direct sinks for malicious data or actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Filesystem data (list of modules) is used to determine dependencies; setup parameters are constructed from static variables and filesystem info; no untrusted data flows into dangerous system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscated code detected. The script appears to be a standard package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules (os, sys), modifies sys.path, and defines package setup parameters. It dynamically lists files in the 'Modules' directory to set dependencies, which is typical for extension modules. The extra_link_args parameter links against the CoreLocation framework. No user input, network activity, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code's purpose aligns with installing a wrapper package. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script for macOS CoreLocation framework wrappers, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks.",
