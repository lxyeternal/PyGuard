{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for building and installing the 'pyobjc-framework-CoreLocation' package, which provides Python bindings for the macOS CoreLocation framework using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Filesystem directory 'Modules' where it lists files starting with '_CoreLocation' to determine dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script does not process user input, network data, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Filesystem listing of module files to dependency list; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a straightforward setup script with standard patterns and no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, modifies sys.path, dynamically lists module files for dependencies, and sets up extension modules linking against the CoreLocation framework. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, standard package setup script. No vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or obfuscation are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script for a Python extension module wrapping a macOS framework. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports and analyses are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is warranted.",
