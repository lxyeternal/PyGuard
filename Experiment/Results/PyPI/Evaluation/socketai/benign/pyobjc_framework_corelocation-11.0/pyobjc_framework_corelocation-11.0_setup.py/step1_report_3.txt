  "purpose": "Setup script for building and installing the pyobjc-framework-CoreLocation package, providing Python bindings for the macOS CoreLocation framework.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), os.listdir('Modules'), sys.path.insert, import statements, __doc__ string",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or data leaks; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations that suggest malicious activity",
  "flows": "None of the code appears to process untrusted input or data flows; primarily configuration and setup commands",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code structure is standard for a Python package setup script. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, modifies sys.path, defines package metadata, and configures extension modules with compilation dependencies. It references files in the 'Modules' directory and sets installation requirements. The code is straightforward, standard for a setup script, with no unusual code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script for a Python package wrapping a macOS framework. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is safe and typical for its purpose.",
