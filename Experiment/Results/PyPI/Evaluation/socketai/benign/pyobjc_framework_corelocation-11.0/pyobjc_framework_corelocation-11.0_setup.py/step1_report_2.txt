  "purpose": "Setup script for creating Python bindings for the macOS CoreLocation framework using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Reading the current file's directory to list module dependencies, importing system modules os and sys, reading from Modules directory.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; mainly involves static file operations and package setup.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily constructs package metadata and compilation instructions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated elements are present. The code performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for building a PyObjC wrapper. It modifies sys.path, imports setup utilities, defines package version, and configures build parameters. It dynamically lists files in the Modules directory for dependencies and specifies extra linker arguments for macOS frameworks. No external data input, user inputs, or network operations are present. No unusual code patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate package setup script for macOS PyObjC bindings. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
