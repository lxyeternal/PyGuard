  "purpose": "Unit test suite verifying constants, enum types, and method signatures of the CoreLocation framework for different OS versions.",
  "sources": "Constants, enum definitions, and method signatures within the CoreLocation module, especially in the context of OS version-specific features.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "The code performs static assertions on framework APIs; no data flow from sources to sinks occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and adheres to standard testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static test suite that verifies constants, enum types, and method signatures for the CoreLocation framework across different OS versions. It contains no untrusted data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The assertions are purely API validation, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. All signals indicate a benign, well-structured testing script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign API validation test suite with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, which are appropriate given the code's nature.",
