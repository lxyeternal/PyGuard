  "purpose": "The code loads and processes Markdown files containing JSON schema examples, then constructs Python classes from the schemas for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "importlib.resources for reading files, reading README.md and extracting code blocks, json.loads for parsing JSON schema data",
  "sinks": "json.loads potentially parsing untrusted data, constructing objects with unverified schema data",
  "flows": "Reading README.md via importlib.resources -> extracting code blocks -> parsing JSON -> building schema objects",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.resources to access package files is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns; no external network activity or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The script imports resources and processes them to build schema classes. It checks for 'as_file' attribute for compatibility, then reads 'README.md' file content. Extracted code blocks are parsed as JSON, and used to build schema classes via pjs.ObjectBuilder. The process appears to be standard schema processing, with no suspicious code, no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code. The use of json.loads on extracted code blocks assumes the data is JSON-formatted, but this is typical for schema processing and not inherently malicious. No credentials, secrets, or backdoors are present. Overall, the code is straightforward and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical schema processing setup for testing, with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It does not perform any network activity or contain obfuscated/malicious code. Risks are minimal, focused on potential JSON parsing errors which are not malicious.",
