{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load and process markdown examples containing JSON schemas from a package's README.md file and create schema classes for testing.",
  "sources": "importlib.resources for accessing package resources; reading the README.md file; json.loads for parsing JSON data from extracted code blocks.",
  "sinks": "json.loads applied to extracted code blocks; use of the schema data to build classes, but no direct data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "importlib.resources.read or path -> extract_code_blocks -> json.loads -> ObjectBuilder -> classes creation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of json.loads on data extracted from markdown code blocks could be risky if the source is untrusted, but in this context, it appears to process static package resources. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard resource management modules and a third-party JSON schema library. It conditionally handles resource access based on the availability of 'as_file' or 'path'. It extracts code blocks from a markdown file, parses them as JSON, and stores schemas for testing purposes. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No network, file modification, or command execution occurs. The logic is straightforward and intended for testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe, well-structured test setup that loads schemas from package resources for testing purposes. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
