  "purpose": "Load a README.md resource from the package, extract embedded JSON schema code blocks, parse them, and build schema classes for testing.",
  "sources": "importlib.resources to access README.md, markdown_support.extract_code_blocks to extract code blocks, json.loads to parse JSON schemas",
  "sinks": "json.loads on extracted code blocks, pjs.ObjectBuilder to create schema classes",
  "flows": "Reading resource -> extracting code blocks -> parsing JSON -> building schema classes",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward resource handling and JSON parsing",
  "analysis": "The code operates on static package resources, extracting JSON schemas from markdown documentation, parsing them with json.loads, and constructing classes with pjs.ObjectBuilder. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no external network activity or dynamic code execution. The process is typical for schema validation in testing environments. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of json.loads on trusted, static resources minimizes risk. The code is clear, well-structured, and does not perform any malicious actions or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from parsing JSON from static documentation files, which is standard and low-risk in this context. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
