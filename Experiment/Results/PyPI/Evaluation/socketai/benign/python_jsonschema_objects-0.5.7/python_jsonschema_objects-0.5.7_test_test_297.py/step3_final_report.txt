  "purpose": "Load a JSON schema from a local resource file and test schema validation behavior using python_jsonschema_objects.",
  "sources": "Reading 'adaptive-card.json' from resources directory; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processed; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Schema file read -> schema loaded -> class built -> tests executed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs local file reading of a JSON schema and uses a third-party library to build classes for validation. Tests verify schema behavior with specific flags. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted user input is present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The resource file is used solely for testing purposes, and the operations are standard for schema validation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or very low) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for JSON schema validation with no malicious or security risks. The high risk scores in some reports are overestimations; overall, the code poses no threat. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the security risk at 0.",
