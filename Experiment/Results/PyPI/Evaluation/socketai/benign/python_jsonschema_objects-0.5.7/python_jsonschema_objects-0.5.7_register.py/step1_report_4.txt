  "purpose": "Convert Markdown content from a file to reStructuredText format using Pandoc.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Potential exposure if the 'README.md' file contains untrusted or malicious content, which could lead to code injection or processing issues within the Pandoc library.",
  "flows": "Source: open('README.md').read() -> Pandoc processing via pandoc.Document() and setting 'doc.markdown' -> Conversion to rst with 'doc.rst'.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Pandoc path; reading a fixed file 'README.md' without validation; no user input handling or sanitization. No other suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a fixed path for Pandoc and verifies its existence. It reads from a static file 'README.md' without validation or sanitization. Uses the pandoc library to convert Markdown to reStructuredText. No external inputs, network connections, or obfuscated code detected. The use of a fixed file and path appears standard for local conversions, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward file conversion using Pandoc with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It reads a static file and processes it securely within expected parameters.",
