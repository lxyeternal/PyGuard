{
  "purpose": "Convert a Markdown file ('README.md') to reStructuredText (RST) format using Pandoc.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is written to external systems or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input from the 'README.md' file is loaded into the Pandoc Document object; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded path to Pandoc executable; no dynamic execution or obfuscated code. The code reads a local file without validation, but this is typical for static documentation conversion.",
  "analysis": "The script sets the Pandoc path explicitly and checks for its existence, which is standard. It reads a fixed file ('README.md') and converts it to RST format. There are no indications of malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No untrusted input handling or external command execution beyond the static Pandoc call. The code appears to perform a straightforward document format conversion without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple static conversion utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads a local Markdown file and converts it using Pandoc, which is a standard practice. No malware or malicious patterns detected.",
