  "purpose": "Convert Markdown to reStructuredText using the pandoc library",
  "sources": "Reading the file 'README.md' from disk",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or network operations",
  "flows": "File read from 'README.md' to the pandoc Document object for conversion",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; the only path setting is static and relates to a local binary",
  "analysis": "The code sets the path for the pandoc executable and verifies its existence. It then reads a local Markdown file ('README.md') and converts it to reStructuredText using the pandoc library. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no network communication, and no suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The use of 'pandoc' appears standard for document conversion purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward document conversion without any malicious intent or suspicious activity. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
