  "purpose": "Convert Markdown to reStructuredText using Pandoc.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file directly, checks for Pandoc executable at a fixed path.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs; static file reading and path check only.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' from disk; no external data or network flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "Ignores the 'src' parameter; uses hardcoded Pandoc path; reads static file without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a fixed path for Pandoc and verifies its existence. It ignores the 'src' parameter, which may be a bug but not malicious. It reads 'README.md' directly without validation, which is typical for static conversion scripts. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or untrusted input processing is present. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are detected. The static file reading and hardcoded path are minor design issues but do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static document converter with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The main issues are functional (ignoring 'src') and configuration-related (hardcoded path), not security vulnerabilities.",
