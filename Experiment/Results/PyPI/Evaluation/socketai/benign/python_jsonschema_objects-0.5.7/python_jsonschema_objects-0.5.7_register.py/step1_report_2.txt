  "purpose": "Convert Markdown files to reStructuredText format using the pandoc library.",
  "sources": "Reading the file 'README.md' from disk.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; no data leakage or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Source: Reading 'README.md' -> Processing with pandoc to generate rst output.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded path to pandoc executable; no dynamic input handling or user input processing; no suspicious code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a fixed path for pandoc, checks for its existence, and reads 'README.md' to convert markdown to rst. The use of a fixed path and reading a static file are typical and not inherently malicious. No external network activity, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated elements are present. The code appears to serve a straightforward conversion purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple script for converting markdown to rst with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The fixed path and static file reading do not introduce security risks or malicious intent.",
