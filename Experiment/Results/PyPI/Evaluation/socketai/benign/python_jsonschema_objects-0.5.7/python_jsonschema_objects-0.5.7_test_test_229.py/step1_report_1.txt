  "purpose": "Unit testing for jsonschema object validation behavior, specifically handling of 'const' properties.",
  "sources": "Code reads the schema definitions and creates schema-based objects; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; validation errors are raised within the code itself, not external systems.",
  "flows": "Schema definitions are used to instantiate objects and validate property values; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. Uses standard pytest testing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines unit tests for schema validation using the 'python_jsonschema_objects' library. It tests handling of 'const' properties by creating schemas with fixed values and ensuring validation enforces these constraints. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data leakage. The library used is an open-source JSON schema validation tool. No external input handling or network communication occurs within this code. The code appears solely to validate schema behavior in a controlled environment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of unit tests for schema validation. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It is safe and intended for verifying validation logic.",
