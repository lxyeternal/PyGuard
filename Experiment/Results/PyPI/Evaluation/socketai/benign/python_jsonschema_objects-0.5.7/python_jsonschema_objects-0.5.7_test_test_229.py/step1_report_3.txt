  "purpose": "Unit tests for the python_jsonschema_objects library, specifically testing 'const' property validation.",
  "sources": "Input data for schema validation (schema definitions, object instantiations, property assignments).",
  "sinks": "Assertion statements, exception handling for validation errors.",
  "flows": "Schema definitions -> Object creation -> Property assignment -> Validation checks and exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or malicious constructs detected. No dynamic code execution or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard schema validation tests using the pjo library. It defines schemas with 'const' constraints, creates objects, assigns values, and expects validation errors when constraints are violated. All operations are typical of test code for validation logic. No suspicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or malicious activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward unit testing code for schema validation. It contains no malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is normal test code verifying library functionality.",
