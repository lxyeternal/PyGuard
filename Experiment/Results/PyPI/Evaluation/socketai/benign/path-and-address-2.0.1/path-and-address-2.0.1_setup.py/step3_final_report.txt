  "purpose": "Standard package setup script for 'path-and-address' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No dynamic sources; static metadata, __doc__ reference.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __doc__ without a module docstring; minor runtime warning potential.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static package metadata. It imports setup functions, defines package info, and calls setup(). The only dynamic element is __doc__, which is undefined here, possibly causing a warning but not a security issue. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure code patterns are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature and minor __doc__ concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor issue is the use of __doc__ without a module docstring, which does not impact security. All reports are consistent and accurate.",
