{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'path-and-address'. It specifies package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'setuptools' module import, and the setup() function parameters including package metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function writes configuration data to package installation files; no direct data leaks or untrusted input handling occurs.",
  "flows": "The script imports data from 'setuptools' and passes static metadata into setup(), with no dynamic or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code is standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with static, well-defined parameters. No external inputs are processed or injected, and no suspicious code actions are evident. The package metadata appears normal and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks detected.",
