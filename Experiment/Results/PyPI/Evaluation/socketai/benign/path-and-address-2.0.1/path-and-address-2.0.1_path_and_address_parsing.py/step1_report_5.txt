{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to resolve and split network addresses into hostname and port components.",
  "sources": "The functions read input data from function parameters: 'path_or_address' and 'address'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points are the use of unvalidated input in 'split_address', especially when converting port to integer and validating hostname and port.",
  "flows": "Input 'path_or_address' or 'address' flows into 'split_address' where it is split and validated; the result is used in 'resolve' to determine output tuple.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies on external 'valid_hostname' and 'valid_port' functions, which are not provided. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform address parsing and validation with external validators. 'split_address' converts string input into hostname and port, validating each component. 'resolve' determines the appropriate output based on parameters. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic is present. The code's only concern may relate to trusting the external 'valid_hostname' and 'valid_port' functions, but within this context, there are no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward address parsing utilities with no malicious behavior or security risks evident from this fragment. It mainly validates and splits address strings for use elsewhere.",
