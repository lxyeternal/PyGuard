{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to resolve and split network addresses and paths, validating hostnames and ports.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'path_or_address', 'address', and external functions 'valid_hostname' and 'valid_port'.",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting 'path' and 'address'; no data writes or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into 'split_address' which validates and parses them, then results are returned by 'resolve'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs address parsing and validation, relying on external validation functions. The logic is straightforward, checking address formats, splitting components, and validating hostname and port. No malicious data handling, network activity, or hidden behaviors are present. Functions are primarily for address validation with no security or malware risks observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for address validation and parsing, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external validation functions, which should be reviewed separately for security.",
