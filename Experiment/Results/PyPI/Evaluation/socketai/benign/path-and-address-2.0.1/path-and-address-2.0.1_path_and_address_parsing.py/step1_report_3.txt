{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for resolving and splitting network addresses into host and port components.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'path_or_address', 'address', and string conversions within 'split_address'.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions perform actions that send data externally or handle untrusted data in a way that could cause leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into 'resolve' and 'split_address', which validate and parse address strings, but do not transmit or store data externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of validation functions is standard; no obfuscated or malicious patterns found.",
  "analysis": "The code validates and parses addresses, checking hostname and port validity via external functions. It does not include network operations, external calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The logic is straightforward, focusing on input validation and string parsing. No suspicious control flow or obfuscated code observed. The functions depend on external validation functions 'valid_hostname' and 'valid_port', which are assumed to be secure. Overall, the code appears to serve its purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs address parsing and validation with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It appears safe and standard for address handling routines.",
