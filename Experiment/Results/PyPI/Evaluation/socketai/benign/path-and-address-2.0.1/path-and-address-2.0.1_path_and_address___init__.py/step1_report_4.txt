{
  "purpose": "Defines and exports utility functions for command-line server tools related to path and address validation and resolution.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .parsing (resolve, split_address), .validation (valid_address, valid_hostname, valid_port). No external input handling is directly visible.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code only imports functions and defines an __all__ list, with no data processing or untrusted data handling evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is solely about module organization and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets detected. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from internal modules and sets an export list for public API. There is no data processing, no input handling, and no dynamic code execution. It serves as a module interface definition with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module interface with no malicious intent or security risks. It only exports functions related to address resolution and validation, with no signs of malware or security issues.",
