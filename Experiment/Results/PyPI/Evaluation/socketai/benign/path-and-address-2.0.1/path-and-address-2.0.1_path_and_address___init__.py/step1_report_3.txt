{
  "purpose": "Provide command-line server tools for resolving addresses, splitting addresses, and validating addresses, hostnames, and ports.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions from internal modules (.parsing and .validation). No external data input or untrusted sources are explicitly read in this fragment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code fragment; it does not process or execute untrusted data or perform actions that could leak data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as there are no data inputs or processing beyond module imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward module setup with versioning and public API definitions. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs are present. No obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code defines metadata and imports specific functions from internal modules (.parsing and .validation). It exports these functions as part of the module's public API. The code is clean, minimal, and adheres to standard module setup patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or supply chain sabotage. The actual security-related logic would reside in the imported modules, but based solely on this fragment, there is no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for address and hostname validation tools with no signs of malware or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, non-malicious, and safe for use.",
