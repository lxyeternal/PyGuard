{
  "purpose": "Provides command-line server tools for address parsing and validation.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from internal modules (.parsing and .validation).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; functions are imported and re-exported without processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that imports functions for address resolution and validation, then exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic behavior, input handling, network activity, or data processing. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns suggest it is benign. The security implications depend on the imported modules, but within this snippet, no malicious or risky behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static interface module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high confidence scores and zero malware/security risk scores are justified based on this analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
