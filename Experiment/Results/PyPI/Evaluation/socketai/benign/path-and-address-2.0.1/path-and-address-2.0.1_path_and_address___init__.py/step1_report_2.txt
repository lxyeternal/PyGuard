{
  "purpose": "Provides command-line server tools related to path and address resolution, validation, and parsing.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from local modules .parsing and .validation.",
  "targets": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sinks; the code only exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports and exports utility functions for address resolution and validation. It does not process input data directly nor execute dynamic code. The module appears to be part of a larger package and only manages interface exposure. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a benign module that provides utility function exports without performing any input processing or system modifications. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
