{
  "purpose": "Defines and exports functions related to command-line server tools for handling paths and addresses.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from local modules '.parsing' and '.validation'. No external or untrusted input reading is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or cause side effects. No direct data handling or output code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks. The code only imports and re-exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and documentation-oriented.",
  "analysis": "This code module mainly declares its purpose, version, and re-exports functions from other modules. There are no data inputs, no processing, no network connections, or potentially malicious behavior. The import statements suggest dependencies on other modules, but these are standard and not inherently malicious. The code appears to be part of a larger library for server address validation and parsing, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focused on organizing and exporting functions for address parsing and validation. No malicious intent or security threats are evident. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or sensitive operations.",
