{
  "purpose": "The code provides command-line server tools for resolving addresses, splitting addresses, and validating address components.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from local modules: .parsing (resolve, split_address) and .validation (valid_address, valid_hostname, valid_port).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exposes functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. The module appears to be a straightforward library wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports functions from internal modules and sets the __all__ list for public API exposure. There are no dynamic code executions, user input handling, network operations, or other risky behaviors. The license and version information are standard. Without additional context or implementation details of imported functions, there are no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This module serves as a simple interface for address resolution and validation functions. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this snippet.",
