{
  "purpose": "The code provides validation functions for addresses, hostnames, and ports, ensuring input correctness without performing any malicious actions.",
  "sources": "The address string input in valid_address; hostname string in valid_hostname; port string in valid_port.",
  "sinks": "The functions do not include external data sinks or untrusted data effects; validation results are returned locally.",
  "flows": "Input address flows through splitting into hostname and port, then validation functions are called, with no external or side-effect actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; regex for hostname validation is standard; no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward hostname and port validation using regex and range checks. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The regex and logic are standard and correctly implemented. No external network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are involved. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Minor variations in risk scores (0.1-0.2) are acceptable but could be uniformly set to 0 for maximum accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard validation utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary; the code poses minimal security risk and is safe for use.",
