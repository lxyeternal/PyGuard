{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to validate addresses, specifically checking the hostname and optional port for correctness.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'address' parameter passed to valid_address, and the hostname and port strings derived from splitting the address.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that lead to data leaks or security impacts; it only performs validation.",
  "flows": "Input address is split into hostname and port components; these are validated separately through internal functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The regex appears standard for hostname validation. No malicious intent is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides hostname and port validation functions without any external or network activity. It uses regex matching to validate hostnames, ensuring they conform to hostname rules. The port validation safely converts string to integer and checks range. No data leaks, malicious code, or harmful behavior detected. The overall logic is straightforward and typical for address validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard address validation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured and does not contain malicious payloads or backdoors.",
