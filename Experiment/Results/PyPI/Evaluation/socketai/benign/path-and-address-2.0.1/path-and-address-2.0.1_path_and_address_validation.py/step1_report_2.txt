{
  "purpose": "Validate whether a given address string is a valid hostname and port combination.",
  "sources": "Input address string in valid_address function; hostname string in valid_hostname function; port string in valid_port function.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code performs validation but does not interact with external systems or handle untrusted data beyond validation.",
  "flows": "Input address -> split into components -> validate hostname and port -> return boolean result.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external communication.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward validation utility for hostnames and ports. It uses regex to validate hostnames against common rules, checks port ranges, and handles address splitting. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The functions are purely for input validation with no side effects or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign hostname and port validation utility with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard validation routines without external dependencies or risky operations.",
