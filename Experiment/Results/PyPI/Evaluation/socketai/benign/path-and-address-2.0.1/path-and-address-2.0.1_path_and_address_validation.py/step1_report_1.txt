  "purpose": "Validate network address strings, including hostname and port components.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'address' in valid_address, 'host' in valid_hostname, and 'port' in valid_port.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data outputs; validation functions only process input data internally.",
  "flows": "Input address -> split into hostname and port -> validate hostname and port individually.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Uses regex for hostname validation, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, focusing on validating hostname and port formats. It splits addresses, checks length and format of hostname, and verifies port number ranges. No obfuscated code, no suspicious data handling, and no external network activity. The regex for hostname validation follows standard naming rules. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The functions are simple and serve the purpose of validation without any side effects or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard address validation utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or data leaks. No suspicious behavior or malware detected.",
