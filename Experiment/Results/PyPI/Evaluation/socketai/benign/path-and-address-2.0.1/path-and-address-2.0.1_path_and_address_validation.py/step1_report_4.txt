  "purpose": "Validate whether a given address string is a valid hostname and optional port.",
  "sources": "The address string input provided to valid_address function.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data usage observed; functions return boolean values based on input validation.",
  "flows": "Input address is split into hostname and port, validated separately through regex and integer checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Regex appears standard for hostname validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation of hostnames and ports. Uses regex for hostname syntax, splits input address, and checks port ranges. No dynamic code execution, no data leaks, or suspicious behavior observed. The regex for hostname validation is typical and not obfuscated. The functions are straightforward and serve a common purpose of input validation. No indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior in logic or implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard hostname and port validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and correctly implemented for its intended purpose.",
