{
  "purpose": "Validate whether a given address string is a valid hostname and optional port",
  "sources": "Address string input to valid_address(), hostname string input to valid_hostname(), port string input to valid_port()",
  "sinks": "Return values of validation functions, no external data sinks or outputs are evident",
  "flows": "Input address -> parsed into components -> validated for hostname and port -> return boolean result",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward validation functions for addresses, hostnames, and ports. It uses regex matching for hostname validation, which appears standard. The port validation safely converts strings to integers and checks port ranges. No external data sources, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present. The code does not contain malicious backdoors, data leaks, or malicious logic. It solely performs input validation, with no indication of malicious intent or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected input validation for hostnames and ports with no suspicious activity.",
