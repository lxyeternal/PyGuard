  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n- It reads `sys.argv` to check for `--version`.\n- It writes output to `sys.stdout`.\n- There are no external data fetches, no dynamic code execution, no secrets, no obfuscation, and no network activity.\n- The code is straightforward and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. They correctly identify that the code is straightforward and static.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly conclude that the script is benign, with no security risks or malware.\n\n- **Scores given to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0 or very close to 0\n  - `confidence`: 1.0 (full confidence)\n\n  These scores seem appropriate given the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Since there's no malicious behavior, the malware score should be 0. All reports agree on this.\n\n- **Obfuscated code:**  \n  The code is clear, no obfuscation present, so 0 is correct.\n\n- **Security risk:**  \n  The code performs only static output based on command-line args, with no external data, secrets, or dynamic behavior. A score of 0 or very close to it is justified.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:**  \n  No assumptions are made beyond what the code shows. The logic is sound, and no vulnerabilities are introduced.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a benign CLI utility.\n- The malware score should be **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n- The risk score should be **0** (or very close to it).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Metric             | Suggested Score | Justification                                               |\n|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0                 | No malicious behavior, no external code or network activity |\n| Obfuscated         | 0                 | Clear, straightforward code without obfuscation             |\n| Security Risk      | 0                 | Static info display, no secrets, no dynamic behavior       |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and poses no security risk.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence from the code and reports.",
