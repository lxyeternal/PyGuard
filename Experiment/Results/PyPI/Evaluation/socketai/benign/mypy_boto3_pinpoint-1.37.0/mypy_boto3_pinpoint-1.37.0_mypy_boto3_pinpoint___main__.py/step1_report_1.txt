  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a Python package, providing version and package information.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output, potentially exposing internal info if misused.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) triggers info display functions, which output static package info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed. The code simply prints static info.",
  "analysis": "The code reads command-line arguments to determine whether to display version information or package info. The output is static text containing package details, with no external data fetching, no user input beyond command-line args, and no data leaks or network activity. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present. The structure is straightforward and does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign CLI utility that provides package information. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
