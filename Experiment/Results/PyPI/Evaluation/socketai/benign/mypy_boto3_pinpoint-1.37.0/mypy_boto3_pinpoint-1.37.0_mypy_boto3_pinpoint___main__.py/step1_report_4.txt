  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a Python package providing information about the package and its dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and outputs information to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument; if present, calls print_version() which outputs version info, else calls print_info() to output package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No external data sources, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and clean.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI interface that outputs package info or version details. It reads the command-line argument '--version' to decide what to display. There are no input/output flows involving untrusted data beyond command-line args, which are benign here. No external network access, no file operations, no suspicious behaviors, or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility for informational purposes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
