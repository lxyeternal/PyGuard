  "purpose": "A simple CLI script that outputs package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line argument parsing",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for outputting static package info or version",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv to conditional logic, leading to static output via sys.stdout.write",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no dynamic code execution, secrets, or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI utility that checks for '--version' argument and outputs static information accordingly. It uses standard Python functions with no external dependencies, dynamic code, or network activity. The code is clear, well-structured, and performs only static output. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign and static nature of the code. Given the simplicity, the risk is minimal, and the code does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs static output based on command-line arguments, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
