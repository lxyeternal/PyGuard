  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version.\n- It checks for a `--version` argument; if present, it prints the version, else prints package info.\n- Uses `sys.stdout.write` for output.\n- No external data fetching, no dynamic code execution, no secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- Overall, very straightforward and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues detected. The code matches the description and performs only static output.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities present; no user input processing beyond a simple argument check, and no external data or secrets involved.\n- **Security risks:** Very low, primarily just informational.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All describe the script as a benign CLI utility that outputs static package info or version.\n- No anomalies, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, no external data or network activity.\n- All assign malware score = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 or 0.1 (some mention a small, negligible risk, but it's justified given the simplicity).\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- Security risk: mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1. Given the code's simplicity, 0 is more accurate.\n- Confidence: 1.0, justified by the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n  The obfuscated score of 0 is correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n  The security risk score of 0 (or very close to it) is justified, as there's no evident security concern.\n\n- **Any claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  No. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious intent or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — minimal security risk, just informational output.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is a benign CLI utility with no security concerns.",
