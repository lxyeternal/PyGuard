  "purpose": "CLI entrypoint script for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, writes output to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout, no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers call to print_version(), which outputs version info; otherwise, calls print_info() to output package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The code is straightforward and standard for CLI scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to display package information and version. It checks for '--version' argument to decide which info to print. Uses sys.stdout.write for output, which is standard. No external data sources, network activity, or untrusted data processing. The code does not include any dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or sensitive data handling. Overall, the code performs a simple, benign CLI function without suspicious or malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility for displaying package info and version. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and performs straightforward output functions. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
