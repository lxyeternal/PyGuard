  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a simple CLI script that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n- It uses standard Python functions (`sys.argv`, `sys.stdout.write`) with no external data fetching, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The code is straightforward, well-structured, and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly implements the described functionality. All reports agree on its benign nature.\n- **Presence of malicious behavior:** None of the reports identify any malicious actions or suspicious code.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **External dependencies or network activity:** None present.\n- **Secrets or credentials:** Not present.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws are evident. The code performs as intended, with clear control flow and output.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with code clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign very low (0 or 0.1). Given the benign nature, 0 is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code only outputs static info and does not perform any network, file, or dynamic operations, the risk is minimal.\n- The slight non-zero score (0.1) in some reports likely reflects a conservative approach, but given the evidence, 0 is more accurate.\n\n### Potential issues with the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all assessments are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The code's simplicity and static nature make it inherently safe.\n- No need for score adjustments.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\nThis is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
