  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports agree that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`, with no input handling, external calls, or dynamic behavior. The code is benign, serving solely as a metadata declaration. No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the actual code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The only notable anomaly is the future copyright year \"2025\" in some reports, which is likely a typo or oversight, but not malicious.  \n- No report mentions any obfuscation or malicious intent beyond the benign code.  \n- All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward and non-malicious.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- The obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.  \n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n- No report assigns a risk score higher than 0.5, which is appropriate. The code is purely a version declaration with no security implications.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n- All reports assign malware = 0, which aligns with the code content.  \n- No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)  \n\nThe only minor point is the future copyright year \"2025,\" which is likely a typo but not a security concern.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a straightforward, benign version declaration with no malicious or security-related issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThese match the current report assessments.",
