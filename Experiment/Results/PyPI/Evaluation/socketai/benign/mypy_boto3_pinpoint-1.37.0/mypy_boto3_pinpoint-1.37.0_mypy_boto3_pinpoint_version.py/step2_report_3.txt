  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Logic Confirmation:**\n   - All reports describe a simple assignment: `__version__ = \"1.37.0\"` with a comment.\n   - There are no input sources, data flows, external calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is static, straightforward, and serves as a version identifier.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - No factual errors or logical flaws are evident in any report.\n   - All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n   - The only minor note is the future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious or suspicious.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence scores are high (1 or 0.9), reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed; scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - The code is purely a static version declaration, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - No malicious activity is present; the code is just metadata.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports reasonably avoid assumptions; they note the future year as possibly inconsistent but not malicious.\n   - No unwarranted security concerns are inferred.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign description.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a straightforward, static version assignment with a comment. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or oversight, not a security concern. The code poses no threat, no malware, and no obfuscation.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with all reports and the code's actual content.",
