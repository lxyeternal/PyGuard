  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - The code contains only a docstring and a straightforward assignment, with no input handling, external calls, or dynamic behavior.\n   - The presence of a copyright comment with a future year (2025) is noted but deemed not suspicious or malicious.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No reports identify any malicious code, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or external data flows are present.\n   - The code is standard for defining package version metadata.\n\n3. **Anomalies and Potential Issues:**\n   - Some reports mention the future copyright year (2025) as an anomaly, but this is not inherently malicious.\n   - No report indicates any obfuscation or malware indicators.\n\n4. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - Confidence scores are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty about benignity.\n   - The only minor point is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a benign, standard version declaration.\n   - No evidence suggests malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign intent.\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the reports and scores accurately reflect the code's security posture.",
