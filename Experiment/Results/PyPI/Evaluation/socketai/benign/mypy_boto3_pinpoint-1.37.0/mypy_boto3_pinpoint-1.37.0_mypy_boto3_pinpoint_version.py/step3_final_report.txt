{
  "purpose": "Define the package version as a static string for version control.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data or external calls present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment without dynamic or external data.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year '2025' noted, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment and a single assignment of a version string. No input, external calls, or dynamic behavior are present. All reports agree on its benign nature. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or placeholder. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are detected. The malware score is correctly 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. The risk score should be minimal, reflecting the benign and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. The scores should be: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1 to account for the anomaly, but overall security risk is negligible.",
