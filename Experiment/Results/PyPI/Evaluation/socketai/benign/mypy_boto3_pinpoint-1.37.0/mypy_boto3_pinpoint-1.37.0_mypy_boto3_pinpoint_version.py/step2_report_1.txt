  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code only assigns a static string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no input sources, data flows, external calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is purely declarative, serving as a version identifier.\n\n2. **Potential Anomalies & Comments**:\n   - Several reports note the copyright year as 2025, which is in the future relative to the data cutoff (October 2023). This is unusual but not malicious—likely a typo or placeholder.\n   - No report indicates any obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code patterns.\n\n3. **Malware & Security Risks**:\n   - All reports assign a benign, static version string.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious intent.\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n4. **Score Justification & Adjustments**:\n   - The risk scores are all 0 or 0.9, with the highest at 0.9 for report 3 due to the copyright year anomaly.\n   - Given the benign nature, even the 0.9 score seems high; it should be lowered to reflect the actual minimal risk.\n   - The malware score remains 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is standard, minimal, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n   - The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not constitute a security risk.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The current scores are reasonable, but the highest risk score (0.9) for report 3 overstates the risk. It should be adjusted down to 0 or 0.1 to reflect the negligible security concern.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is correct.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the code.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (a very minor concern due to the future copyright year, but not a security issue)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious elements. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The scores should be:\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.1\n\nThis accurately reflects the negligible risk and confirms the benign nature of the code.",
