  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. The scores should be: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1 to account for the anomaly, but overall security risk is negligible."
