  "purpose": "Define the version string for the package or module.",
  "sources": "The version string is hardcoded in the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the version string is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets beyond the version, or unusual constructs. The comment indicates a copyright year in the future (2025), but that is not suspicious itself.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a version string to __version__ and includes a comment. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no untrusted data handling. The presence of a future copyright year is unusual but not malicious. The code appears to serve as a metadata declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no suspicious behaviors or malware indicators.",
