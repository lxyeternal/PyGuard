  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The script is a standard `setup.py` for packaging a Python library.\n- It reads a local README.md for the long description.\n- It calls `setuptools.setup()` with static metadata, dependencies, and URLs.\n- No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Packaging script.\n- Sources: Reads README.md, no other data.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static data, no untrusted input.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Accurate, straightforward, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate setup script.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Package configuration.\n- Sources: Reads README.md, static metadata.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static data only.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Correct, standard setup script.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1.0.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate, no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Package setup.\n- Sources: README.md, static strings.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Correct, typical setup script.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Package configuration.\n- Sources: README.md, static data.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Accurate.\n- Conclusion: Benign.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Setup for distribution.\n- Sources: README.md, static strings.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Correct.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected. All reports agree.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is a standard setup script with no external data processing, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns, a risk score of **0** is justified.\n\n### Final justification:\n\nThe code is a straightforward, static `setup.py` script for packaging a Python library. It reads a local README file and calls `setuptools.setup()` with hardcoded metadata, dependencies, and URLs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThis aligns with all reports and the actual code content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, standard, and poses no security risk. The scores should reflect this, with all being zero.",
