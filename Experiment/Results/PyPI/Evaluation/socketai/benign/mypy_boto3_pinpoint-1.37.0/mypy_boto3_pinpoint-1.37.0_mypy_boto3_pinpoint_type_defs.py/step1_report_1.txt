{
  "purpose": "Define detailed type annotations and data structures for the Amazon Pinpoint service SDK in Python, facilitating static type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "All type definitions are primarily based on the imported types and the structure of TypedDicts; no direct data input sources or untrusted data streams are explicitly read within this code. The source is primarily the code's own static definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in this code that handle untrusted data or perform output operations. It is purely type declaration code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this code solely declares data structures and type annotations, with no runtime logic, input/output handling, or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is composed of static type definitions, which are standard and safe. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of Python TypedDict class declarations, unions, and conditional imports for type compatibility across Python versions. It is a comprehensive set of type annotations for the AWS Pinpoint SDK. The structure is consistent with standard type declaration practices, with no dynamic code, network activity, or input/output logic. The code aims to enhance type safety and documentation clarity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks in this static, declarative structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of type annotations for the AWS Pinpoint SDK, entirely static and solely for type checking purposes. It contains no executable or input/output code, no hardcoded secrets, no network operations, and no obfuscated or malicious patterns. Therefore, it poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
