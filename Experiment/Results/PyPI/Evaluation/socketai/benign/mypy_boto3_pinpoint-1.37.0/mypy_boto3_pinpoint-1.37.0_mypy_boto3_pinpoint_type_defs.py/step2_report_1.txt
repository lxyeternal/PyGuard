  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the static nature of the code, the absence of runtime logic, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for AWS Pinpoint SDK.  \n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code consists solely of static type definitions, primarily TypedDicts, Unions, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. No runtime logic, input/output handling, or dynamic code execution exists.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** The report assigns a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which is accurate.  \n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, purely declarative, with no malicious behavior.  \n**Verdict:** Fully consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose:** \"Empty response\" with no further details.  \n- **Analysis:** No information provided.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Cannot assess based on empty data.  \n**Verdict:** No evidence of malicious intent. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for AWS Pinpoint SDK.  \n- **Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly notes that the code is static, with no dynamic or executable parts. The code is a comprehensive set of data schemas, with no runtime logic or external data handling.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** No signs of malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and data structures for AWS Pinpoint SDK.  \n- **Analysis:** The report emphasizes the static, declarative nature of the code, with no runtime logic or external data processing. It highlights the standard practices of conditional imports and extensive type annotations.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** No malicious patterns, no external communication, no obfuscated code.  \n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for AWS Pinpoint SDK, facilitating type safety.  \n- **Analysis:** The report correctly notes that the code is purely declarative, with no executable logic, no data flow from untrusted sources, and no signs of malicious behavior. The extensive use of TypedDicts and Union types is standard for type hinting modules.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Zero malware risk, no suspicious patterns.  \n**Verdict:** Well-founded and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**  \nAll reports consistently identify that this code is a static, purely declarative set of type annotations and data structure definitions for the AWS Pinpoint SDK in Python. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, backdoors, or runtime behavior that could pose security threats.\n\n**Final Assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard type definitions)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured static type declaration module intended for static type checking and documentation. It poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
