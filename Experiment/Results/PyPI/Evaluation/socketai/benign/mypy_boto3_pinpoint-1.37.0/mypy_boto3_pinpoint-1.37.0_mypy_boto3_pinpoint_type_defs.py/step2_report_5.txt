  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Static type annotations for AWS Pinpoint SDK.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No runtime data, only static declarations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Entirely static, standard TypedDict and Union definitions, conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no external communication, purely type declarations.\n- **Confidence:** 1, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that this is purely static type declaration code with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Empty response.\n- **Note:** No further details, likely an incomplete or placeholder report.\n\n**Assessment:** No information provided; cannot evaluate security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for the SDK.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No dynamic code, no data processing, only static data schemas.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Well-structured, standard type hints, no runtime logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign static type definitions.\n- **Confidence:** 1, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly identifies the static, safe nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and data structures for AWS SDK.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No runtime logic, only data schemas.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Analysis:** Static, well-structured, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Entirely safe, no security risks.\n- **Confidence:** 1, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurately describes the code as purely declarative and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for the SDK.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Static data schemas, no runtime logic.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Analysis:** Well-structured, standard type hints, no external or dangerous operations.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks or malware.\n- **Confidence:** 1, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly confirms the benign, static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that this is a comprehensive set of static type annotations using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for Python compatibility.\n- **Security Implications:** No evidence of dynamic code, network activity, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Malware / Obfuscation:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Confidence Level:** Very high (all reports with confidence 1).\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nGiven the static, declarative nature of this code, its purpose as type annotations for a SDK, and the absence of any runtime or external interactions, **the malware score should be 0**. The obfuscated score remains 0 as there's no obfuscation or hidden code. The overall risk score is also 0, as it poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**My estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed assessments from all reports.",
