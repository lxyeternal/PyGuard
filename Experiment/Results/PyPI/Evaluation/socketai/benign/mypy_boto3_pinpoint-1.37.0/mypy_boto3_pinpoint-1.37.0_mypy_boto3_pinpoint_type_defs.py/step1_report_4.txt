  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Pinpoint service SDK, facilitating type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Type declarations, imports, and constant definitions for various API request/response structures.",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data sinks; the code only defines data types and constants used for API interactions.",
  "flows": "No executable logic; the code strictly consists of type annotations and data structure definitions, with no data flow or runtime behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. No suspicious imports or operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of Python type hints and TypedDict definitions for AWS Pinpoint API data structures. It includes conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions, extensive type annotations, and no dynamic execution or runtime logic. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms. The code serves solely as a type-safe interface layer for API interactions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, focusing on type safety and API schema definitions for AWS Pinpoint. It contains no malicious behavior, sabotage, or security threats. The absence of executable logic, suspicious imports, or hidden code indicates a benign supply chain dependency setup with no security concerns.",
