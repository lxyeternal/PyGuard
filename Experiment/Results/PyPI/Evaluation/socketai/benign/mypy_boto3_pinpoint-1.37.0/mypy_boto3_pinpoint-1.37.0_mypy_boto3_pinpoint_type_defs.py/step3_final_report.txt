  "purpose": "Static type annotations for AWS Pinpoint SDK in Python, defining data schemas with TypedDicts and Union types.",
  "sources": "Purely static data structure definitions, no runtime logic, input/output handling, or external data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data flow, no untrusted input handling, no network communication.",
  "flows": "None; static type definitions without executable code or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations, TypedDicts, Union types, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. There is no runtime logic, data processing, or external communication. The structure follows standard practices for type hinting modules, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, purely declarative set of type definitions for the AWS Pinpoint SDK, posing no security threat or malicious intent.",
