{
  "purpose": "The code provides type definitions for the Amazon Pinpoint SDK in Python, defining data structures used for various API requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Type annotations for request/response data structures, imports from standard libraries and external packages, and the use of Union and TypedDict to define data models.",
  "sinks": "None directly identified; no functions or code execution paths are present that process untrusted input or perform dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "This code mainly establishes data schemas without runtime logic or data flow, thus no source-to-sink data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code strictly consists of type definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of TypedDict definitions and import statements, intended for type hinting in an SDK. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or data manipulation that could be malicious. It imports standard and external libraries, and conditionally adjusts imports based on Python version, which is typical and safe. The code appears to be well-structured for a type definitions module with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for the AWS Pinpoint SDK. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code patterns, and no external communication. It appears safe and primarily serves as a data schema reference.",
