  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is just documentation, import, and aliasing; no data flow, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no security issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with an observation about the future copyright year (2025). No malicious activity or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — perhaps slightly overestimating the risk due to the future date, but it's minor.\n- **Conclusion:** Still benign, the future date is likely a typo or placeholder.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, no suspicious code, just import/export setup. Future date noted again.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern, standard interface module, documentation, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, straightforward interface with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malware or obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify the absence of malware and obfuscation.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly elevated in Report 2 due to the future copyright year, but this is not a security concern; it's more of a documentation or placeholder issue.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No claims of vulnerabilities are made, and none are evident. The code is purely structural, serving as an interface.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code, a risk score of 0.0 or very close to it is appropriate. The minor mention of the future date does not constitute a security risk.\n\n### Overall recommendation:\n\n- The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module.\n- No changes needed in scoring.\n- The scores provided are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Estimated Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware            | 0               |\n| Obfuscated         | 0               |\n| Security Risk      | 0               |\n\n**Final note:** The code appears entirely safe, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The minor anomaly of the future copyright year does not impact security.",
