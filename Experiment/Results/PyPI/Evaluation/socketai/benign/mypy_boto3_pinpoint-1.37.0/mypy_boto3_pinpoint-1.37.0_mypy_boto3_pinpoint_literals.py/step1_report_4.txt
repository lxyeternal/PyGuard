  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS Pinpoint and related service configurations and enumerations using Python type annotations.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions for literal types, import statements for type annotations based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data flows; the code only defines constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely contains static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behavior; no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or hidden logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type aliases using Python's Literal for various string enums related to AWS services. It conditionally imports Literal from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version, which is standard practice. The vast list of string literals appears to be comprehensive and static, with no apparent code that reads external input or writes data. There are no functions, data processing, or runtime logic, only type annotations and constant definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of static type aliases for AWS Pinpoint and other service string literals. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is purely for type annotation purposes and does not perform any data manipulation or network activity.",
