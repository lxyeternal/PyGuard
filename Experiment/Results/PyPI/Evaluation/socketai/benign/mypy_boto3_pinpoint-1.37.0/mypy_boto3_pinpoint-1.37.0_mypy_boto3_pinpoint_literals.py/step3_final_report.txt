  "purpose": "Defines static string literal types for AWS Pinpoint and other AWS services to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals for AWS services, regions, and related constants; no external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "None; static constants only, no data sinks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Static source-to-constant assignments; no dynamic data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious patterns detected; straightforward static type alias definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions using Literal for various AWS constants, with conditional import for Python version compatibility. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify its static, benign nature. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static utility module for type annotations related to AWS services. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
