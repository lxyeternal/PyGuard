  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS and pinpoint service configurations and categories to be used for type checking.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module, version check for typing.Literal import, and definitions of string literal types.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow detected; the code solely establishes type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns identified. The code is purely type annotation definitions with no runtime behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports Literal based on Python version and defines a series of type aliases as Literal types containing predefined string options. These are static type hints for code correctness and do not perform any execution, data processing, or external communication. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The purpose appears to be documentation and type safety support. No obfuscation or malware characteristics are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions for literals, intended for type annotations in a larger codebase. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious external dependencies, and no security risks. It is safe to use as part of the type hinting system.",
