{
  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for various AWS Pinpoint and other AWS service constants to enable type safety and better code clarity.",
  "sources": "Import of sys to check Python version; no external or untrusted data sources; definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no output or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; all definitions are static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code is purely type annotation definitions with conditional import for type hints.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily provides type alias definitions using Literal for better static type checking. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version. All literals are static strings representing AWS resource names, service names, and other constants. There is no dynamic or runtime code execution, no input handling, no data processing, and no external communication. The code is well-structured for its purpose without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, purely declarative module defining type literals for AWS service constants. It does not perform any operations that could be malicious or pose security risks.",
