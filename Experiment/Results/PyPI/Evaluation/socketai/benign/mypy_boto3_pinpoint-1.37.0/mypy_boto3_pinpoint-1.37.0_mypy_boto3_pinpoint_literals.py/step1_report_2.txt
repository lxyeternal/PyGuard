{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for boto3 pinpoint service configurations and other AWS service identifiers using Python type annotations.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals assigned to variables such as ActionType, RegionName, ServiceName, etc.",
  "sinks": "There are no runtime data sinks or input points; the code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard type annotations and conditional imports for compatibility, with no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type alias definitions for various AWS-related string literals, conditionally importing 'Literal' depending on Python version. It only contains static constant definitions and module metadata. No user input, network communication, or runtime evaluation is present. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The structure is typical for type hinting modules in SDKs or libraries, and no obfuscation or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard type annotation module defining string literal types for AWS services and regions. There is no malicious intent, no suspicious activity, and no security risks present.",
