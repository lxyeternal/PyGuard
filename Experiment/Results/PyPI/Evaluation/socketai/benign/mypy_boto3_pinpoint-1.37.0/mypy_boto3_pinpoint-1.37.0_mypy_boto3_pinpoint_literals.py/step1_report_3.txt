{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS Pinpoint service configurations and related constants for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Constants defining string literals, import statements for 'sys' and 'typing' modules, conditional import based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially dangerous operations. No data handling or external output present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows observed; the code only defines static type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import structure for compatibility; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. Usage of conditional import is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static definitions module establishing string literal types for use elsewhere. It imports standard modules and defines a large set of constants for type annotations. No external input, output, or dynamic behaviors are present. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage. The code appears to be a straightforward type hinting utility for AWS SDK configurations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily defining type annotations for AWS service identifiers and configurations. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected. It serves as a static type hinting utility, with standard imports and no suspicious code segments.",
