{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Sphinx documentation extension that provides a custom 'prompt' directive for syntax highlighting code snippets with prompts, supporting various languages and auto prompt detection.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include self.content (lines of code within the directive), options such as 'language', 'prompts', 'modifiers', and arguments passed to the directive.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the highlighted HTML and LaTeX outputs generated via Pygments, and CSS styles injected into the HTML. No data is used in system calls, network operations, or file writes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from self.content through syntax highlighting functions, with prompt detection and processing modifying the input lines, ultimately leading to HTML/LaTeX output. There are no external system or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard libraries and methods for syntax highlighting. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a syntax highlighting extension for Sphinx with prompt support. It handles input prompts, manages prompt caches, applies syntax highlighting, and generates HTML/LaTeX outputs. The use of standard libraries and straightforward processing indicates no malicious intent. No suspicious external interactions or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign Sphinx extension aimed at enhancing documentation with prompt-aware syntax highlighting. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior detected.",
