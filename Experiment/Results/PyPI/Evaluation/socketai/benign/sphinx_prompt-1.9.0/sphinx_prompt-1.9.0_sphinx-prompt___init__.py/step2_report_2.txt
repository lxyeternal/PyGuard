  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues Present?** No, the code is a Sphinx extension for rendering prompts with syntax highlighting. No malicious or vulnerable code detected.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None apparent; the reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Given the benign nature, the risk score could be lowered to 0.1 or 0.\n- **Justification for higher risk?** No, the code is safe.\n- **Malware Score?** Correctly 0.\n- **Assumptions?** None; the analysis is based on static code review.\n- **Scores consistency?** Yes.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues Present?** No, similar to Report 1, the code is a benign Sphinx extension.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Slightly conservative; could be lowered.\n- **Justification?** No malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score?** Correct.\n- **Assumptions?** None.\n- **Scores consistency?** Yes.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues Present?** No, straightforward syntax highlighting extension.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Justification?** No malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score?** Correct.\n- **Assumptions?** None.\n- **Scores consistency?** Yes.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues Present?** No, the analysis confirms no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Justification?** Safe code.\n- **Malware Score?** Correct.\n- **Assumptions?** None.\n- **Scores consistency?** Yes.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues Present?** No, similar benign extension.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Justification?** No malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score?** Correct.\n- **Assumptions?** None.\n- **Scores consistency?** Yes.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malware (0).\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation (0).\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly conservative but acceptable; the code is purely for documentation rendering and contains no security issues.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across the board.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across the board.\n- **Risk:** Given the nature, a very low score like 0.1 is appropriate; some reports suggest 0.2, which is acceptable but could be lowered.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard, safe Sphinx extension for rendering prompts with syntax highlighting.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or vulnerable aspects are present.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable; I would recommend setting malware and obfuscated scores to 0, and risk scores to around 0.1 for conservativeness.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\nThis reflects a benign, well-implemented documentation utility with no security concerns.",
