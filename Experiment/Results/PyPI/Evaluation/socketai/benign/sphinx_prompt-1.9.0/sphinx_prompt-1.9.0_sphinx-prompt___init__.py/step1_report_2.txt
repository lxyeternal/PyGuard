  "purpose": "The code defines a Sphinx extension for rendering code prompts with syntax highlighting and prompt styling in documentation.",
  "sources": "User-provided directive content (`self.content`), directive options (`language`, `prompts`, `modifiers`), and argument inputs.",
  "sinks": "The code generates HTML and LaTeX output for documentation; no direct data sinks or external network calls are present.",
  "flows": "User content is processed, highlighted, and embedded within generated HTML/LaTeX; no external data flow or untrusted data transmission is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns; no obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The script implements a Sphinx directive that formats and highlights code snippets with prompts. It uses static prompt definitions and lexer selection, with no external network interaction or data exfiltration. The code uses standard libraries and syntax highlighting tools (pygments). No dynamic execution of untrusted input, no suspicious code patterns, and no hidden backdoors are identified. The logic flows are straightforward, with proper separation of concerns. No security-sensitive operations like database access, file manipulation, or environment variable misuse are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign Sphinx extension for styling code prompts in documentation. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It operates solely within the context of generating formatted documentation output. The security risk is negligible.",
