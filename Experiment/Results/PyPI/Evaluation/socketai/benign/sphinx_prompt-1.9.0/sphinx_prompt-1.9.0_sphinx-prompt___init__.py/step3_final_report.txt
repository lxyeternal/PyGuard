{
  "purpose": "Provides a custom 'prompt' directive for Sphinx documentation, enabling styled code prompts with syntax highlighting and prompt management.",
  "sources": "User content lines, directive options ('language', 'prompts', 'modifiers').",
  "sinks": "Generated HTML and LaTeX output containing styled code snippets.",
  "flows": "Content lines are processed and highlighted; prompts are styled via CSS classes; output is injected into HTML/LaTeX documents.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected. No external data or network activity. The code relies on standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign Sphinx extension for rendering styled prompts with syntax highlighting. It manages prompt styles via a cache, processes user content with Pygments, and outputs styled HTML and LaTeX. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or external communications are present. The only potential concern is injection of malicious CSS or LaTeX if inputs are crafted maliciously, but this is typical in documentation rendering and mitigated by the use of pygments and controlled output. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses standard libraries, with no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard Sphinx extension for styled prompt rendering. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
