  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign Sphinx extension for rendering prompts with syntax highlighting. No malicious activity, external calls, or obfuscation are present.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The code is primarily text processing and styling, with no external network activity or malicious patterns. The scores are appropriate.  \n**No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a legitimate extension with prompt styling, syntax highlighting, and no malicious behavior. Slightly lower confidence but still high.  \n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0.1, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The minor securityRisk score (0.1) accounts for potential misuse of HTML styling if inputs are malicious, but this is standard and not malicious per se. The malware score remains zero.  \n**No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a safe Sphinx extension with no malicious patterns, external calls, or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0.2, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, reasoning is sound. The small securityRisk score reflects minimal risk in styling or rendering, but no actual vulnerabilities.  \n**No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—benign extension, no malicious behavior, standard library use, safe processing.  \n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0.0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is consistent and well-justified. The securityRisk is zero, which aligns with the analysis.  \n**No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Also confirms that the code is a standard Sphinx extension with no malicious activity, external network calls, or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0.1, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is appropriate. The small securityRisk accounts for potential misuse of HTML styling but not actual malicious activity.  \n**No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. No malicious code, external calls, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation (0.0 to 0.2). Given the code's nature—text processing, styling, syntax highlighting—these small scores are reasonable. The minor risk stems from potential styling misuse if inputs are malicious, but this is a common concern in documentation tools, not an actual vulnerability.\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (No malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (Code is straightforward)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (Slight potential for styling misuse, but no real risk)\n\n**This code is a benign, well-structured Sphinx extension for rendering prompts with syntax highlighting.**",
