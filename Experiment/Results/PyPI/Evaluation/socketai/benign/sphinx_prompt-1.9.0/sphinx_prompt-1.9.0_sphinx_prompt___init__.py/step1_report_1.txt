{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Sphinx extension for rendering code prompts with syntax highlighting and prompt styles in documentation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from self.content (input code lines), options provided in directives, and predefined prompt strings.",
  "sinks": "Uses Pygments for syntax highlighting, outputs HTML and LaTeX nodes containing processed code.",
  "flows": "Input code lines are processed, highlighted, and wrapped in HTML/LaTeX with prompt styles; data flows from self.content through syntax highlighter to output nodes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious external network calls; no code injections or obfuscated code; the code mainly handles text processing and styling.",
  "analysis": "The script is a Sphinx extension defining a directive for rendering code prompts with syntax highlighting. It manages prompt styles via a cache and processes code lines for auto or manual prompts, generating HTML and LaTeX output. No external data fetching or network activity is observed. The code does not contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behavior; it primarily performs safe text manipulation and formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign Sphinx extension aimed at enhancing code block presentation with prompts. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks present in the code. Its functionality is limited to styling and syntax highlighting, with no malicious behavior detected.",
