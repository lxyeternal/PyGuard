  "purpose": "Provides a Sphinx extension directive to render code snippets with prompts, syntax highlighting, and styling for documentation.",
  "sources": "Reads code lines from content, options for language, prompts, and modifiers.",
  "sinks": "Outputs styled HTML and LaTeX code with embedded CSS classes and syntax highlighting.",
  "flows": "Processes input lines, applies prompt styles, highlights syntax, and generates styled output for HTML and LaTeX.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, or external activity; straightforward logic; potential minor injection points in HTML styling but standard for documentation tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, well-structured Sphinx extension for rendering prompts with syntax highlighting. It manages prompt styles via a cache, supports multiple languages, and produces HTML and LaTeX outputs. No external network calls, dynamic code execution, or credential handling are present. The logic is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. Minor security considerations relate to potential injection in HTML styles, but this is typical and not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0–0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign Sphinx extension for rendering code snippets with prompts and syntax highlighting. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The low risk scores are justified given the context. No improvements or changes are necessary.",
