  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no secrets, no external calls. The code is a benign Sphinx extension for styling prompts.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no external calls, straightforward prompt styling and syntax highlighting.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk (0.1) due to potential injection via HTML styles, but overall benign. The score seems reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to above; standard syntax highlighting, prompt management, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk, justified given potential for HTML injection if inputs are malicious, but no actual malicious code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, standard use of Pygments, prompt cache, safe processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent; no issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; safe processing, no external calls or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk, reasonable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0. The code does not execute external code, network calls, or contain obfuscated/malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly elevated in some reports (0.1–0.2), mainly due to potential injection points in HTML output, but these are typical in documentation tools and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential for HTML injection if inputs are malicious, but no actual exploitation, I would set this at **0.1** — low but acknowledging possible injection vectors in documentation rendering.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, well-structured Sphinx extension for rendering prompts with syntax highlighting. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The minor security risk stems from the fact that it outputs HTML with embedded styles and highlighted code, which could be misused if inputs are maliciously crafted, but this is standard in such tools.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment aligns with all reports and the code's functionality.",
