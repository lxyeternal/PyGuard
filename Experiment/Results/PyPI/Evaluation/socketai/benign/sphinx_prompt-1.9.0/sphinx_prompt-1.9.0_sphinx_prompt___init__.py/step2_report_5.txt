  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign Sphinx extension for rendering prompts with syntax highlighting. No malicious activity, external calls, or obfuscation are present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Not unreasonable given the analysis.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; no suspicious behavior detected. The risk score of 0 aligns with the benign assessment.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, no external activity, and straightforward prompt management.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. The small risk score reflects potential concern about HTML/CSS injection, but this is typical in documentation tools and not malicious.\n- **Justification:** The analysis correctly notes no malicious intent, and the slight risk score seems appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the benign nature, standard library usage, and lack of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Slightly higher but still reasonable, considering potential minimal risks in HTML styling.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is consistent; the small risk score is acceptable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Confirms no malicious behavior, standard syntax highlighting, and safe input handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0. Fully aligned with the benign assessment.\n- **Justification:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard syntax highlighting extension, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Slightly elevated but acceptable.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the overall benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which is consistent with the code's behavior—mainly text processing, syntax highlighting, and styling.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.0 to 0.2) mainly due to potential CSS/HTML injection concerns, which are typical in such rendering code and not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Minor potential for styling or injection issues, but within normal bounds for documentation rendering tools.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, well-structured Sphinx extension for rendering prompts with syntax highlighting. No security risks or malicious activity are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always consider that in a real security review, if the code interacts with untrusted input, proper sanitization should be ensured. However, in this case, the input is mainly code snippets and style options, which are standard in documentation tools.",
