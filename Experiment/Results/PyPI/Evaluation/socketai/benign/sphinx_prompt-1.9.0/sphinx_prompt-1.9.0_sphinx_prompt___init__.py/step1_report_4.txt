{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Sphinx extension that processes custom 'prompt' directives to highlight code snippets with prompts for different shell or programming languages, generating HTML and LaTeX outputs.",
  "sources": "User-provided content lines within the 'self.content' list, directive options ('language', 'prompts', 'modifiers'), and the 'self.arguments' list.",
  "sinks": "Highlighting functions that process code lines; rendering functions that generate HTML and LaTeX; the 'highlight' function from 'pygments' which processes code content.",
  "flows": "Content lines are read from 'self.content' and processed with the specified lexer; prompt options influence how lines are parsed and styled; highlighted output is generated and injected into HTML and LaTeX templates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors present. The code uses standard library functions and third-party libraries appropriately. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected. The prompt handling and highlighting are straightforward, with no suspicious code flow.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured Sphinx directive implementation for syntax highlighting with prompts. It uses standard libraries and known third-party modules without any suspicious imports or code patterns. The prompt cache manages styling classes and prompts effectively. Content processing involves splitting lines and applying syntax highlighting, with no evidence of malicious behavior. No network activity, system modifications, or data leaks are present. All functions serve legitimate formatting purposes, and there are no indications of malicious intent or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign Sphinx extension for rendering code snippets with prompts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It handles inputs and outputs safely within its scope, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors.",
