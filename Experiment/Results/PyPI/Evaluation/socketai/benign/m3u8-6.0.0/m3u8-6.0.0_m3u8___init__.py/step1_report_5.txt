  "purpose": "This code provides functions to parse and load M3U8 playlist content from strings, URLs, or files, returning M3U8 objects.",
  "sources": "Reading from input parameters 'content' and 'uri'; reading file content with open()",
  "sinks": "Creating M3U8 objects, calling http_client.download() which retrieves external data",
  "flows": "Content and URI inputs → 'loads' or 'load' functions → data retrieval from URL or file → M3U8 object creation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of standard library functions; no obfuscated code; no hidden network connections or file modifications",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions to load M3U8 playlist data from different sources: directly from string input, HTTP(S) URLs, or local files. The 'load' function fetches remote data via a provided HTTP client, which is a standard pattern. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The use of 'os.path.dirname' and standard file handling reduces concern for malicious file access. External dependencies such as 'm3u8' and 'DefaultHTTPClient' are common and are not inherently malicious. There are no indicators of malicious intent or malicious obfuscation. The code appears to serve as a normal utility module for M3U8 playlist processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility module for handling M3U8 playlist data. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It primarily reads data from strings, URLs, or files and returns structured objects. No suspicious signals or malicious patterns are detected.",
