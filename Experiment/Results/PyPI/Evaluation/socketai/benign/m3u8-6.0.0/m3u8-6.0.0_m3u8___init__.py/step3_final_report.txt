{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to load and parse m3u8 playlist data from strings, URLs, or files, returning M3U8 objects.",
  "sources": "String content input, URL via download, local file via open()",
  "sinks": "None; data is processed internally, no untrusted data is executed or leaked",
  "flows": "Content is read from input sources, passed to M3U8 constructor, with optional base_uri set from URL or file path",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility for playlist handling, relying on external libraries and safe file/network operations. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. Network fetches are via a trusted HTTP client interface, and file reads specify encoding. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified. The code's purpose is benign, and the data flow is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. It handles untrusted input sources but does not perform any malicious actions. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly zero.",
