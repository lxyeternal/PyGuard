  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured M3U8 playlist parser with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The current scores are appropriate; the malware score should remain at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). It is safe for use in supply chain contexts, with no security concerns identified."
