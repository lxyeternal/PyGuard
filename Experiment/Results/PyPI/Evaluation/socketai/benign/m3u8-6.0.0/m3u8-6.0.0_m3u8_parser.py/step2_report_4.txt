  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the code as a standard M3U8 parser, with no malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network/system actions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The parser processes playlist data, extracting attributes, segments, and metadata.\n- No code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident.\n- The use of regex and string parsing is typical for such parsers.\n- The low risk score (0.2) seems appropriate given the absence of dangerous operations.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. The scores are reasonable. No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard parsing, no malicious activity, and no external system interactions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code handles untrusted input lines but does not perform unsafe actions.\n- Quote removal and regex splitting are typical; no malicious intent.\n- The report correctly identifies the lack of external system impact.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, describes a standard parser with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The parser only reads and processes playlist data.\n- No external calls, no data leaks, no code execution.\n- The risk score is even lower here, which aligns with the findings.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment. No changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, confirming safe, standard parsing behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No network, file, or system command activity.\n- Handles URIs and attributes as data, not as code.\n- No malicious indicators.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms a standard parser, no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Same reasoning as above; the code is a straightforward playlist parser.\n- No signs of malicious intent or sabotage.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, well-structured M3U8 playlist parser.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or dangerous external actions are present.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are consistent with their assessments and justified.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 - 0.2 (very low, given the nature of the code)  \n\nThe code is a legitimate parser for media playlists, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The scores are reasonable, and no further adjustments are necessary. The supply chain security risk is minimal based on the provided code and analysis.",
