The code does not exhibit malicious intent or obfuscation, and the risks are limited to minor coding flaws."

The unconventional __new__ implementation is likely a coding mistake rather than obfuscation or malicious intent. Overall, no malware or malicious behavior is detected, but the insecure SSL configuration warrants caution."
