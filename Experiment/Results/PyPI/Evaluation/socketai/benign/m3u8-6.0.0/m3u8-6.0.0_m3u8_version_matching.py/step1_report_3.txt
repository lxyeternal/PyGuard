{
  "purpose": "The code appears to parse and validate lines from a file, specifically checking for version information and applying validation rules to each line based on the detected version.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'file_lines' parameter, which is a list of strings representing lines from a file.",
  "sinks": "The code processes the data internally; there are no obvious sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. It does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "The source (file_lines) flows into get_version() to extract version info, then into validate() which applies rules to each line based on the version; no external sinks or output beyond returning validation errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and uses imported validation rules. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports validation rules from an external module and applies version-specific validation to each line of a file. It only reads and processes data without performing any network operations, system modifications, or suspicious activities. The functions are standard and do not contain malicious patterns. There are no hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors. The logic is simple and focused on validation tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign validation utility for parsing version information and validating lines based on version-specific rules. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk score is minimal, and the likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
