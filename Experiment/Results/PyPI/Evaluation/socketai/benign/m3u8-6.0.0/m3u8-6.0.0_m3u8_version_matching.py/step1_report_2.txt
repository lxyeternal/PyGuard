  "purpose": "Parse and validate lines of an M3U8 playlist file based on version rules.",
  "sources": "Reads lines from a provided list of strings representing a playlist file.",
  "sinks": "Calls validation methods on rules which may perform checks; no direct sinks for untrusted data or system commands.",
  "flows": "Reads version from file lines -> Applies rules validation -> Collects errors",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily parses playlist version info and validates lines against a set of rules. It uses standard string operations, iterates over data, and applies validation rules. No external data sources or system commands are invoked. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The functions and imports appear standard for validation logic. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward playlist validation utility without malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious data handling. It operates solely on input data and predefined rules, with no suspicious behavior.",
