{
  "purpose": "This code parses lines from an m3u8 playlist file to extract version information and validate each line against a set of rules based on the detected version.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a list of strings representing lines in a playlist file, specifically searching for version information and the content of each line.",
  "sinks": "Calls validation functions on each line, but no untrusted data flows into security-sensitive sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Extracts version from lines starting with a specific protocol extension, then validates each line against rules depending on this version.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious control flow observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward parsing and validation tasks. It imports external modules for version matching and protocol handling. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. Validation is performed through externally defined rules, which are assumed to be safe. No malicious behavior or malicious data manipulation detected. The code structure and logic are clear and standard for such parsing and validation tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for validating m3u8 playlist files against version-dependent rules. No signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks are evident.",
