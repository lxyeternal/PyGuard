  "purpose": "Parse playlist lines to extract version info and validate each line against version-dependent rules.",
  "sources": "Lines starting with protocol.ext_x_version for version info; all lines for validation.",
  "sinks": "Validation functions and error collection; no external sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Extract version from specific line -> validate each line against rules based on version -> collect errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly extracts a version number from playlist lines and validates each line against external rules. It does not perform network operations, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted input beyond the provided list. External modules are assumed safe. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The code's logic is simple and transparent, with no suspicious control flow or data leaks. The only minor concern is that if the version line is missing, validation proceeds with None, which may skip validation but does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, version-dependent playlist validator with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk (~0.1) reflects minimal concern given the code's operations and external dependencies.",
