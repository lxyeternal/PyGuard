  "purpose": "Parse and validate lines in an m3u8 playlist file based on version rules.",
  "sources": "Reading input lines from a list of strings, particularly the file_lines parameter.",
  "targets": "No evident sink where untrusted data influences system commands or sensitive data outputs.",
  "flows": "Reading lines to find version info, then validating each line against rules based on version.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code extracts version info from the playlist, then validates each line against multiple rules. It uses straightforward string operations and iterates over input data. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system manipulation. It relies on external modules for validation, which are assumed to be safe. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard validation utility for m3u8 playlist files, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on provided input data with no external side effects.",
