{
  "purpose": "Define constants for parsing or generating HLS playlist files, specifically for variant playlist tags.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string constants representing various EXT-X tags in HLS playlists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; the code does not handle external data or perform data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines static string constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string constant definitions for HLS playlist tags, which are static and do not involve data processing, input/output, or dynamic behavior. There are no functions, external data reads, or executable logic that could be exploited or malicious. It appears to serve as a reference or configuration setup for handling HLS playlists.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static set of constants used for playlist parsing or generation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this code snippet.",
