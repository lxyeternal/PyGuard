{
  "purpose": "Defines static string constants representing HLS playlist tags for use in playlist parsing or generation.",
  "sources": "No input data; static constant definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; constants are used as references, no dynamic or runtime data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants for HLS playlist tags, with no input handling, data processing, or dynamic code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the benign and static nature of the code. The code functions as a reference module and does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and serves as a constants module for HLS playlist tags. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with its purpose and content.",
