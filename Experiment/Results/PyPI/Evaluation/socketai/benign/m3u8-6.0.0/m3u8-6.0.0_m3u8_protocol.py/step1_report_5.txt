{
  "purpose": "Define constants representing various HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) playlist tags for use in playlist parsing or generation.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string constants for playlist tags",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points, as the code only defines constants",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; static constant definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and static with no dynamic code execution or data handling",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string constant assignments for HLS playlist tags. It contains no input/output operations, no dynamic evaluation, no network communication, and no security-sensitive operations. It is a static list of constants that can be used for parsing or generating playlist files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware. The code appears to be part of a larger project related to media playlist management, with no suspicious or malicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static constant definitions for HLS playlist tags with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security threat and serves as a reference or utility module within a larger codebase.",
