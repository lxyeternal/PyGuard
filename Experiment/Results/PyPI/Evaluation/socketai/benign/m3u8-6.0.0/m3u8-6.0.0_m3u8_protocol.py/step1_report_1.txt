{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define a series of string constants representing various tags used in HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) playlist files, specifically MPEG-TS and playlist tags.",
  "sources": "Constants are hardcoded string literals defining playlist tags, not reading external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; it only assigns static string values.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code. All are straightforward string assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines static constants for playlist tags used in media streaming playlists. There is no input processing, no dynamic code, and no external data handling. The purpose seems to be to facilitate playlist parsing or generation. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of constant definitions for playlist tags. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks. It appears to be part of a media streaming library or application.",
