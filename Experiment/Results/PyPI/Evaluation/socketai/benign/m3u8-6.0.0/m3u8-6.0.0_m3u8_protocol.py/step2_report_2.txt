  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to assess the accuracy of their conclusions, the scores assigned, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is static, straightforward, and only defines string constants for HLS playlist tags.\n- No dynamic behavior, input handling, or data processing is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n\n**Code correctness:**\n- The code is a list of constant string definitions for HLS tags.\n- The constants appear accurate and consistent with standard HLS tags.\n- No errors, flaws, or issues are present in the code itself.\n\n**Malicious behavior or security risks:**\n- The code does not perform any data processing, network operations, or dynamic execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n- These are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- The only point to consider is whether the `malware` score should be higher if any malicious intent was suspected. Since none is evident, 0 is correct.\n- The `risk` scores are also appropriately low, as the code is purely declarative.\n\n---\n\n### Justifications for any higher scores:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain 0, no security risk or vulnerabilities are introduced.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **The code is a benign constants module for HLS playlist tags.**\n- **All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious and safe.**\n- **Scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.**\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is safe, non-obfuscated, and contains no malware or security risks. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
