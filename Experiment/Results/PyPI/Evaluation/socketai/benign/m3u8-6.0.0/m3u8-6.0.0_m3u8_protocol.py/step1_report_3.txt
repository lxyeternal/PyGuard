  "purpose": "Define constants for parsing or handling HLS playlist tags.",
  "sources": "None; only string constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only constant assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string variable assignments for HLS playlist tags, which are standard and well-documented. There are no input sources, data processing, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code appears to serve as a constants module for a media playlist parser or generator.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or security-related issues. It functions as a set of string constants for playlist tags, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
