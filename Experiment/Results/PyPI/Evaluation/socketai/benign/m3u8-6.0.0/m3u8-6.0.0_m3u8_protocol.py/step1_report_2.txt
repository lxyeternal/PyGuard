{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of string constants representing various tags used in HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) playlist files.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions, likely used elsewhere in code that processes or generates HLS playlists.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions are present; this code does not handle untrusted data or perform data manipulation.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists within this snippet as it only defines constants; no source-to-sink data pathways are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is straightforward and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of variable assignments for HLS playlist tags, which are standard and static. No input/output handling, no dynamic execution, and no network or file operations are present. The content appears to serve as a configuration or reference for other parts of a larger program. Since it is static and does not process untrusted data, there is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of constant definitions related to HLS playlists, with no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It does not perform any harmful actions or data manipulations.",
