{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads README.md and requirements.txt to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; reads 'requirements.txt' into a list for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Reads files into variables; passes dependencies and metadata to setup() without executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional reading of 'requirements.txt' using a list comprehension over an open file object without parsing lines explicitly; no encoding specified for 'requirements.txt'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. The method of reading 'requirements.txt' is non-standard and may cause runtime errors but does not introduce security risks. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The minor coding flaw is a common mistake but not security-related.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration with minor implementation issues that do not pose security threats. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). The code does not exhibit malicious intent or obfuscation, and the risks are limited to minor coding flaws.",
