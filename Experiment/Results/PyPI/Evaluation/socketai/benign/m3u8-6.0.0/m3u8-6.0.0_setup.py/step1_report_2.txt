{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'm3u8', mainly for installation and distribution purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script mainly reads files and passes data to 'setup()'.",
  "flows": "Reading files ('requirements.txt' and 'README.md') and passing data to setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The way 'install_reqs' is populated is unusual; it reads the entire file object directly into a list without parsing, which may lead to runtime errors. No malicious code or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script loads metadata and dependencies for a Python package, with standard use of 'setuptools'. The 'install_reqs' assignment uses a list comprehension but reads directly from an open file object without calling 'readlines()', which may cause a runtime error rather than a security issue. No external input handling, no code injection, or malicious patterns detected. No obfuscated code or malware indicators present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with a minor implementation issue in dependency loading. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified.",
