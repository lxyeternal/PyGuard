{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the Python package 'm3u8', including reading dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None that process untrusted data into insecure operations; primarily file reads and package setup.",
  "flows": "File reads for description and dependencies, then passing dependencies to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "The code reads 'requirements.txt' without sanitization or error handling, but this is typical for setup scripts; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package metadata and dependencies in a standard manner for Python packaging. It conditionally reads 'README.md' to set long description, and reads 'requirements.txt' to get dependencies. The code uses standard 'setuptools' setup procedure. No dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, and no hardcoded credentials. The approach appears straightforward and intended solely for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical package metadata and dependency reading without any suspicious operations.",
