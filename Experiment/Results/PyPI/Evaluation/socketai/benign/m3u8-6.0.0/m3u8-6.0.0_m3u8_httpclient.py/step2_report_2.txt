  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  The code matches the description. The unconventional use of `__new__` in `HTTPSHandler` is noted. No malicious payloads or suspicious behavior are detected. The security concern about disabling SSL verification is valid but not malicious.\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  The main flaw is the misuse of `__new__`, which could cause runtime issues, but it's not malicious.\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — correct, no malicious activity.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — code appears straightforward.  \n  SecurityRisk: 0.4 — justified due to insecure SSL handling.  \n  The overall assessment aligns with the report.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Similar to Report 1, no malicious activity. The SSL verification can be disabled, which is insecure but not malicious.\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  No significant errors besides insecure SSL handling.\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — code is clear.  \n  SecurityRisk: 0.2 — reasonable, given the insecure SSL option.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Same pattern: no malware, insecure SSL verification is the main concern.\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  The use of `__new__` remains unconventional but not malicious.\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — consistent.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — straightforward code.  \n  SecurityRisk: 0.2 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No malicious activity detected. The insecure SSL option is a security concern but not malicious.\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  No significant flaws beyond insecure SSL handling.\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n  SecurityRisk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Same as above, no malicious behavior. The main concern is insecure SSL verification.\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  No, aside from the insecure SSL option.\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n  SecurityRisk: 0.3 — reasonable given the insecure SSL toggle.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is a standard HTTP client with a flawed implementation of `HTTPSHandler` but no malware or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The main concern is the insecure SSL verification when `verify_ssl=False`. While this introduces security risks (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks), it does not constitute malicious activity.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — moderate security risk due to insecure SSL verification, which is common but should be used cautiously.\n\n### **Final notes:**\n- The unconventional use of `__new__` in `HTTPSHandler` is a coding mistake rather than malicious obfuscation.\n- The disabling of SSL verification is a security concern but not malicious.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, straightforward HTTP client with some insecure configurations. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
