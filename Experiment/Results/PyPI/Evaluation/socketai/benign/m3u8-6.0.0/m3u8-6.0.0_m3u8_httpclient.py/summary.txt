  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with a notable security concern due to insecure SSL verification handling. The unconventional __new__ implementation is likely a coding mistake rather than obfuscation or malicious intent. Overall, no malware or malicious behavior is detected, but the insecure SSL configuration warrants caution."
