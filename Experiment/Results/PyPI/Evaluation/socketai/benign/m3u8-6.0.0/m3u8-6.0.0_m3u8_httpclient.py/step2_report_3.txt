  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code's core logic matches the description. The only notable anomaly is the use of `__new__` in `HTTPSHandler` with a `self` parameter, which is unconventional. The report correctly identifies this as a potential mistake rather than malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Security risk:** 0.4 — justified, since disabling SSL verification (`verify_ssl=False`) is insecure, but not malicious.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; no malware detected, but insecure SSL handling is a concern.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment and scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to report 1, the core logic matches. No malicious behavior is identified.\n- **Anomalies:** The unconventional `__new__` method is noted, but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, security risk at 0.2 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, with insecure SSL verification being a potential risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores and reasoning are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Again, the core logic is consistent. The unusual `__new__` method is highlighted but not deemed malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2 — consistent.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward HTTP client with no malicious intent, with the caveat of insecure SSL verification.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar findings; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Anomalies:** The `__new__` method is unconventional but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, with potential security concerns due to SSL verification toggling.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others; the core logic is consistent.\n- **Anomalies:** The use of `__new__` remains unconventional but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.3 — acceptable given the insecure SSL handling.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.2–0.4), justified by insecure SSL verification practices, which are security concerns but not malicious.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\nGiven the consistent findings across all reports, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — considering the insecure SSL verification, which is a common security concern but not malicious.\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is benign but insecure in its SSL handling. The scores across reports are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.",
