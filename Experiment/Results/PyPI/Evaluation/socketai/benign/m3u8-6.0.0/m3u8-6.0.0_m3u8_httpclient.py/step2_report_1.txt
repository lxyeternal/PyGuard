  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code, and then synthesize an overall evaluation.\n\n**1. Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes the code's intent and data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Correctly notes the unconventional use of `__new__` with a `self` parameter, which is indeed unusual and could cause issues.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that no malicious activity is evident but highlights insecure SSL handling when `verify_ssl=False`. The confidence level (0.8) is reasonable.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.4 seem appropriate given the insecure SSL configuration but no malicious behavior.\n\n**2. Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes the unconventional `__new__` method but emphasizes that it’s not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately finds no malicious intent, with a slightly lower security risk score (0.2) reflecting that.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2 are reasonable.\n\n**3. Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Again mentions the unconventional `__new__` but finds no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Consistent with previous assessments; the main concern remains the insecure SSL verification toggle.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**4. Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Similar to others, notes the unusual `__new__` implementation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious activity; security concern is the optional SSL verification disabling.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2 fit.\n\n**5. Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Same note on `__new__`.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Consistent; no malicious behavior, but the insecure SSL handling is flagged.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.3 are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence of malware or malicious payloads:** No evidence in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security Risks:** The main concern is the optional disabling of SSL verification (`verify_ssl=False`), which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks if misused, but this is a common insecure practice rather than malicious code.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting the insecure SSL handling. These are reasonable, given the potential security implications but no active malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** Considering the code's insecure SSL handling and unconventional implementation, I would assign a slightly higher risk score than the highest in reports, perhaps **0.4**. This reflects the security concern but not malicious intent.\n\n**Malware & Obfuscated scores** remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious payloads or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward HTTP client with insecure SSL verification options.\n- No malware or malicious intent is evident.\n- The unconventional use of `__new__` is likely a coding mistake rather than obfuscation.\n- The security risk is moderate due to SSL verification disabling, which could be exploited if misused.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n**Malware score: 0**  \n**Obfuscated score: 0**  \n**Risk score: 0.4**",
