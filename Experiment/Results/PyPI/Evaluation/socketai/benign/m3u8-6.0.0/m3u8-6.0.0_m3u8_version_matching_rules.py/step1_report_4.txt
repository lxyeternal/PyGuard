  "purpose": "Define version validation rules for m3u8 playlist features based on protocol version.",
  "sources": "Code reads its own class attributes, method calls, and imported modules; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Code logic flows through class initialization, validation methods, and rule checks, without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for version validation rules related to m3u8 playlist features, using standard Python constructs. No external inputs, no network or file I/O. The validation logic checks line content against protocol features and version requirements. No suspicious or malicious code, no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The import statement from 'm3u8 import protocol' suggests dependency on external library, but not suspicious in itself. No obfuscated code or hidden logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of validation rules for m3u8 playlist features, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
