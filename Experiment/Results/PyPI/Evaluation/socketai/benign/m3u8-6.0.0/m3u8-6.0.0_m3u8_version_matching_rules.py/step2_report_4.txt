  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code validates m3u8 playlist lines for version compatibility, relying on static class attributes, method parameters, and the imported `protocol`.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data output or external data flow; internal validation with exception raising.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The dependency on `protocol` is standard for such validation routines.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign validation utility, no malware or security risk.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The code is straightforward, purpose-specific, and secure.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code performs validation based on playlist features and protocol version.  \n- No anomalies, malicious behavior, or external data leaks.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The analysis aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Focuses on validation of specific playlist features, with no external data or malicious intent.  \n- The import of `protocol` is standard for feature detection.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Similar validation logic, no anomalies or malicious patterns.  \n- No external threats or obfuscation detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Again, straightforward validation, no suspicious behavior, no external communication, or data exfiltration.  \n- No anomalies or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The code is purely validation logic with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation or code hiding techniques are present. The code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the above, the overall security risk is negligible, as the code does not perform any harmful actions, data leaks, or system modifications.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Based on the comprehensive review, I would assign the following scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (No malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (Code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk:** **0** (No security risk identified)\n\n**Note:** All reports correctly reflect this assessment. The code is a benign validation utility for m3u8 playlist features and version enforcement, with no indication of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
