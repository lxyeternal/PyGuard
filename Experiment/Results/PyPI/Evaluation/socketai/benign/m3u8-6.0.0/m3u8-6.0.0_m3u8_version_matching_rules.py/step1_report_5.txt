{
  "purpose": "This code defines validation rules for version compatibility in an HLS playlist parser, providing exception handling and rule enforcement based on protocol versions and playlist line contents.",
  "sources": "Imports modules ('dataclasses', 'typing', 'm3u8.protocol'), and reads playlist lines ('line' parameter in validation classes).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs; primarily performs internal validation and exception generation.",
  "flows": "Reads playlist line content, checks for specific tags or values, and compares protocol version to enforce compatibility rules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The code uses standard validation patterns without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines validation classes that check for specific playlist features against protocol version requirements. It uses standard exception handling, class inheritance, and list of rule classes. No external network calls, data leaks, or system modifications are observed. The code relies on imported 'protocol' variables but does not manipulate them in an unsafe manner. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of validation rules for an HLS playlist parser, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs internal checks and exception handling without external communications or data exfiltration.",
