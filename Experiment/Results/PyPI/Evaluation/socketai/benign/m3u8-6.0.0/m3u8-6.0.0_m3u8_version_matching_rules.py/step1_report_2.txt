{
  "purpose": "The code defines validation rules for version compatibility in an m3u8 playlist parser, ensuring that certain features are used with appropriate protocol versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class attributes, the imported 'protocol' module, and input lines passed to validation methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or output untrusted data; it mainly performs internal validation and raises custom exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input lines are checked against feature flags; validation depends on features present in the line and the current protocol version, but no external untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward, focusing on validation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements version validation rules for an m3u8 playlist. It imports 'protocol' for feature detection and defines error handling via custom exceptions. Validation methods check if certain features are used and whether the current protocol version meets the minimum requirements. The rules are encapsulated in classes and organized in a list. No external data processing, network operations, or sensitive data handling occurs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The logic is clear, standard, and only related to internal validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, purpose-specific validation utility for playlist feature-version compatibility. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is negligible.",
