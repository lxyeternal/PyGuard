{
  "purpose": "This code defines validation rules for m3u8 playlist lines, ensuring feature usage complies with specified protocol versions. It raises custom exceptions when validation fails.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'line' parameter passed to validation classes and checks for feature presence via the 'protocol' module attributes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not output data or interact with external systems. It only raises exceptions internally.",
  "flows": "Source (line content and protocol feature detection) flows into validation logic, which either returns True or raises an exception; no external data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation checks based on playlist features and protocol version requirements. It relies on external 'protocol' attributes for feature detection. No external data, network activity, or system modifications are involved. The exception handling is used solely for validation errors. The logic is clear, purpose-specific, and free of malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured validation utility for m3u8 playlist features. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The dependency on 'protocol' is typical for such validation routines. The overall security risk is negligible.",
