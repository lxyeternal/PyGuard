{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and validation rules for checking version compatibility in m3u8 playlist lines, specifically for ensuring certain features are used with appropriate protocol versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class attributes, method arguments (version, line number, line content), and imported modules (m3u8.protocol). No user input or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output, network communication, or write operations. It primarily raises custom exceptions for validation errors.",
  "flows": "Input data (version, line content) flows through validation methods, which generate errors if version requirements are not met. No external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The code strictly implements validation logic without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of validation rules for m3u8 playlist versions, relying on static attributes and method checks. It raises custom exceptions for version mismatches but does not perform any network, file, or system modifications. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; the code's logic is clear and purpose-driven. The import of 'protocol' suggests dependency on external module attributes, but that does not pose security concerns in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign validation utility for m3u8 playlist version compliance. It does not contain malware, malicious code, or security risks. It functions solely to enforce version rules based on playlist features.",
