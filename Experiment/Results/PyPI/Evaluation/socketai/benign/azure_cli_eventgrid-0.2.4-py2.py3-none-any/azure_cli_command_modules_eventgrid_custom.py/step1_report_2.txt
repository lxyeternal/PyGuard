{
  "purpose": "The code provides CLI commands and helper functions for managing Azure Event Grid topics, domains, event subscriptions, and resource scopes.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters, user-supplied resource IDs, resource group names, and endpoint URLs.",
  "sinks": "Uses client API calls to Azure management services; potential for data leaks if sensitive info is logged or exposed, but no explicit data exfiltration code observed.",
  "flows": "User inputs → validation and resource scope resolution → API client calls to Azure → resource creation, update, or retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. Uses regex for endpoint parsing; no obfuscated code detected. Warning logs are informative but not malicious. No code injection or data leakage mechanisms observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of CLI command handlers for Azure Event Grid, with helper functions for scope resolution, resource creation, and validation. It performs resource management tasks, input validation, and logging. No suspicious or malicious logic such as network communication to untrusted domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The regex parsing for endpoint URLs is straightforward and intended for resource ID extraction. Error handling and validation are appropriate, focusing on correct resource formats and IDs. No evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or sabotage. The code adheres to best practices for resource management and input validation, with no indications of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be legitimate CLI helper functions for Azure Event Grid management, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard patterns for resource scope calculation, input validation, and API interactions, and does not contain any malicious behavior or backdoors.",
