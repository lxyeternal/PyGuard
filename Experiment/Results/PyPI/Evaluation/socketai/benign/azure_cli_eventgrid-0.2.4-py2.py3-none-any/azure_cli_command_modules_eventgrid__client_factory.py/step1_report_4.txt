  "purpose": "Define factory functions for creating Azure EventGrid management clients and their specific resource factories.",
  "sources": "Import statements, function parameters (cli_ctx, _), and function calls to get_mgmt_service_client and client attributes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "Function calls to get_mgmt_service_client with cli_ctx, then accessing client attributes for various resource types.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code appears standard for Azure SDK usage.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward factory functions importing necessary modules and returning specific clients or resource collections from Azure SDK. No untrusted data input handling, no dynamic code execution, nor suspicious behaviors are present. No indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks. The code is well-structured and adheres to common Azure SDK patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of factory functions for Azure EventGrid management resources with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
