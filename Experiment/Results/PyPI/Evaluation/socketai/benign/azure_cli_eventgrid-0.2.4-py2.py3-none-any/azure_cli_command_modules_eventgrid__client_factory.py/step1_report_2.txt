  "purpose": "Provides factory functions to create clients for Azure EventGrid management services.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and calls functions to create service clients, primarily from azure.mgmt.eventgrid and azure.cli.core.commands.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "The functions instantiate service clients that could be used elsewhere in the application; no data flows are visible within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and typical for Azure SDK usage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several factory functions that return specific clients from the Azure SDK for managing EventGrid resources. It imports necessary modules within functions to avoid top-level dependencies. There are no signs of data manipulation, obfuscation, or malicious activities. The code appears to serve as a simple abstraction layer for Azure resource management, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard factory setup for Azure SDK clients with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is safe and typical for cloud management tasks.",
