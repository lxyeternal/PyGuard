  "purpose": "Factory functions for creating Azure EventGrid management clients within CLI context.",
  "sources": "Import statements within functions, passing 'cli_ctx' as parameter.",
  "sinks": "Return of SDK client instances; no data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input 'cli_ctx' used to instantiate and return SDK clients; no untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward factory functions importing SDK modules and returning client instances based on provided context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations beyond SDK client creation, or contain any suspicious logic. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SDK client factory functions with no malicious intent or security issues. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
