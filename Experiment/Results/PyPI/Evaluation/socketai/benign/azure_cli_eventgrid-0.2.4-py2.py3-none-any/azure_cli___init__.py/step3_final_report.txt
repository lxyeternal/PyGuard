  "purpose": "Declare a namespace in a Python package to enable multiple distributions to share a common namespace.",
  "sources": "Import of pkg_resources module",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication",
  "flows": "Import of pkg_resources → declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward namespace declaration, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace using declare_namespace(__name__). It is a standard pattern for Python namespace packages, with no input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code is minimal, clear, and aligns with common package infrastructure practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its purpose and lack of suspicious activity. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
