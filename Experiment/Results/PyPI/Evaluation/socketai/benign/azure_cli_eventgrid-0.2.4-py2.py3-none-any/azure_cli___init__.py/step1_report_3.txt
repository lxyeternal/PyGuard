  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, enabling the package to be part of a namespace package setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package's __name__ to declare a namespace, which is a standard operation during package initialization.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted data; the code solely declares a namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace package setup. No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace(__name__)' to set up a namespace package. This is a common practice for Python packages that are designed to be part of a namespace, allowing multiple packages to share a common namespace. No input/output operations, no secret data, and no suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and typical for namespace declaration, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign namespace declaration for Python packages. There are no malicious behaviors, security issues, or anomalies detected.",
