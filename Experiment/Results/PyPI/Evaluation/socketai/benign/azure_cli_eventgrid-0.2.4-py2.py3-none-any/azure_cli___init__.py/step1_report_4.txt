  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, allowing multiple packages to share the same namespace.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls 'declare_namespace'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace declaration; no anomalies or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard module 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace, which is a common practice in Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network calls, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The code's simplicity and purpose are clear and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
