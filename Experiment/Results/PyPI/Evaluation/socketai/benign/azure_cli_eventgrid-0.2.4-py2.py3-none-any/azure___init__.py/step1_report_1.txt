  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package as part of a larger project, enabling modular packaging.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkg_resources' module, which reads system-installed package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code solely declares a namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of 'declare_namespace' is standard for namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace for the current package, a common practice for namespace packages in Python. There are no inputs, no untrusted data handling, and no suspicious operations. The code is minimal and appears legitimate and standard. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply declares a namespace for a Python package, which is a normal practice and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
