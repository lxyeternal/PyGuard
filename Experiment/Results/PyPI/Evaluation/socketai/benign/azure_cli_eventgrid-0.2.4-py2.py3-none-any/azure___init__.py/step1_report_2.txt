{
  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, likely part of a larger package structure.",
  "sources": "Importing 'pkg_resources' and calling 'declare_namespace(__name__)', which reads the current module's name and the 'pkg_resources' module.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code simply declares a namespace without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is minimal and standard for namespace declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares the current module as a namespace package. This is a common practice in Python packaging for modular distribution. No input reading beyond module import, no sensitive operations, and no external communication. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is typical setup code for a Python package and does not exhibit any suspicious behavior.",
