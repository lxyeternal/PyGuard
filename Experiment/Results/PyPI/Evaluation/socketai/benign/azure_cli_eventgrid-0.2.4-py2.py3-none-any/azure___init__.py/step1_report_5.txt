  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, facilitating modular package development.",
  "sources": "Import of pkg_resources module and declaration of namespace.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; static namespace declaration with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of declare_namespace is standard for namespace packages; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module from setuptools and declares a namespace for the current package, which is a common practice for Python namespace packages. There are no input sources, no data flows, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns. It does not perform any network operations, data manipulation, or security-sensitive actions. The license comments are standard and do not contain any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical namespace declaration in Python packaging, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
