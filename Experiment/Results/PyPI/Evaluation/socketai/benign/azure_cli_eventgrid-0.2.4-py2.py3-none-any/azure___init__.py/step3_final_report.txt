  "purpose": "Declare namespace in a Python package to enable modular distribution of namespace packages.",
  "sources": "Import of pkg_resources module and call to declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, external communications, or data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Import of pkg_resources → call to declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace using declare_namespace(__name__), a common pattern in Python namespace packages. There are no inputs, data flows, or external communications, and no suspicious or malicious constructs. The code is straightforward, with high confidence in its benign intent. No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign namespace declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify it as safe, and no further action is needed.",
