  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package's namespace declaration via pkg_resources.declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, the code only declares a namespace without data flow or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is minimal and typical for namespace declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace for the package. This is a common practice in Python package development to split packages across multiple distribution packages. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration for a Python package and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
