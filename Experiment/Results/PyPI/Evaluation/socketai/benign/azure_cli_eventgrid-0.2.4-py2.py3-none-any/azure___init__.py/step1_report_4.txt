{
  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package to facilitate plugin or extension mechanisms.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; uses only package metadata and namespace declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data output, network communication, or sensitive operation.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code simply declares a namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace packages, with no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace for the current package, which is a common practice for namespace packages. There are no data inputs, network calls, or file operations. It does not contain any obfuscated code or dynamic execution. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard package namespace declaration patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard namespace declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, minimal setup for a Python package namespace.",
