  "purpose": "This code provides CLI help documentation for managing Azure Event Grid resources via the Azure CLI, including topics, domains, subscriptions, and topic types.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings from the 'helps' dictionary and includes examples with command-line snippets and resource IDs; no dynamic input handling or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted or external data; all commands are documentation strings intended for CLI help purposes.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines static help documentation without executing logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. All code consists of static documentation definitions with example commands and resource IDs.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static help documentation for CLI commands related to Azure Event Grid management. It defines help text, command examples, parameters, and usage descriptions. There are no inputs, outputs, or executable logic that could be exploited. No suspicious or malicious code, code injection, or obfuscated code is present. The content appears standard for CLI help documentation, with resource IDs and command examples clearly indicating intended usage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign documentation data for Azure CLI help commands. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe help file configuration for user guidance.",
