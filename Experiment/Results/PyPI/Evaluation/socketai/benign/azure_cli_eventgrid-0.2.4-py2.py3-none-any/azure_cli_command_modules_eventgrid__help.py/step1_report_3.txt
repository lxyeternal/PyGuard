  "purpose": "Define CLI help documentation for managing Azure Event Grid resources, including topics, domains, subscriptions, and topic types.",
  "sources": "The code consists of string definitions assigned to 'helps' dictionary keys, providing descriptions and examples for CLI commands.",
  "sinks": "There are no code sinks that process or execute untrusted data; the code only provides static help documentation.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution paths are present; the code only stores descriptive strings for CLI help content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code contains only static help text with examples.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely documentation for CLI commands related to Azure Event Grid management. It does not contain executable logic, user input handling, or data processing. All strings are static, and the structure is straightforward. No suspicious code or malicious behavior is detected. The content appears consistent with standard CLI help documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of help text definitions for CLI commands managing Azure Event Grid resources. No malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks are identified.",
