  "purpose": "The code is static help documentation strings for Azure Event Grid CLI commands, providing command descriptions, examples, and parameter explanations without any executable logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "Help strings and command examples referencing resource IDs, command parameters, and static descriptions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle or process untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code is purely static documentation with no runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains only static help text with no secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string definitions for CLI help documentation, with no executable code, data handling, or network activity. The command examples are standard and reference resource IDs and parameters. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, consistent with the content. The detailed assessments correctly identify the benign nature of the code and do not overstate risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign static help documentation for Azure Event Grid CLI commands. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores should remain at zero across all categories, confirming its safety.",
