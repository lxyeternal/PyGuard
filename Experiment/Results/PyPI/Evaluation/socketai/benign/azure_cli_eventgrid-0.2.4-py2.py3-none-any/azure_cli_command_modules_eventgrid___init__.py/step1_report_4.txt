  "purpose": "Defines a command loader class for Azure EventGrid CLI commands and loads command tables and arguments.",
  "sources": "Imports from azure.cli.core, azure.cli.command_modules.eventgrid, and azure.cli.core.profiles",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or command execution in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mostly class and function definitions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules necessary for CLI command loading and defines a class that extends AzCommandsLoader. The class constructor sets up custom command types and resource types, then methods load command tables and arguments from other modules. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code strictly appears to set up command registration for Azure CLI modules, following standard patterns. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Azure CLI command loader for the EventGrid module. It performs expected setup and registration tasks without any malicious intent or suspicious activity. No security risks are identified.",
