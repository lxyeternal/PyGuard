{
  "purpose": "This code defines a command loader for the Azure CLI's EventGrid module, responsible for registering commands and parameters.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules from azure.cli.core and azure.cli.command_modules.eventgrid, which load external libraries and modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily sets up command registration functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code structure appears standard for command module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a command loader class for EventGrid, and sets up methods to load command tables and arguments. The class constructor initializes command types using Azure CLI core components. No external data processing or execution of dynamic code is present. No evidence of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. The code's purpose is standard for Azure CLI extension modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Azure CLI command loader implementation for the EventGrid module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
