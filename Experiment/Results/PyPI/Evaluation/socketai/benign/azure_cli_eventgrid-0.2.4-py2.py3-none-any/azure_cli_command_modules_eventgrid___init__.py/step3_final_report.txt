{
  "purpose": "This code defines an Azure CLI command loader class for the EventGrid module, facilitating registration of commands and parameters within the CLI framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from azure.cli.core, azure.cli.command_modules.eventgrid._help, and other command and parameter modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or data streams.",
  "flows": "Initialization of command type in constructor; loading command table and arguments via imported functions; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, standard, and lacks obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a boilerplate Azure CLI extension component, setting up command registration for EventGrid. It imports core modules, defines a loader class extending AzCommandsLoader, and loads command tables and parameters from other modules. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure behavior is evident. The code follows standard patterns, with no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, reflecting its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Azure CLI extension component with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are accurate and consistent with the static analysis.",
