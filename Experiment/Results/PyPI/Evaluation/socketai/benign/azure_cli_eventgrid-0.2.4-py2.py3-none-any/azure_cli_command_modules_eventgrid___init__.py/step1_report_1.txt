{
  "purpose": "Defines a command loader class for Azure EventGrid CLI commands, enabling the loading of command tables and parameters.",
  "sources": "Imports from azure.cli.core and related modules, including potentially untrusted command modules and parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted data; the code primarily sets up command structures.",
  "flows": "Imports from core modules flow into class initialization and method calls for loading commands and parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears to follow standard practices for CLI command loading.",
  "analysis": "The code imports core Azure CLI modules and specific command modules for event grid. It defines a class to load command tables and arguments, which is typical for CLI extensions. The class constructor sets up command types with templates and resource types, and methods load commands and arguments from designated modules. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated parts, or suspicious behavior. It solely facilitates command registration within the CLI framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for CLI command loading for Azure EventGrid, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as intended to extend CLI capabilities without exposing security vulnerabilities.",
