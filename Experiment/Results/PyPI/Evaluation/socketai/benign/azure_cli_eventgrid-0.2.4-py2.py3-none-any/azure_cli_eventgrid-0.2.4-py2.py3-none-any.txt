The main security concern is the acceptance of user-controlled endpoint URLs without thorough sanitization, which could be exploited if malicious inputs are provided. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk score should be increased for the scenario described in Report 5 to reflect this potential misuse. Scores in the existing reports are appropriate, with the exception of Report 5, which warrants a higher risk score due to input validation considerations."
