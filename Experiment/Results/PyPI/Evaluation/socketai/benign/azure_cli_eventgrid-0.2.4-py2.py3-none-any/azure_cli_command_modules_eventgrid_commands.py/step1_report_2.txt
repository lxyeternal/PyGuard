  "purpose": "Define command groups and operations for managing Azure Event Grid resources via CLI.",
  "sources": "Imports from azure.cli.core.commands, local module _client_factory, and string templates for operation functions.",
  "sinks": "Calls to operation functions such as get, list_shared_access_keys, regenerate_key, delete, create_or_update, update, list, and get operations for various Event Grid resources.",
  "flows": "User invokes CLI commands; command group functions call specified operation methods (e.g., get, list_shared_access_keys).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no unusual data leaks, or backdoors detected. Usage of string templates is standard for CLI command definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines CLI command groups and links them to appropriate operation functions and client factories for Azure Event Grid management. No data input/output flows indicate malicious activity. The command definitions are straightforward, with no obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a standard setup for CLI commands with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI command configuration for Azure Event Grid, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to register CLI commands to manage resources securely and efficiently.",
