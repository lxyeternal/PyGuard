  "purpose": "This code defines CLI argument configurations for managing Azure EventGrid resources, including domains, topics, and event subscriptions.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments, such as resource group names, resource IDs, endpoint URLs, and filter parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data like resource IDs, endpoint URLs, and subscription details; these are mainly for configuration and not directly malicious.",
  "flows": "User input is processed into argument objects, which are used to form API requests to Azure services; no direct data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions or external systems is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic were identified. The code strictly defines argument schemas without dynamic or reflective code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script strictly defines CLI arguments for Azure EventGrid resource management, including handling resource IDs, names, and filters. All arguments are used for configuration purposes with no dynamic code execution, input validation, or external data retrieval present in this code snippet. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The only notable aspects are the deprecation warnings and argument helpers which are standard practices. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI argument parser setup for Azure EventGrid resources, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this snippet.",
