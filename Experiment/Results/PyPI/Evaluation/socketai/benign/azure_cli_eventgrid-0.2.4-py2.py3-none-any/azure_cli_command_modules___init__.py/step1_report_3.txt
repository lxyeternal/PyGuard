  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package to allow for modular plugin architecture.",
  "sources": "Importing pkg_resources and calling declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present",
  "anomalies": "Use of declare_namespace for namespace package declaration; no suspicious behavior or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace for the current module, which is a standard practice for creating namespace packages in Python. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or execute untrusted code. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. The code is minimal and appears benign. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign implementation of namespace declaration using 'pkg_resources'. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
