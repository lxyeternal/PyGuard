  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package to support modular distribution",
  "sources": "The import of 'pkg_resources' and the call to 'declare_namespace(__name__)'",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or potential data leaks",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code simply declares a namespace",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'pkg_resources.declare_namespace' in a minimal context; no malicious or unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace' on the current module. This is a common pattern in namespace packages to enable multiple distributions to contribute to the same namespace. The code is minimal, standard, and does not contain any data input, output, or processing logic. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical namespace declaration for Python packages and shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
