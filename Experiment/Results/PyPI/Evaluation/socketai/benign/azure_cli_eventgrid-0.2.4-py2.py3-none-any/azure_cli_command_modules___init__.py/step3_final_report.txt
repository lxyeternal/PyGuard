  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "Importing pkg_resources module and calling declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import of pkg_resources → call to declare_namespace(__name__) with no data flow beyond namespace declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkg_resources module and declares a namespace using declare_namespace(__name__). This is a standard pattern for creating namespace packages in Python, enabling multiple packages to share a common namespace. The code is minimal, with no data flows, external communications, dynamic code execution, or hardcoded secrets. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its purpose and assign appropriate scores. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
