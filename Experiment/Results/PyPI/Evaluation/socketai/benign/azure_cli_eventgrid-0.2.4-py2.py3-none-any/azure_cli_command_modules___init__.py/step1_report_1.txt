  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for the package, allowing it to be extended across multiple distribution packages.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace using '__name__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; only namespace declaration occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. Use of 'declare_namespace' is standard for namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace(__name__)', which is a common pattern in Python namespace packages to facilitate modular distribution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code activities. No external data inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for namespace declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, benign snippet used to declare a namespace in a Python package. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
