  "purpose": "Declare namespace for the package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "Importing pkg_resources module, calling declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external effects observed",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; code only declares namespace",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkg_resources module and declares a namespace with __name__, a common pattern in Python packages for namespace packaging. There are no data inputs, no external communications, and no dynamic code execution. The purpose appears to be standard namespace declaration, which is a legitimate and common practice. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard namespace declaration using pkg_resources. It is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
