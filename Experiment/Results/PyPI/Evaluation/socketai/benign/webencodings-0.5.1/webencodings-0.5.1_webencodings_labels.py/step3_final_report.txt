  "purpose": "Static mapping of encoding labels to their canonical names for normalization purposes.",
  "sources": "The dictionary LABELS, which is a static, auto-generated data structure.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the dictionary is used as a static resource.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, auto-generated, and contains no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated dictionary mapping various encoding labels to standard encoding names. It contains no functions, input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The comments explicitly state it is auto-generated, which reduces suspicion. No signs of obfuscation, embedded secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The purpose is purely data normalization, and the structure is well-formed. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. There are no logical flaws or security concerns, and the code's static nature further confirms its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static resource for encoding label normalization. It poses no security risks or malware concerns, and the reports' assessments are accurate and consistent.",
