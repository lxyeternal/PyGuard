  "purpose": "Map encoding labels to their standard encoding names for use in encoding detection and normalization.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines a static dictionary called LABELS.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no functions or runtime data flows present.",
  "flows": "None; static data structure with no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward auto-generated dictionary with no suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated dictionary mapping various encoding label strings to standard encoding names. It includes no input/output operations, no runtime data processing, no external data sources, and no dynamic code execution. There are no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or network interactions. The content is purely a mapping table used for encoding normalization, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static data structure for encoding label normalization. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
