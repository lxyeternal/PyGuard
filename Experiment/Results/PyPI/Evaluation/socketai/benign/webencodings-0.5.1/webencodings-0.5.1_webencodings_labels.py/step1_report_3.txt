{
  "purpose": "Map encoding labels to their standardized names for use in encoding detection or conversion.",
  "sources": "The dictionary 'LABELS' is a static data structure, not reading external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; the code is purely static mapping.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is a static mapping structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code activities observed. The comment indicates the file is auto-generated; no dynamic or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static dictionary mapping various encoding labels to their canonical names. It is automatically generated, with no user input, network activity, or executable code. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. Usage of static data structures reduces risk of malicious flow. The file's purpose is straightforward, related to encoding label normalization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated static mapping of encoding labels. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The code is safe and intended for encoding normalization.",
