{
  "purpose": "This code maps encoding labels to their standardized names, serving as a lookup table for encoding normalization.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources or input reading points; the code defines a static dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points; the code is purely a static mapping.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static data only.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates the file is automatically generated by a script (mklabels.py). No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual code constructs are present. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a dictionary that maps various encoding label strings to standardized encoding names. The comments clarify that this file is auto-generated, and the data is static. There are no input/output operations, no network connections, or any code that could perform malicious actions. The purpose appears to be data normalization for encoding labels, which is common in text processing libraries. The code structure is straightforward and secure. No anomalies, such as embedded malicious payloads or backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign, static data mapping intended for encoding normalization. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
