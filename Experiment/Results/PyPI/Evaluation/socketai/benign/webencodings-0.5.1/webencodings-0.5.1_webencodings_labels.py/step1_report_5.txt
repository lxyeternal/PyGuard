{
  "purpose": "This code maps encoding labels to their standardized names, serving as a lookup dictionary for encoding normalization.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a hardcoded dictionary named LABELS.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "The code flow is static, with no runtime data flow or processing beyond loading the LABELS dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The file is automatically generated, as noted in comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated mapping dictionary without input handling, processing, or external communication. It is designed solely for encoding label normalization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The presence of a large static dictionary and comments about auto-generation do not indicate malicious intent but suggest routine, maintained code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static mapping dictionary for encoding labels with no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears to be part of a larger, standard library or module for encoding normalization.",
