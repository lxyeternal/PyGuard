{
  "purpose": "Map encoding labels to their standard names for use in encoding detection and processing.",
  "sources": "The labels dictionary is a static data structure; no input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing beyond static dictionary definition.",
  "anomalies": "The file is marked as auto-generated with a comment indicating it should not be edited. No signs of code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static dictionary mapping various encoding labels to their canonical names. There are no input/output operations, no external data handling, and no dynamic code execution. The file is clearly auto-generated, which reduces concern about malicious tampering. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or privacy-invasive functions are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a static mapping for encoding labels and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign, auto-generated resource file used for encoding label normalization.",
