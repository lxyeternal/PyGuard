  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the webencodings Python library, defining package metadata and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reading '__init__.py' for version, reading 'README.rst' for long description, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no execution or data transmission, no unsafe system calls.",
  "flows": "Extraction of version string from __init__.py; reading long description from README.rst; passing metadata to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of regex to parse version from source file is standard practice. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no suspicious imports or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script correctly reads version info from a source file using regex, reads a README file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata. All operations are standard for Python package setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The code's structure is typical for a setup.py script. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It performs typical package metadata extraction and setup procedures with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
