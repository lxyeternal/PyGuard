  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No untrusted data sources, external network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The regex used to extract the version is a common pattern, with no signs of obfuscation.\n- The code reads static files ('__init__.py' and 'README.rst') and passes data to 'setup()'—nothing suspicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The reported issues are **not** present in the code.\n- The code performs typical package setup operations without any anomalies.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound and aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports.\n- The regex extraction is standard; no issues there.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- All reports assign a **malware score of 0**, which is justified.\n- The **securityRisk score of 0** is correct.\n- The **obfuscated score of 0** is correct, as there's no obfuscation.\n- The **confidence scores of 1** are justified given the clarity and standard nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since there's no malicious activity, no external data flow, and no obfuscation, the risk remains minimal.\n- The highest risk score could be a false positive if the regex extraction method were insecure, but it's a common pattern and safe here.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious behavior or payloads detected.  \n- No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.  \n- The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, performing static file reads and metadata configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis.",
