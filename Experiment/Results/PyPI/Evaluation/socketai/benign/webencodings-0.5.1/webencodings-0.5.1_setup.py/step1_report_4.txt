  "purpose": "This code defines a setup configuration for a Python package called 'webencodings', including reading version information and long description from files.",
  "sources": [
    "Reading the '__init__.py' file in the 'webencodings' directory to extract version info",
    "Reading 'README.rst' file for long description",
    "Static assignment of package metadata"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "No untrusted input handling or data sinks identified",
    "No network operations, command executions, or data leaks present"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Read '__init__.py' to extract version (source)",
    "Use extracted version in setup() (sink)",
    "Read 'README.rst' for long description (source)",
    "Assign to setup() parameter (sink)"
  ],
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is a standard setup configuration script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static file reading to obtain package version and description information, then calls 'setup()' with package metadata. It uses regular expressions and file I/O in a safe manner, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
