  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Python setup script (`setup.py`) that reads version info from `webencodings/__init__.py` using regex, reads a README file, and calls `setup()` with package metadata.\n- No report mentions any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted user input.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n\n**Confirming issues:**\n- The code correctly reads the version string from the `__init__.py` file via regex. This is a common pattern, and no issues are present.\n- No suspicious behavior, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or external data injection, is evident.\n- The code performs only static file reading and package setup, with no external or untrusted data sinks.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n- The use of regex for version extraction is standard practice, though slightly brittle if the format changes, but this is not a security concern.\n\n**Scores and justifications:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity.\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected, raising scores would be unjustified.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all assessments are consistent with the code's straightforward nature.\n- No external dependencies or dynamic behaviors are involved that could introduce security risks.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a typical, well-structured setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores given in all reports are appropriate and should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent. No adjustments are necessary.",
