  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'webencodings' Python package, including version extraction and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the '__init__.py' file to extract the version; reading 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; the code primarily reads files and configures package setup.",
  "flows": "Extracts version info from '__init__.py' and uses it in setup; reads description from 'README.rst'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version info from a specific file using regex, and reads a README file for description. It then calls 'setup' with package metadata. All operations are standard for package setup scripts. No signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
