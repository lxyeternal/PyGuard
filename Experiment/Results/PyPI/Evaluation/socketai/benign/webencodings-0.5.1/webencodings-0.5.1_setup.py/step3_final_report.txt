{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for the 'webencodings' Python package, responsible for configuring package metadata and reading version information from the package's __init__.py file.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from 'webencodings/__init__.py' via regex; reads 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static file reads do not lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Version info extracted from '__init__.py' and passed to setup(); static description read and used in setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs standard package setup operations without obfuscation, malicious code, or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script that reads static files and metadata, then invokes setup() for package configuration. The regex used for version extraction is standard and safe in this context. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
