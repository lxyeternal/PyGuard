{
  "purpose": "Fetches encoding data from an external JSON resource and generates a Python module mapping labels to encoding names.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the URL 'http://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/encodings.json' via urlopen().",
  "sinks": "Processed data is used to generate Python code; no untrusted data is executed or stored locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from urlopen() reading the JSON, through parsing and processing, into code string assembly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly fetches JSON data at runtime, parses it, and formats it into a Python module. It does not contain malicious payloads, obfuscation, or secret data. Reliance on external data at runtime is a standard pattern but introduces a dependency that could be exploited if the source is compromised. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, performing a simple data transformation task. It does not include malicious code or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the external data dependency, which is typical for such auto-generation scripts. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the external dependency but no inherent threat.",
