  "conclusion": "The script is benign, performing a simple data transformation task. It does not include malicious code or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the external data dependency, which is typical for such auto-generation scripts. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the external dependency but no inherent threat."
