{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for encoding and decoding functions, verifying label lookups, error handling, and correctness across various encoding standards.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from static byte strings and function arguments within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data sinks; all data flows are confined within the test scope, with no network or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static test inputs through encoding/decoding functions and assertions, with no untrusted external data sources or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured test suite for encoding functions, involving label lookups, error handling, and correctness validation. It uses static data and assertions, with no external dependencies or network activity. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose is solely to verify encoding correctness, and it does not process untrusted external input or perform any suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a standard test suite for encoding functions, and the security assessment confirms it poses no threat.",
