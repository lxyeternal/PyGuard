{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for encoding and decoding functions related to character encodings, primarily to verify correct behavior and robustness.",
  "sources": "The code reads static test data, function parameters, and local variables. It does not accept external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code processes encoding and decoding functions but does not write to external systems, networks, or files. No sensitive data leakage points are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are confined within the test functions from input data to assertions, with no external untrusted sources influencing the flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code performs standard testing procedures with predictable data.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for character encoding functions, with no evidence of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. All functions operate on static, controlled test data. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present. The logic and data flow are standard for unit testing modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite aimed at verifying encoding functionalities. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. It poses no security threat.",
