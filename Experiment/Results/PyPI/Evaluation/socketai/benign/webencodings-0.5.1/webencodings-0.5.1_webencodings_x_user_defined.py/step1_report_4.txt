{
  "purpose": "Implement a custom text encoding 'x-user-defined' for encoding and decoding data streams.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, codecs module, and the defined decoding_table.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process untrusted input or output directly.",
  "flows": "The encode/decode methods process data through character maps; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The code is a standard implementation of a custom encoding.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom text encoding with associated classes for encoding, decoding, and stream handling. It uses a static decoding table with a mix of standard ASCII and high Unicode code points, but nothing suggests malicious intent. The encoding and decoding tables are pre-defined and static. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. The structure follows standard patterns for codecs in Python. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of a custom encoding scheme with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, benign module designed to support the 'x-user-defined' encoding.",
