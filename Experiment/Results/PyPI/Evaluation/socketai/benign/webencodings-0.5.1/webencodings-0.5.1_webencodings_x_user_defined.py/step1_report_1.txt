{
  "purpose": "Implement a custom 'x-user-defined' encoding for use in Python's codec framework, enabling encoding and decoding of data with a specific character mapping.",
  "sources": "The code defines static data structures: 'decoding_table' and 'encoding_table'. It does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or write data to external systems.",
  "flows": "The encoding and decoding functions operate solely on the static tables; there are no dynamic data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code strictly implements a character encoding table with standard API structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom character encoding in Python, utilizing static tables for encoding and decoding. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no external data inputs, and no suspicious logic. The presence of large static tables is typical for encoding definitions. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured encoding module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign implementation of a custom encoding codec for Python. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. The static tables are part of normal encoding definitions, and no suspicious activity is evident.",
