  "purpose": "Implementation of the 'x-user-defined' encoding for Python's codecs module.",
  "sources": "No external inputs or data sources; static encoding/decoding tables embedded in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that could leak untrusted data; purely encoding logic.",
  "flows": "Encoding and decoding functions transform data based on static tables; no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors; no obfuscated or unusual code structures. The encoding tables are extensive but standard for this encoding.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a character encoding 'x-user-defined' with associated encode/decode functions and static lookup tables. It relies on Python's codecs module to register the encoding. There is no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity. The large static tables are typical for character encoding implementations. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a character encoding in Python, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate and benign module defining a specific encoding.",
