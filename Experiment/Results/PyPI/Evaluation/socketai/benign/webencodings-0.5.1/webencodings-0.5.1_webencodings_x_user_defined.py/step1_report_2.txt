  "purpose": "Implementation of a custom text encoding 'x-user-defined' for encoding and decoding data streams.",
  "sources": "Reads input data in encode/decode methods via input parameters; uses predefined encoding and decoding tables.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable if untrusted data is encoded/decoded without validation, but no external outputs or system calls present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into encode/decode methods; processed through charmap_encode/decode using encoding_table and decoding_table.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Use of unusual Unicode code points appears to be for encoding purposes only.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom encoding 'x-user-defined' using a character mapping table, with standard codecs API implementation. No external network activity, file system access, or system modifications are present. The encoding table contains standard ASCII characters followed by a sequence of Unicode private use area code points, likely for encoding extension. No suspicious or malicious code behavior detected. The implementation appears to be a legitimate encoding scheme, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a custom character encoding for text processing. It appears to be a benign utility module without malicious intent or security risks. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is safe, straightforward, and standard for such encoding implementations.",
