  "purpose": "Implementation of a custom 'x-user-defined' encoding in Python using static character tables for encoding and decoding.",
  "sources": "Static decoding table containing ASCII and Unicode private use area characters.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or untrusted input handling; static tables used for encoding/decoding.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through the codecs API, mapped via static tables; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of Unicode private use area characters (U+F700–U+F7FF) in the decoding table, which are typical for custom encodings but could be misused if exploited.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Python codec for a custom encoding, using static tables for character mapping. It employs standard API classes without dynamic code execution, external data sources, or obfuscation. The inclusion of private Unicode code points is common in custom encoding schemes but could be misused if the encoding is exploited maliciously. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The implementation is clear, well-structured, and adheres to standard practices. The potential security concern is minimal and theoretical, related to the misuse of private Unicode characters, but this does not constitute malicious intent or activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of a custom Python encoding. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The static tables and use of standard APIs indicate a safe and standard approach. The presence of private Unicode code points is typical for such encodings and does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is negligible, and the implementation is safe for use.",
