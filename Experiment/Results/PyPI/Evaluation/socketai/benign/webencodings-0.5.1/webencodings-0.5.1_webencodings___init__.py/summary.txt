  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of encoding utilities with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by potential misuse of extension points but no actual threat. The reports are consistent and accurate."
