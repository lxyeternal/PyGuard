  "purpose": "Implementations of encoding standards and utilities for handling various character encodings, including UTF-8, UTF-16, and label lookup functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'label', 'input', 'fallback_encoding', 'encoding', and 'errors'.",
  "sinks": "Decoding and encoding functions (decode, encode, iter_decode, iter_encode), especially where untrusted data is processed and potentially transmitted or stored.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through decode/encode functions, with fallback mechanisms and BOM detection; label lookups from user input flow into codec lookups, with cache utilization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. The code handles input and encoding conversions transparently without executing external code or system commands. No unusual dynamic code execution or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of encoding handling aligned with the WHATWG encoding standard. It includes functions for label normalization, encoding lookups, BOM detection, and incremental encoding/decoding. Usage of codecs library for actual encoding/decoding is standard practice. The presence of cache for encoding objects improves efficiency. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code performs safe, well-understood operations related to text encoding conversions. All data flows are contained within the safe bounds of standard library calls and data processing routines. The only potential concern is processing untrusted input labels or data, but this is typical for such utilities, and proper use with validation is expected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of encoding utilities with no detected malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions as intended for encoding detection and conversion without performing any harmful actions. No malware or security risks are evident.",
