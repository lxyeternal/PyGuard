  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scoring consistency, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements encoding standards and utilities, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The analysis states the code is standard, with no backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the conclusion; no malware detected.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, considering the code handles untrusted input labels and data, but no direct security threats are identified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Comment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a typical encoding utility, and no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard implementation, no malicious behavior, and proper use of codecs and BOM detection.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no evident security issues.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n\n- **Comment:** The reasoning is appropriate. The code is a legitimate encoding library.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard character encoding library with no signs of malicious activity. The only noteworthy point is the conditional import of `from .x_user_defined import codec_info`, which is a standard extension point, not malicious.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, considering the potential for custom codecs, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n\n- **Comment:** The analysis is accurate; no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward implementation of encoding standards, with no signs of malicious activity. The use of external modules and standard library functions is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — minimal risk.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n\n- **Comment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with no malicious activity detected. The code performs standard encoding and decoding functions with BOM detection.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — slightly higher but still low, given the code's purpose.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n\n- **Comment:** The analysis is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, standard implementation.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly very low (0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the code's purpose as a utility library.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward and standard.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — very low, primarily due to handling untrusted input labels and potential for misuse, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate. The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of encoding utilities based on the WHATWG standard, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk scores are justified, and no changes are necessary.",
