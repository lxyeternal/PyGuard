  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of the WHATWG encoding standard, utilizing Python's 'codecs' module.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are present.\n- The code handles untrusted input through label normalization, BOM detection, and fallback mechanisms.\n- The only minor point is the conditional import of 'from .x_user_defined import codec_info' in the 'lookup' function, which is a legitimate extension point, not malicious.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution is evident.\n- The functions are designed for encoding and decoding, which are typical operations in text processing libraries.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2**\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer notes no suspicious behavior, with high confidence (0.9). The security risk is low, justified by the standard nature of the code.\n- **Verdict:** The score aligns with the analysis. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher confidence (0.95). The report emphasizes the standard, legitimate implementation with no malicious signs.\n- **Verdict:** The low risk score is appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious but still finds no malicious activity. The mention of the conditional import is standard.\n- **Verdict:** The risk score is reasonable. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0**\n- **Assessment:** Complete confidence (1.0). The review confirms the code's legitimacy.\n- **Verdict:** The risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk, but justified by the standard, straightforward implementation.\n- **Verdict:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varies between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero concern due to the conditional import and handling of untrusted input, which is standard in such libraries.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, considering the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and their scoring aligns with the code's nature. The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of encoding utilities with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The slight risk score reflects the handling of untrusted data and conditional imports, which are normal in such libraries.\n\n**No further action or score adjustments are necessary.**",
