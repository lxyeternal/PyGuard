{
  "purpose": "Implementation of the WHATWG Encoding standard for encoding and decoding text data, including lookup, BOM detection, and incremental encoding/decoding.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters such as 'input' for decoding and 'input' for encoding, as well as the LABELS dictionary for encoding label lookups.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs include decoded Unicode strings, encoded byte strings, and potentially data returned from codecs (though none are explicitly writing to external systems).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through decoding or encoding functions, with BOM detection influencing encoding choice, and lookups converting labels into codec info objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are evident. The code performs standard encoding operations, with dynamic lookup and BOM detection. No obfuscated or misleading code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard encoding/decoding functionality based on the WHATWG standard. It includes label normalization, lookup mechanisms, BOM detection, and incremental processing. It uses Python's standard codecs for actual encoding operations. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are present. The code's structure and functions align with legitimate text encoding libraries, and no anomalous or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of text encoding/decoding functions following the WHATWG specification. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware is identified. It functions solely as a standard library component with no evident security risks.",
