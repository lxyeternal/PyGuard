  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward version check for an Apache Airflow provider package.\n- The code imports `airflow.__version__`, compares it to a minimum version ('2.9.0'), and raises a RuntimeError if the installed version is too low.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden code is indicated.\n- The purpose is compatibility enforcement, a common and standard practice.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code's logic and operations are correctly described; it performs a version check based on trusted package data.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The version comparison is standard and safe, assuming `airflow.__version__` is from a trusted source.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the code or the report summaries.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions.\n\n### Scores and justifications:\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malware detected.\n- **Security risk score (0):** Correct, standard version check poses no security risk.\n- **Confidence scores (1 or 0.95):** Justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Potential points of critique:\n- The only minor point is that the reports emphasize the \"control flow based on untrusted data\" — technically, the version string comes from a package, which is trusted, but if `airflow.__version__` were compromised, it could potentially be manipulated. However, in practice, this is not a typical concern for such internal version checks, and the code is standard.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The code is benign, standard, and performs a necessary compatibility check.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, well-understood version check with no security issues.",
