  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the associated scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is straightforward: imports, version parsing, comparison, and potential RuntimeError.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- The only control flow is based on a version check, which is standard for compatibility enforcement.\n- The data source (`airflow.__version__`) is a trusted, internal package attribute.\n- The code is auto-generated, which is common for boilerplate version checks.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Compatibility check.\n- **Sources:** Reads `airflow.__version__`.\n- **Sinks:** Raises RuntimeError if version < 2.9.0.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent, straightforward version check.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `confidence: 1`\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, with similar reasoning.\n- **Scores:** Same as above, all zero for malware and obfuscation, confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Same purpose and logic.\n- **Scores:** Same as above, all zero, confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.95), but the reasoning remains the same.\n- No anomalies or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, confidence slightly below 1, which is reasonable given the straightforwardness.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Similar to others, with the same logic.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is present as described.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** None apparent.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0, appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\nGiven the detailed review, the code is a standard, auto-generated version check for an Apache Airflow provider package. It performs no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the actual code. No adjustments needed. The overall security assessment is that this code is safe and standard for version validation purposes.",
