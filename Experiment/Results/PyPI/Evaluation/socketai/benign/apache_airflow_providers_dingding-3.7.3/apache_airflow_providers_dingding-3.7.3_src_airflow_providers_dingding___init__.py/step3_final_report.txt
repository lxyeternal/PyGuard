  "purpose": "Enforce minimum required version of Apache Airflow for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads 'airflow.__version__' for version comparison.",
  "sinks": "Raises RuntimeError if the installed version is below 2.9.0.",
  "flows": "Version string from 'airflow.__version__' flows into version parsing and comparison, leading to potential exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version check with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'packaging.version' and 'airflow.__version__', defines a package version, and compares the current Airflow version to a minimum required version. If the environment's version is lower, it raises a RuntimeError. The logic is standard, trusted, and performs a simple compatibility check. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code relies on trusted package attributes and performs a benign control flow.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign version enforcement check with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, standard practice for package compatibility validation.",
