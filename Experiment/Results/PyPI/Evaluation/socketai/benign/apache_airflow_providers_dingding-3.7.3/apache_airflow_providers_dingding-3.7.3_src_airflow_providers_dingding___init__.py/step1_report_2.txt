{
  "purpose": "This code is used to define and verify the version of the apache-airflow-providers-dingding package, ensuring compatibility with the installed Apache Airflow version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current Airflow version from the imported airflow.__version__ and the package version defined as __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no operations that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves reading the Airflow version, parsing it, comparing it to a specified version ('2.9.0'), and raising an exception if the condition is not met.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward and consistent with version checking logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines a package version, and checks the installed Airflow version against a minimum required version. If the installed version is lower, it raises a RuntimeError with a message. The code is static, well-structured, and only performs version validation. No malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard version compatibility checks without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical version validation script for package compatibility.",
