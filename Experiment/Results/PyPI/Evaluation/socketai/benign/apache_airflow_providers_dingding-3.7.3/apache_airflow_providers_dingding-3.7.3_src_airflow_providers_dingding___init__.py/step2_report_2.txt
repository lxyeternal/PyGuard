  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code performs a straightforward version check and import operations.\n   - There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden activities.\n   - The code simply enforces a minimum version requirement for compatibility, which is standard practice.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note that the version comparison is based on a trusted package attribute (`airflow.__version__`).\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The only minor point is that some reports assign a confidence of 0.95 or 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is correct since no malicious activity is present.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the absence of obfuscation.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, which is justified.\n   - The overall assessment aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No issues warrant a higher risk score; the code is standard and safe.\n   - The version check is a common pattern, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on observable code behavior.\n   - The logic is sound and well-supported.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (standard version check, no security risk)\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The code is a typical, auto-generated compatibility check.\n- No hidden or malicious behavior is present.\n- The version enforcement is a standard and safe practice.\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, straightforward, and performs only a version validation, which is essential for compatibility but does not introduce security risks.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- No further action needed.",
