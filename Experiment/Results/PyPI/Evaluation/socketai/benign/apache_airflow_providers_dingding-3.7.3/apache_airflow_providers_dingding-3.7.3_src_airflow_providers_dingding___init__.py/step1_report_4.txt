  "purpose": "This code initializes version information for an Apache Airflow provider package and enforces a minimum version requirement for Airflow.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version from the imported `airflow.__version__` variable.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which is a control flow that terminates execution if condition is met.",
  "flows": "Source: reading `airflow.__version__` -> parsing version -> comparison -> sink: raising RuntimeError if condition is true.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code performs standard version checking and import operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and the current airflow version, defines package version, and performs a version check. If the current airflow version is below 2.9.0, it raises an error, preventing further execution. No input data from external sources is used other than the imported `airflow.__version__`, which is a standard and trusted data point. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard package version validation with no signs of malicious behavior. It enforces minimum dependency versions, which is a common practice for compatibility. No malware or security risks detected.",
