{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a package initialization or configuration script for an Apache Airflow provider, primarily to enforce version compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads the imported Airflow version (__version__ from airflow) and the package version (__version__ variable).",
  "sinks": "Raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which could halt execution, but this is a standard compatibility check.",
  "flows": "The code compares the airflow version with a minimum required version and raises an error if incompatible.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code detected. The version parsing and comparison are straightforward. The file includes licensing comments and boilerplate code, typical for auto-generated files.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and checks the current airflow version against a minimum requirement. It raises an error if the version is too low. No input data from external sources other than the imported module is processed. The purpose is to enforce compatibility, which is common practice in package setup scripts. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard version enforcement logic for a package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward compatibility check with no evidence of malware or obfuscation.",
