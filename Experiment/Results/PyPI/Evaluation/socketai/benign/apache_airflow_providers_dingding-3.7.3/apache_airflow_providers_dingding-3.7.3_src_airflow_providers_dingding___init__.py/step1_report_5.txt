{
  "purpose": "The code is a generated file for an Apache Airflow provider package, primarily performing version checks and module imports.",
  "sources": "airflow.__version__ (reading the installed Airflow package version), and the hardcoded __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "The RuntimeError that is raised if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0.",
  "flows": "The airflow.__version__ value flows into the version comparison logic, potentially leading to RuntimeError if conditions are met.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; the code performs straightforward version validation and module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads the installed Airflow version, and compares it against a minimum required version (2.9.0). If the installed version is older, it raises a RuntimeError with an informative message. All operations are standard and involve no external data inputs or dynamic code execution. The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, obfuscated parts, or malicious behaviors. The only potential concern is the version check, which is a standard practice for compatibility enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, auto-generated version validation script for an Apache Airflow provider package. It performs no malicious actions or security risks.",
