{
  "purpose": "This code defines version checks and imports for an Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring compatibility with the Airflow version.",
  "sources": "Reads the Airflow version from the imported `airflow.__version__` variable.",
  "sinks": "Raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which is a control flow based on untrusted data (though the data source is a package version).",
  "flows": "The code parses the Airflow version and compares it to a required minimum version. If the condition is met, it raises an error.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious activity. The version comparison and import statements are standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and checks the installed Airflow version against a minimum required version (2.9.0). It raises an error if the condition isn't met. The code is straightforward and primarily for compatibility enforcement. There is no indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior. No external network calls, no data leakage, and no suspicious obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for version checking and compatibility validation in a Python package. It does not contain malicious code or security risks. It performs version validation and imports without any suspicious activity.",
