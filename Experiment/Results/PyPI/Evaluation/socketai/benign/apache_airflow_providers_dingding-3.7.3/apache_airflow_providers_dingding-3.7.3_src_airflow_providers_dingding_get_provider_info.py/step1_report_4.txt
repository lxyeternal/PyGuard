  "purpose": "Provides metadata and configuration details for the Apache Airflow Dingding provider package, including versioning, integration info, operators, hooks, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The function get_provider_info() which returns a dictionary with static data. No external data input is processed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only returns static, predefined data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the data is hardcoded and static.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and generated, with no unusual code structures, dynamic execution, or obfuscated segments. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function returning a dictionary containing package info, versions, integrations, operators, hooks, connection types, and dependencies. All data is static and hardcoded, with no input processing, external data fetching, or dynamic code execution. The structure and content are consistent with auto-generated metadata, with no signs of malicious intent or anomalous behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static metadata provider for the Apache Airflow Dingding provider package. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, auto-generated configuration file.",
