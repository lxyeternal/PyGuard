  "purpose": "This code provides static metadata about the 'apache-airflow-providers-dingding' package, including version info, integrations, operators, hooks, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The function get_provider_info() returns hardcoded data; no external inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code is purely static.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the function simply returns static data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static function returning predefined package metadata with no external input handling, dynamic execution, or network activity. It is well-structured, clear, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The comments confirm its auto-generated nature. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static metadata provider with no malicious intent or security issues. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No modifications or further security concerns are necessary.",
