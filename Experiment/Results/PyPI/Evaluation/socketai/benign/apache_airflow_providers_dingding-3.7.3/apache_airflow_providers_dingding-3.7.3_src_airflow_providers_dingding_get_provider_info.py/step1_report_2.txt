  "purpose": "Provides metadata information about the 'apache-airflow-providers-dingding' package, including versions, integrations, operators, hooks, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The function get_provider_info() and the static data returned within it.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data influences external systems or outputs. No user input or network operations present.",
  "flows": "The function returns static data; there are no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward static function returning predefined metadata; no suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static Python function returning package metadata in a dictionary format. It contains no input handling, no external network calls, and no dynamic code execution. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic. The structure and content are typical for package metadata files. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard metadata function for a Python package, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
