  "purpose": "Provides metadata information about the 'apache-airflow-providers-dingding' package, including versions, integrations, operators, hooks, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The function get_provider_info() which returns a dictionary with static package info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only returns a static dictionary.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to sensitive actions; static data is returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed. The code is straightforward, auto-generated, and contains no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single function that returns a static dictionary containing package metadata. There are no external input reads, no data manipulation, and no suspicious behaviors. The file is clearly auto-generated, with no user input or external data sources. It includes only static data and no potentially dangerous code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, auto-generated metadata provider with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply supplies package info for the Apache Airflow Dingding provider module.",
