  "purpose": "This code is a license header comment providing licensing information and legal notices for the software.",
  "sources": "There are no data sources; the code contains only comments with licensing text.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows exist, as the code is purely a comment block.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow; the code is non-executable comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns are present; the code is standard licensing boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license header comment with no executable statements, data input/output, or logic. All reviews correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. Confidence is high due to the straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard license header comment with no executable or malicious content. The security assessment is accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
