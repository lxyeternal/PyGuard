  "purpose": "Implement cryptographic routines for NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 key derivation, signing, and sealing keys used in authentication protocols.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as negotiate_flags, session_base_key, server_challenge, challenge responses, lm_hash, and magic constants.",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic functions producing keys; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into cryptographic primitives (HMAC, MD5, DES) to produce exchange, sign, and seal keys based on protocol flags.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code is straightforward and protocol-compliant.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard NTLM cryptographic routines using well-known primitives. It handles different flags to derive keys for signing and sealing, following official specifications. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident, and the code does not perform external communication or contain obfuscation. The cryptographic operations are correctly applied, and the logic aligns with documented procedures. No errors or vulnerabilities are apparent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk~0.2) are consistent with the benign, protocol-compliant nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of NTLM key derivation functions with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
