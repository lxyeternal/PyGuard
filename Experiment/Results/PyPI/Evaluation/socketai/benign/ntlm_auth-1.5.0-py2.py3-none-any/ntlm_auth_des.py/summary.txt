  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard DES implementation with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is primarily due to ECB mode's cryptographic weaknesses, not malicious code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score should be around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting cryptographic limitations rather than malicious activity."
