{
  "purpose": "Implement a DES encryption/decryption cipher supporting ECB mode with key scheduling and block processing.",
  "sources": "Input data in 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods; key in constructor; data blocks in encode/decode methods.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted/decrypted output; no evident data leaks or external data transmission points.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through encryption/decryption methods, utilizing key scheduling, bit manipulations, and S-box substitutions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; standard DES implementation with explicit permutations and S-boxes. No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a classical DES implementation with detailed permutations, key schedule, and block processing. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, and no backdoors are present. The design aligns with standard cryptographic practices for DES. No signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads were identified. The code strictly focuses on cryptographic transformation, with transparent operations and no hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of the DES algorithm with no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It performs cryptographic functions as intended without any suspicious or malicious modifications.",
