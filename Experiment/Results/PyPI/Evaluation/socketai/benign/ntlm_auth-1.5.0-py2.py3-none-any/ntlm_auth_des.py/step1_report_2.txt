  "purpose": "Implementation of the DES encryption and decryption algorithm supporting ECB mode with key schedule and data processing functions.",
  "sources": "Input data: data to be encrypted/decrypted; key provided during class instantiation; internal static tables for permutation and substitution.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted or decrypted output; no direct data leaks or external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through key schedule generation, then through encode/decode blocks with permutations, substitutions, and final permutations, producing output data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code uses standard DES logic without obfuscation or malicious manipulations. No network or data exfiltration activities are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard DES encryption/decryption process with explicit permutation tables, key schedule generation, and data processing functions. It includes typical DES steps such as initial permutation, expansion, S-box substitution, permutation, and final permutation. It does not contain any suspicious network calls, file access, or hidden behaviors. No malicious code or sabotage indicators are present. The code appears to be a straightforward cryptographic implementation intended for secure data processing.",
  "conclusion": "This Python code provides a standard, transparent implementation of DES encryption/decryption without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations. No malware or malicious intent is detected.",
