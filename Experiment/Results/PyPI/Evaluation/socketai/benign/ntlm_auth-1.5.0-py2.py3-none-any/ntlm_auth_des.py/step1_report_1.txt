{
  "purpose": "Implementation of DES encryption and decryption algorithm supporting ECB mode with key scheduling.",
  "sources": "Input data for encryption/decryption (data parameter), key provided during object initialization.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly designed to send data outside; no network, file, or system commands present.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through _encode_block/_decode_block methods; key scheduling flows from constructor to _create_subkeys.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. No suspicious network activity or data leaks. The code is a standard DES implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard DES cipher with typical key scheduling, permutation tables, and block processing. No signs of obfuscation or hidden functions. It does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system tampering. All functions are standard for DES algorithms. No anomalies in control flow or data handling. The purpose appears solely for cryptographic use with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward DES implementation used for encryption/decryption, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions as expected for a cryptographic library.",
