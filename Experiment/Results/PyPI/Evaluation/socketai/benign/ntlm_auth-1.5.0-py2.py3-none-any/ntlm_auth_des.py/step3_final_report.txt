  "purpose": "Standard DES encryption/decryption implementation supporting ECB mode, with key scheduling and data processing functions.",
  "sources": "Input data blocks for encryption/decryption, key provided during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Processed output data; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through permutation, key expansion, S-box substitution, and permutation steps to produce encrypted/decrypted output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured implementation of the DES algorithm, including key schedule, S-boxes, and permutation tables. It performs standard cryptographic operations without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No external communication or hidden functionalities are present. The use of ECB mode is a cryptographic weakness but not malicious. The implementation aligns with typical DES standards, and no obfuscation or sabotage is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard DES implementation with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is primarily due to ECB mode's cryptographic weaknesses, not malicious code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score should be around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting cryptographic limitations rather than malicious activity.",
