  "purpose": "Implementation of DES symmetric encryption algorithm supporting ECB mode, for encrypting and decrypting data with an 8-byte key.",
  "sources": "The key provided during initialization; data input to encrypt/decrypt functions.",
  "sinks": "Output of encrypt/decrypt functions; no external data sinks or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through key scheduling, expansion, S-box substitution, permutation, and final permutation; data flows from input to output via these transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; standard DES implementation with no hidden or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard DES encryption/decryption with correct cryptographic steps, including key scheduling, block processing, and permutations. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network operations are present. No hardcoded secrets aside from the cryptographic key, which is standard. The class supports only ECB mode, which is known for security weaknesses but not malicious intent. The functions do not leak data outside their scope or contain anomalies indicating sabotage or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, standard implementation of DES encryption with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It correctly performs cryptographic transformations without any hidden functionalities. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
