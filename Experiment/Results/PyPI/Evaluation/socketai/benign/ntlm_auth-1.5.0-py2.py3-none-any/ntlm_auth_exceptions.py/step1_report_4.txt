  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for authentication context errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading points; class definition is static",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output points",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only defines an exception class",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; standard class definition",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a simple class declaration for an exception. It includes a docstring comment with license info, but no logic, input handling, or external data interaction. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign class definition with no malicious intent or security risks.",
