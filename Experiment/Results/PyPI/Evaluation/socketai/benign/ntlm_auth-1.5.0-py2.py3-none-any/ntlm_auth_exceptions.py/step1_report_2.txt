  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for authentication context errors",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code only defines a class and a comment",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output",
  "flows": "No data flow; no input or output operations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple class definition with a comment",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a class definition for NoAuthContextError, which inherits from Exception, and a comment with copyright and license information. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows. The class is a standard custom exception without any suspicious or malicious code. The license comment does not contain hidden instructions or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign class definition for a custom exception with licensing comments. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
