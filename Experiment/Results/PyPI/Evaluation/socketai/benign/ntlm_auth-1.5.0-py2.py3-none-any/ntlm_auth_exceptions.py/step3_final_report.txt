  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling authentication context errors.",
  "sources": "No data inputs or external data sources; the code is a class declaration with comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the class is a simple exception definition with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with licensing comments and a class declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class inheriting from Exception, serving as a custom error type. It contains only comments and a class definition, with no logic, data handling, or external interactions. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no malicious or security concerns. The reports accurately assess the code's benign nature, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
