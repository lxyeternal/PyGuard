  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - All reports describe a class named `NoAuthContextError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - The code is only a class definition with licensing comments; no logic, data handling, or external interactions are present.\n   - Confirmed: The code matches the description—it's a straightforward custom exception class with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent in their observations: all note the absence of data flow, logic, or malicious patterns.\n   - They uniformly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is justified.\n   - The code is a simple exception class with no operational logic or external data handling.\n   - No reason to escalate risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - The code contains no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n   - This is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they only describe the code as it is.\n   - No unwarranted claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct; code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct; no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, standard custom exception class with appropriate licensing comments. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concerns. The scores assigned are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The code is benign.\n- No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores:\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and safety profile.",
