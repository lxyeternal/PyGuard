  "sources": "The class definition and associated comments, no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows as the code only defines an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class definition for a custom exception named NoAuthContextError, inheriting from Exception, with a docstring comment indicating copyright and licensing. There are no data inputs, outputs, or complex logic. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class definition for a custom exception with no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies. It is a benign, standard pattern in Python for error handling.",
