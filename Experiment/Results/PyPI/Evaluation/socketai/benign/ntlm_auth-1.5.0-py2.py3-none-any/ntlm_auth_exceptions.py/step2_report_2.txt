  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports describe the code as a simple class definition for a custom exception (`NoAuthContextError`) with licensing comments. The code snippet provided confirms this: it contains only a class inheriting from `Exception` with no methods, data processing, or external interactions. There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious patterns present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no suspicious behavior. No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All are 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: All are 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Risk Score Analysis**:  \n   The reports assign a security risk of 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any operations, handle data, or interact with external systems. Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.1 would be unwarranted.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to the facts—it's just a class definition with licensing comments. No hidden behaviors or vulnerabilities are implied.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Report Content**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — no malicious behavior detected or implied.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score**: **0** — no security risk, vulnerabilities, or data handling.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code, I agree with the assessments and scores provided. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is a minimal, standard custom exception class with licensing comments.  \n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.  \n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n\n**Final recommendation**: Maintain the current scores and conclusions.",
