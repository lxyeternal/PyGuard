  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of a class definition for `NoAuthContextError`, inheriting from `Exception`, with associated comments and license info.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing logic.\n   - No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and straightforward, with no issues or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flow, external sources, sinks, or anomalies.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a class definition with no operational logic, no data flow, and no suspicious patterns, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The current `securityRisk` of 0 is justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0.\n   - The code contains no malicious instructions, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made, only about the nature of the class.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, harmless exception class with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n- No malicious or security concern exists in this snippet.",
