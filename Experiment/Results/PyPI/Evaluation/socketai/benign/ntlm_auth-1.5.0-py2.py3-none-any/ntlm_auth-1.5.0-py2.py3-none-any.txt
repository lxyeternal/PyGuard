The security risk is primarily due to ECB mode's cryptographic weaknesses, not malicious code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score should be around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting cryptographic limitations rather than malicious activity."

The security risk is low, but given the sensitive nature of cryptographic handling, a cautious approach warrants a slightly elevated risk score. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy."
