  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, standard implementation of NTLM challenge-response mechanisms. It does not exhibit any malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and cryptographic nature."
