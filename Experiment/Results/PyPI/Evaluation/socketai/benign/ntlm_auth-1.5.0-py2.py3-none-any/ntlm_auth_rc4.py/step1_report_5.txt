  "purpose": "Implementation of the RC4 stream cipher, either via the cryptography library or a Python fallback.",
  "sources": "Input keys for cipher initialization, input data for encryption/decryption in update methods.",
  "sinks": "Output of the update methods (encrypted/decrypted data). No external or untrusted data flows into other system components or network connections.",
  "flows": "Key input during object creation flows into cipher initialization. Data passed to update flows into encryption/decryption process, producing output data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code structures. The code performs standard RC4 stream cipher operations. Uses a fallback implementation if cryptography library is absent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an RC4 cipher implementation, with an option to use the cryptography library for performance. The fallback implementation uses a standard RC4 algorithm with key scheduling and pseudo-random generation. No network activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. No obfuscation or suspicious code features are present. The code appears to be a straightforward cryptographic utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements RC4 encryption/decryption in a typical manner, with a fallback option. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks beyond the inherent weaknesses of RC4, which is considered insecure for modern cryptography. No malicious intent or sabotage is evident.",
