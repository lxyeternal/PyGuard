  "purpose": "Implementation of ARC4 stream cipher encryption, either using the cryptography library or a custom Python implementation.",
  "sources": "Input data provided to the 'update' methods for encryption/decryption; key provided during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted output returned by 'update' methods; no external data sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into 'update' methods, where it is XORed with the pseudo-random stream generated by the cipher, producing encrypted/decrypted output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code implements standard RC4 cipher algorithms. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or covert channels are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes for RC4 encryption: one utilizing the cryptography library for performance, and a fallback Python implementation. The fallback involves standard RC4 key-scheduling (KSA) and pseudo-random generation (PRGA). It uses the 'struct' module for byte operations, which is typical. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious data handling. The design appears to be straightforward and intended for encryption purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard RC4 cipher with an optional dependency for performance. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this code segment. It appears safe and conventional for cryptographic operations.",
