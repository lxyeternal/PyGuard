{
  "purpose": "Implementation of ARC4 stream cipher encryption, optionally using the cryptography library for performance or a pure Python implementation as fallback.",
  "sources": "Key input during class initialization; data passed to update() method for encryption/decryption.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted data returned by update() method; no external output or data exfiltration mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "Input key -> class constructor -> cipher state setup -> data input to update() -> output encrypted/decrypted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code correctly implements ARC4 without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two implementations of the ARC4 cipher: one using the cryptography library for efficiency, and a fallback in pure Python. It properly handles key scheduling and stream generation, with standard practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden network activity. The code's structure and logic are straightforward, focusing solely on cryptographic functions. The only point of note is the optional use of external libraries, which is a common practice and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard ARC4 cipher with fallback options and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate cryptographic utility with no indicators of malware or malicious intent.",
