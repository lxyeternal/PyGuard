  "purpose": "Implements RC4 (ARC4) stream cipher encryption with optional cryptography library support, providing a fallback Python implementation.",
  "sources": "Input data provided to the update() method for encryption/decryption; key supplied during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Output of the update() method, which produces encrypted or decrypted bytes.",
  "flows": "Key initialization during __init__, then data flows through update() where it is XORed with pseudo-random stream generated by _random_generator().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, standard implementation of RC4 with no suspicious features or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard RC4 cipher with a fallback Python version and optional cryptography library usage. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, network activity, or backdoors. The implementation follows typical RC4 procedures: key scheduling and pseudo-random byte generation. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The use of RC4 is cryptographically insecure for modern standards, but this is a known cryptographic weakness, not malicious code. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting RC4's cryptographic vulnerabilities but not malicious intent. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9+).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of RC4 encryption with no signs of malicious activity or backdoors. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The security risk score appropriately reflects RC4's cryptographic weaknesses, not malicious behavior.",
