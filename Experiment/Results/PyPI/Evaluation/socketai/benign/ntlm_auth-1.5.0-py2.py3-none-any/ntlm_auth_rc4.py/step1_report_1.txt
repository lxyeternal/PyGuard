  "purpose": "Implement ARC4 stream cipher encryption/decryption using either the cryptography library or a pure Python implementation as a fallback.",
  "sources": "Input data for the 'update' methods of the ARC4 classes, key parameter during class initialization.",
  "sinks": "Output of the 'update' methods, which produce encrypted/decrypted data.",
  "flows": "Input data → update method → pseudo-random or cryptography library cipher → output data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code features. The code performs standard ARC4 encryption/decryption with both library and fallback implementations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes implementing the ARC4 stream cipher: one using the cryptography library (if available) and a fallback pure Python implementation. The implementation appears standard and well-structured for cryptographic operations. The fallback uses a known RC4-like algorithm with key scheduling and pseudo-random generation, consistent with typical RC4 implementation. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden functionalities. The code does not contain suspicious or obfuscated elements, nor does it perform any unusual operations beyond standard cryptography routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides a standard implementation of the ARC4 cipher with a fallback option. It appears to be a legitimate cryptographic utility with no malicious intent. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious anomalies were identified.",
