  "purpose": "Implementations of ARC4 stream cipher encryption, either using the cryptography library or a custom Python implementation.",
  "sources": "Constructor methods initializing cipher states with provided keys.",
  "sinks": "The 'update' methods output encrypted data, potentially exposing encrypted output but not directly untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Input data to 'update' functions, which produce encrypted output using internal cipher state and key.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; code uses standard cryptographic libraries or standard pseudo-random algorithms. No unusual code patterns or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes for ARC4 encryption: one leveraging the cryptography library for efficiency and security, and a fallback pure Python implementation. The cryptography-based class properly initializes an ARC4 cipher and provides an 'update' method for encryption. The fallback class implements the RC4 key scheduling algorithm and pseudo-random generation in Python. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection are present. The code appears to be a standard cryptographic utility for encrypting data, with no signs of malicious intent or covert operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides standard ARC4 cipher implementations, one secure (via cryptography library), one in pure Python, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign cryptographic utility intended for encrypting data.",
