{
  "purpose": "Implement NTLM hash functions: LM hash (_lmowfv1), NT hash (_ntowfv1), and NTLMv2 hash (_ntowfv2), for authentication purposes.",
  "sources": "Input password string, user_name, domain_name, and pre-hashed password strings validated via regex.",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic hash computations using hashlib, hmac, and DES; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Password input (or pre-hash string) -> hash functions (_lmowfv1, _ntowfv1, _ntowfv2) -> output hashes.",
  "anomalies": "Accepts pre-hashed passwords via regex matching, which is standard but could be misused if inputs are untrusted; no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cryptographic procedures for NTLM hashing, correctly handling pre-hashed inputs, and uses well-established libraries. No network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation are present. The regex validation for pre-hashed inputs is typical in such functions. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. The code's structure is straightforward and readable. The security risk score is low, justified by the acceptance of pre-hashed inputs, which is standard in authentication workflows but could be misused if inputs are untrusted. The malware score is zero, indicating no malicious intent. The obfuscation score is zero, as the code is clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of NTLM hash functions used in authentication protocols. It handles inputs securely, employs standard cryptographic libraries, and contains no malicious or suspicious behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
