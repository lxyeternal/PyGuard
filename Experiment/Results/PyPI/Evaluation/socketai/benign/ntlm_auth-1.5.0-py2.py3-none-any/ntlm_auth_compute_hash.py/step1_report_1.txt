{
  "purpose": "This code implements functions to generate NTLM hashes used for authentication, including LM and NT hash calculations, as well as NTLMv2 hashing for user credentials.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from parameters such as password, user_name, and domain_name. It also performs regex checks on passwords to identify pre-hashed inputs.",
  "sinks": "Hash computations and HMAC generation are performed using standard libraries, with no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (password, user_name, domain_name) flows into hash functions and regex checks, leading to hash outputs; no external data or untrusted data flows outside hash computations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code relies on standard cryptographic functions and proper regex validation. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The functions provide cryptographic hashing for authentication protocols, specifically NTLM. They correctly handle pre-hashed passwords, use appropriate hash functions, and implement standard procedures for hash derivation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious external connections are evident. The code is focused solely on hash calculations for authentication purposes. The use of regex to detect pre-hashed passwords is standard, and the cryptographic operations use well-known libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate implementation of NTLM hash functions with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs standard cryptographic operations as intended for authentication purposes. No security risks or malware behaviors are detected based on this analysis.",
