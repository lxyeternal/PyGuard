{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for generating NTLM hash values used in authentication protocols (NTLMv1 and NTLMv2).",
  "sources": "User input is taken via the 'password', 'user_name', and 'domain_name' parameters. Password can also be a precomputed hash provided as a hex string.",
  "sinks": "Hash computations, regex checks for hash format, and DES encryption functions are performed; no direct data leakage or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed to produce hash values. If the password is in hash format, it is directly decoded; otherwise, it is hashed or encrypted. No external data flows outside these transformations.",
  "anomalies": "The code accepts pre-hashed passwords as input, which could be used maliciously if misused, but this is standard for hash operations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected. No network calls or system modifications. The DES module's internal implementation isn't shown, but usage appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The functions implement standard NTLM hashing algorithms: LM hash, NT hash, and NTLMv2 hash. They perform regex validation for hash inputs, encode passwords, and perform encryption or hashing as per specifications. No obfuscated code, suspicious API calls, or hidden behaviors are present. The code does not contain network operations, file I/O, or system modifications. It appears to be a legitimate implementation of hashing algorithms for authentication.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of NTLM hash functions used for authentication. No malicious behavior or sabotage evident. The acceptance of pre-hashed input is typical for such functions, not inherently malicious. Overall, the code is consistent with expected security practices for hashing functions.",
