{
  "purpose": "The code implements functions for generating NTLM hashes used in NTLM authentication protocols, specifically for Windows authentication mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'password', 'user_name', and 'domain_name' parameters; reads input password hashes from hex strings",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptographic functions (hashlib, hmac, DES encryption) to produce hashes; no direct data leaks or network transmissions present in the code",
  "flows": "Password or hash inputs -> hash calculations or DES encryptions -> return hashes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; standard cryptographic procedures. Functions handle inputs securely without unsafe operations. The code correctly distinguishes between plain passwords and precomputed hashes.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions for computing LM and NT hashes for authentication, including handling precomputed hash strings. The logic follows standard cryptographic procedures for Windows NTLM authentication. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; no backdoors, covert channels, or system manipulations are present. The code strictly handles hashing operations without network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms. It appears to be a legitimate implementation of NTLM hash functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of NTLM hashing functions with no indications of malicious intent or supply chain attacks. It performs cryptographic operations securely and correctly for its purpose. No malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
