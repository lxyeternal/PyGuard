  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of NTLM authentication routines. No malicious or obfuscated code is detected. The security risk is low, but given the sensitive nature of cryptographic handling, a cautious approach warrants a slightly elevated risk score. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy."
