  "purpose": "Implementation of NTLM message structures, cryptographic response generation, and session key creation for authentication protocols.",
  "sources": "Input challenge messages, user credentials, system data, and cryptographic functions such as os.urandom, hmac, hashlib.",
  "sinks": "Message serialization, cryptographic responses, session key storage, and message transmission data.",
  "flows": "Input challenge data and user credentials flow into cryptographic response calculations, which then flow into message assembly and transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious external connections, or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standards-compliant implementation of NTLM message handling, including cryptographic operations, message formatting, and secure random key generation. All cryptographic practices are appropriate, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The use of os.urandom for session keys and standard libraries indicates adherence to best practices. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of NTLM protocol message handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is negligible. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified.",
