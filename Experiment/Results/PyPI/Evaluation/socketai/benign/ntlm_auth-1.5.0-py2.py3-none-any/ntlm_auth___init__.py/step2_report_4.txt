  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple module initializer that imports local modules 'ntlm' and 'session_security' and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are identified.\n- The license comments are standard and do not indicate any malicious intent.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n1. **Code presence and correctness:**\n   - The code matches the original code snippet provided.\n   - The import statements and `__all__` declaration are correct.\n   - No anomalies or deviations are observed.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and benign.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or 0.5, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Since the code is purely for module export with no malicious or risky behavior, these scores are appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1 or 1.0), which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - No justification is needed for higher scores because the code shows no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports assign malware score as 0, which is correct.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and accurate, avoiding assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the provided assessments. The code is a simple, benign module initializer.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.           |\n| Security Risk      | 0       | No vulnerabilities or risky operations identified.         |\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code is a standard module export pattern with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
