{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up module imports and defining exportable components, likely for a larger package related to NTLM authentication and session security.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current module's submodules 'ntlm' and 'session_security'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs import and export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected. The license comment is standard and there are no dynamic or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements and an '__all__' declaration to specify public interface. It does not include any data processing, user input handling, or network activity. The license comment indicates authorship and licensing but no malicious intent. No unusual code patterns or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward module initializer for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
