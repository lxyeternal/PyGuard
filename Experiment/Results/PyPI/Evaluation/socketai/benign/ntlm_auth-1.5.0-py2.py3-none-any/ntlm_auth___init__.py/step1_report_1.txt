{
  "purpose": "Export modules 'ntlm' and 'session_security' for external use, likely related to authentication/security features.",
  "sources": "Import statement for local modules 'ntlm' and 'session_security'. No external data input observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code only performs imports and exports symbols.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; no runtime data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or unusual code structures present. The code appears to be a standard module initialization file.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a module-level comment with license info, two import statements for local modules, and an __all__ declaration to specify exported symbols. There is no evidence of data input, processing, or network communication. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module initializer with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply exposes certain modules for external use.",
