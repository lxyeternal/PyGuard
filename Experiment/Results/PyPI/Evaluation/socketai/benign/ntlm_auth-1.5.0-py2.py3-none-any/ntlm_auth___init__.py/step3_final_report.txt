{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer that imports internal modules 'ntlm' and 'session_security' and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports internal modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup with import statements and an __all__ declaration. It contains no data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The code is well-structured, standard for Python packages, and contains no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are justified. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
