{
  "purpose": "Export modules 'ntlm' and 'session_security' for external use, likely as part of a security/authentication library.",
  "sources": "Imports 'ntlm' and 'session_security' modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; code only performs module re-exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only exports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is simple, well-structured, and includes licensing information.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules 'ntlm' and 'session_security' and exposes them via __all__, indicating intended module exports. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or suspicious constructs. The presence of licensing comments and module export statements is standard practice for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module re-export with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a security/authentication library.",
