  "purpose": "Define and expose 'ntlm' and 'session_security' modules for external use",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules 'ntlm' and 'session_security'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external input or untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "Presence of module imports without further code; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of metadata comments and import statements. It imports two local modules and exposes them via __all__. There are no data input/output operations, no code execution, and no suspicious constructs. The comments indicate authorship and licensing, typical for open-source modules. No malicious or security-sensitive behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module definition with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply re-exports internal modules, which is standard practice.",
