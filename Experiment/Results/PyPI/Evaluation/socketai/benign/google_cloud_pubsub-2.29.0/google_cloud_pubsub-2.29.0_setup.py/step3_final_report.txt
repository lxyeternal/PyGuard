  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the google-cloud-pubsub Python library, configuring metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'google/pubsub/gapic_version.py' via exec(), reads README file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network activity; no data leaks or malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "exec(fp.read(), version) executes version file; dependencies and metadata are processed for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info, which could be risky if the version file is maliciously altered.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with standard practices. The only dynamic element is executing an external version file, which is common but could pose security concerns if the file is compromised. No network activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the context. The pattern is widely used in packaging but relies on the integrity of the version file.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard package setup with no malicious intent. The use of exec() on a trusted version file is a minor concern but not indicative of malicious behavior. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for production use.",
