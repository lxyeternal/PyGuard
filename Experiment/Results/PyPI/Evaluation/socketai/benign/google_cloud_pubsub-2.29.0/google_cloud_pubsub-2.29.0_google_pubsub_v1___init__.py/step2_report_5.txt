  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is an SDK module that imports various clients and types, with no dynamic or untrusted data handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows are present; the code is static.\n- **Anomalies:** The only anomaly is the future copyright date (2025). This is likely a placeholder or a typo, not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard SDK boilerplate with no malicious activity. No signs of malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 seem reasonable given the anomaly but not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the import/export structure, no data flows, and standard licensing.\n- **Anomalies:** Same as above—future date, likely a placeholder.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the same points: static imports, no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious elements.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, a straightforward SDK module with no dynamic behavior or malicious indicators.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 are justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion: standard SDK setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None. All reports correctly identify that this is a static SDK module with no dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Risk scores:** Should be very low, given the absence of any suspicious or malicious activity.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0, possibly 0.1 at most, due to the anomalous future date which is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is a standard SDK module setup with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The only anomaly is the future copyright date, which does not impact security.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the unusual date, but not a security concern)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
