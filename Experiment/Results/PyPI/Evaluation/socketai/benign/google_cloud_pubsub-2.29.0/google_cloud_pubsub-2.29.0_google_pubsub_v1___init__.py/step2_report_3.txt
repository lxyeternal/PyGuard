  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code is mainly importing classes and types, with no active data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes the future copyright date (2025). This is suspicious but not malicious; it could be placeholder or a typo.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately concludes the code is standard SDK boilerplate with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware score at 0, security risk at 0.1—reasonable given the anomaly but no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The future date is unusual but not malicious. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the module as an SDK interface setup.\n- **Anomalies:** Same as above—future date, but no malicious implication.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid, recognizes that the code is a straightforward package interface with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, security risk at 0—appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Well justified. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes import/export nature.\n- **Anomalies:** Same note on the future date, but no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies this as a benign SDK component.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0—appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly assessed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the module's role.\n- **Anomalies:** Same note on the future date; no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states this is a standard SDK setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0—appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** Same as above; no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as a typical SDK module.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0—appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static, primarily import/export setup for an SDK.\n- The only anomaly is the future copyright date (2025), which is suspicious but not malicious.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscated code, or malicious intent are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware 0, security risk ~0.1) are reasonable given the anomaly.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated segments.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n- Clear, straightforward import/export code with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.1**  \n- Slightly elevated due to the future date, but not a security concern.\n\n**Additional Notes:**  \n- The future date could be a placeholder or a typo, but it does not introduce security risks.\n- The code is typical SDK boilerplate, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor anomaly (future date) does not impact security. The current scores are appropriate, but if I were to suggest a slight adjustment, I would set all scores to zero, emphasizing the benign nature.\n\n**Recommended final scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or 0 if considering the anomaly insignificant)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The supply chain risk for this code is minimal; it is standard SDK setup code with no malicious intent.",
