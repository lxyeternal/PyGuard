{
  "purpose": "This code module imports classes and types from the Google Pub/Sub SDK and internal modules, then exposes them via __all__ for external use. It functions as a setup or interface layer for the SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from static import statements of SDK classes, types, and internal modules; no external data sources or user input are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data handling; the code only defines exports and imports without processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and only establishes module interfaces.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the copyright year '2025', which is in the future and likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK setup module that imports various classes and types from the Google Pub/Sub SDK and internal modules, then exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright date, which does not impact security. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, boilerplate SDK interface module with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright date, which is likely a placeholder. The code poses no security risks.",
