  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a module that imports classes and types from Google Pub/Sub SDK and local modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of data being sent to external sinks or untrusted sources; mainly static imports.\n- **Anomalies:** The only anomaly is the future-dated copyright (2025). This is likely placeholder or a typo, not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is boilerplate SDK setup, with no dynamic code, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low, justified by the anomaly but not malicious).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the standard nature of the code—imports, exports, no dynamic logic.\n- The future date again appears, but no malicious intent is implied.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0, consistent with a benign SDK module.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, describes a typical SDK setup with no suspicious activity.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0, aligned with a safe library.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: import/export of SDK classes, no runtime logic.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, a standard SDK module with no dynamic code or malicious patterns.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe the same type of code—an SDK module setup with imports and exports. No code execution, no network activity, no data handling, no obfuscation, no embedded secrets.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All scores are zero, which is appropriate given the static, boilerplate nature of the code.\n- **Anomalies:** The only anomaly is the future copyright date (2025). This is likely a placeholder or a typo, not malicious.\n- **Supply Chain Risks:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious dependencies. The code appears to be a legitimate part of an SDK package.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, standard, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks evident.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThis code is a standard SDK module setup, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only notable anomaly is the future copyright date, which is not suspicious.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
