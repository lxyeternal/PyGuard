  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard license and version declaration for a Python module, likely part of a larger project.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the embedded version string '__version__' and the license comments; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there is no data processing, I/O, or external communication.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code is purely declarative and informational.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs are present. The license comments are standard, and the version string is static.",
  "analysis": "The code contains license comments, copyright statement, and a version string assignment. It is purely metadata with no executable or malicious components. No input, no data processing, and no potential for security issues or malicious behavior are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as licensing and version metadata for a Python package. No malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
