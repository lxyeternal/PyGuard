  "purpose": "This code serves as a license header and version identifier for an open-source Python package, providing metadata about licensing and versioning.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only contains comments and a static version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code contains only static comments and a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, consisting solely of comments and a version string, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard license and version header with no executable logic, network calls, or data processing. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as metadata for licensing and versioning. All assessments and scores are justified, and no changes are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
