  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured async gRPC transport layer for schema management, with no malicious intent or sabotage. The primary security consideration is verbose logging of potentially sensitive data, which should be managed securely in production environments. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2 due to logging concerns."
