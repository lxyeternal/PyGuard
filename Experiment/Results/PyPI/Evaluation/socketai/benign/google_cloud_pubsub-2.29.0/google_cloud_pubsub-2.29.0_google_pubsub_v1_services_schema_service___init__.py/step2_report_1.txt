  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements and an `__all__` declaration.\n- No data processing, network communication, or external input handling is present.\n- The license comment is standard, except for a future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder.\n- No obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code's purpose is to export client classes for a schema service, typical in SDKs or API client libraries.\n- The source code imports are from local modules (`.client` and `.async_client`), which is standard.\n- No external data sinks or flows are present.\n- The future-dated copyright (2025) is unusual but not malicious.\n- The reports' confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and the malware and security risk scores are 0, aligning with the benign assessment.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the lack of any security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which might be a typo or placeholder, but it does not impact security.\n- No claims or assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- Based on the code snippet and reports, the package appears to be a standard, benign module for exporting client classes.\n- No changes are necessary for the scores; they are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward module with no security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified. The only minor note is the future copyright year, which is likely a placeholder or typo, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nAccept the current assessments; no further action needed.",
