{
  "purpose": "Defines and exports schema service client classes for API interaction.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .async_client). No input data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output mechanisms; code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; code is purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future, but this is likely a placeholder or typo. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code features.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of license comments, import statements, and an __all__ declaration. No user input, environment variable use, or network operations. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns. The license comment, though future-dated, does not impact security analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module defining and exporting client classes. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, and no security risks are identified based on this content.",
