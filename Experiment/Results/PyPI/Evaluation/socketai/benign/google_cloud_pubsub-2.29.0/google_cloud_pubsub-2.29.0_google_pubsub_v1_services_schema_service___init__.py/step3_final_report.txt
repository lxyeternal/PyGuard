  "purpose": "Export client classes for schema service API, serving as a module interface.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client and .async_client).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no data flow or runtime data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025) is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, with standard license comments. No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing is present. The only anomaly is the future date, which is likely a typo or placeholder. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for exporting client classes, with no malicious or security issues. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
