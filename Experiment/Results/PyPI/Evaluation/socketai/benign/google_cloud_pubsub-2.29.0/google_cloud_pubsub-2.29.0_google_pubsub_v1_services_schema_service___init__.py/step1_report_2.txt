{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that exports client classes related to a schema service, likely part of an SDK or API client library.",
  "sources": "The source code imports from local modules: '.client' and '.async_client'. It does not take input from external sources or user input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks are present; there are no operations that output or transmit data to external systems.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines and exports classes without executing runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a copyright statement from 2025, which is a future date and unusual, but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module that imports two classes from local modules and defines an __all__ list for exports. It contains no logic, no data processing, and no network operations. The presence of future copyright date is likely a typo or placeholder but does not indicate malicious intent. The structure and syntax are typical for Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module file used for exporting classes. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code is straightforward and adheres to common practices.",
