{
  "purpose": "Define and register transport classes for a schema service API, facilitating different communication methods (gRPC, REST, etc.).",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library, relative imports of transport classes, and the creation of a transport registry.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data or inputs are processed or outputted insecurely.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; the code only registers classes in a dictionary without processing external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and appears to be boilerplate for a service client library.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary transport classes and registers them in an ordered dictionary for later use. There are no user inputs, environment variable usages, or network operations. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The license comments and structure are consistent with open-source client library patterns. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard component for a client library, registering transport options for a service. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
