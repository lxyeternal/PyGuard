  "purpose": "Register transport classes for schema service API and related protocols.",
  "sources": "Import statements for classes and the creation of an ordered dictionary for registration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import classes -> register in _transport_registry -> export via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup for registering transport classes in an SDK, involving static imports and registration in an ordered dict. No dynamic code execution, input processing, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The purpose is configuration, not execution of malicious logic. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign SDK setup module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
