{
  "purpose": "The code defines and registers transport classes for a schema service API, supporting gRPC, async gRPC, and REST transports, as well as related interceptors.",
  "sources": "Import statements, dictionary key-value assignments, and module exports",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs present",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks identified",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; standard licensing comments and imports",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and classes, creates an ordered dictionary to register transport classes, and exposes these classes via __all__. There are no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or external data handling. The license comments are standard and the structure appears typical for a Python package component.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate part of a package infrastructure setup for a schema service, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
