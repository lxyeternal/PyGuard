  "purpose": "Define and register transport classes for a schema service API, supporting gRPC and REST protocols.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (collections, typing) and relative module imports (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest). No input reading detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Import statements and registration of transport classes into an ordered dictionary; no data flow involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be standard transport registration logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and specific transport classes from relative modules. It creates an ordered dictionary to register different transport implementations for a schema service. The code is well-structured, with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious patterns. The license header and imports suggest it is part of a larger, professionally maintained package. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a straightforward registry setup for transport classes. It shows no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. The overall security risk is very low.",
