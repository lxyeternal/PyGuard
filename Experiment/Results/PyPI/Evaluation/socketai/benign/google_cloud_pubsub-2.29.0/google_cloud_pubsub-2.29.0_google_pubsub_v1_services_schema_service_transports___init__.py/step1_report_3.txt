{
  "purpose": "Defines and registers various transport classes for a schema service API, including gRPC, asyncio, and REST transports.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (collections, typing) and local modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest). No external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs; code only sets up class references and an ordered dictionary.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code merely registers class types in a registry without handling external or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code appears standard for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines a registry for transport classes, and populates it with class references. No dynamic code execution, no user input processing, and no network interactions. No signs of malicious intent or security issues. The code functions as a straightforward registry setup for transport mechanisms in a client library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup module for registering transport classes in a Python SDK. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard boilerplate code for SDK transport registration.",
