{
  "purpose": "Defines transport classes and registers them for a schema service client, facilitating different communication protocols.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes, including the base transport and protocol-specific transports; the dictionary registration of transports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code primarily sets up class references and a registry.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only initializes class references and an ordered dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The license and import statements are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines a registry for different transport classes, and populates it with class references. No input handling, network operations, or execution of dynamic code is present. The license and import statements are benign and standard for open-source projects. There are no anomalies indicating malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward registry setup for transport classes used in a client library. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
