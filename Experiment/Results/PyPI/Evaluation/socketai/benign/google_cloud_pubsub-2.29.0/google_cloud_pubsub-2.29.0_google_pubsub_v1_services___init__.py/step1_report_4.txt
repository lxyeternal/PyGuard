  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow present in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future relative to the typical current date, possibly indicating placeholder or intentionally altered metadata. No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of comments containing licensing information and a copyright notice. There are no executable statements, no data handling, input reading, or any code logic. The code structure is standard for open-source licensing headers and does not present any security concerns or malicious intent. The future copyright date may be an anomaly but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is benign, consisting solely of licensing comments with no executable or data-processing elements. No malicious behavior or security risks are present based on the provided content.",
