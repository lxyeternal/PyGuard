  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is just licensing comments with no executable code.\n- No data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n- Confidence is high (1), malware score is 0.\n- Conclusion: The report is accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also correctly identifies the code as a license header.\n- Notes the future-dated copyright (2025) as unusual but not malicious.\n- No data flows or suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0.\n- Conclusion: Valid assessment; no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to previous, identifies only comments.\n- Highlights the future date as an anomaly but not malicious.\n- No data flows or suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence is high (1), malware score is 0.\n- Conclusion: Correct; safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: license header, no executable code.\n- Future date noted as anomaly.\n- No security risks or malware.\n- Confidence is high (1), malware score is 0.\n- Conclusion: Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as others: only comments, no executable code.\n- Future date is the only anomaly.\n- No malware or security risk.\n- Confidence is high (1), malware score is 0.\n- Conclusion: Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely a license header with no executable or malicious content.\n- The only notable anomaly across reports is the future year \"2025\" in the copyright, which is suspicious but not malicious.\n- No data flows, sinks, or malware indicators are present.\n- The malware scores are appropriately set to 0 in all reports.\n- The security risk scores are also correctly set to 0.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since no security issues or malicious activity are detected.\n\n**My own estimate:**\nGiven the content, I agree with the current scores. The code is benign, and the only unusual aspect is the future date, which does not constitute a security risk.\n\n**Therefore:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the actual code content.",
