  "purpose": "This code serves as a licensing header containing copyright and licensing information, with no executable logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it consists solely of comments.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as no data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code contains only static comments.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the future-dated year '2025' in the license, which is suspicious but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a licensing comment block with no executable statements or data handling. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior and note the future date as an anomaly. Malware scores are appropriately set to 0, and security risk scores are also 0, reflecting no security threats. The code's benign nature and lack of obfuscation are consistent with the assessments. The future date does not constitute a security concern but may be a placeholder or typo.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign license header with no malicious or obfuscated content. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
