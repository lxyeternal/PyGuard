{
  "purpose": "The code provides pagers for iterating through list and revision schemas from Google Pub/Sub API responses, both synchronously and asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.api_core and google.pubsub_v1.types; methods that fetch schemas and schema revisions; request and response objects; pagers calling these methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct data sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or system modifications. It primarily wraps API responses and manages iteration.",
  "flows": "Initialization of pagers with API method calls and request/response objects, followed by iteration over pages and schemas, with no untrusted input manipulation or external data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code mainly handles API pagination and attribute forwarding.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for paginating through schemas and schema revisions using provided API methods. It correctly manages request states, retries, and response attributes. There are no signs of code injection, malicious network activity, or data leaks. The structure appears standard for API client pagination wrappers, with no obfuscated code or hidden behavior. No hardcoded credentials or malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of API pagination wrappers for Google Pub/Sub schemas. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages data iteration from API responses, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
