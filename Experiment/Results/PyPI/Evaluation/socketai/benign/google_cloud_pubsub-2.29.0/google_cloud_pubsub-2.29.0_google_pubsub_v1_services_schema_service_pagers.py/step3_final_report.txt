{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes for paginating through Google Pub/Sub schemas API responses, both synchronously and asynchronously, facilitating iteration over schemas and schema revisions.",
  "sources": "API response objects (ListSchemasResponse, ListSchemaRevisionsResponse) and request objects (ListSchemasRequest, ListSchemaRevisionsRequest).",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data exfiltration points; data is only read from API responses and iterated locally.",
  "flows": "The classes retrieve pages via API method calls, follow next_page_token to get subsequent pages, and yield schemas from each page.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK pagination utility, wrapping API responses and providing iteration mechanisms. It uses legitimate Google libraries, handles pagination correctly, and does not process untrusted input in a risky manner. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The scores reflect the benign nature: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard SDK pagination code with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
