{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes to generate SQL queries for Teradata analytics and stored procedures, mainly for internal data processing workflows.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from method parameters such as function arguments, table/view queries, filter expressions, and configuration settings.",
  "sinks": "SQL strings generated for execution, including function calls, query clauses, and SQL statements for procedures.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., function args, filters, table queries) are processed and concatenated into SQL query strings, which are then used for database execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network actions are present. Use of string length calculations for SQL generation could be a point of concern if misused, but appears standard. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names are detected. No hidden or malicious logic evident.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically constructs SQL queries for analytics and stored procedures using parameters provided at runtime. It handles quoting of reserved keywords, generation of argument clauses, and assembly of complex query strings. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. It primarily focuses on SQL string concatenation, which is typical for query builders. The presence of methods like '__process_for_teradata_keyword' and parameter handling functions suggests controlled, predictable behavior. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a query generator for Teradata analytics, with no indications of malicious intent. It performs standard string manipulations to produce SQL commands based on user inputs, with proper handling of reserved keywords. No malicious or sabotage behavior is observed.",
