{
  "purpose": "The code constructs SQL-MR and stored procedure queries for Teradata, facilitating dynamic SQL generation based on input parameters, with handling for keywords, size limits, and execution of nodes when necessary.",
  "sources": "Input arguments such as function names, argument lists, query strings, configuration parameters, and class attributes used to assemble SQL statements.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily concatenates strings to build SQL commands; no external data transmission, network activity, or data exfiltration occurs within this code segment.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed and combined into SQL string components, which are then assembled into complete SQL statements or procedure calls, with size checks and node executions as needed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code relies on external validation for input safety but does not itself perform sanitization or validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured SQL query builder for Teradata, handling keyword quoting, size management, and clause assembly. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious payloads, or network operations. The only potential security concern is SQL injection if inputs are untrusted, but this is outside the code's scope and not indicative of malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting cautious acknowledgment of injection risks without evidence of active vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious utility for generating Teradata SQL and stored procedure commands. It does not exhibit malware, obfuscation, or sabotage behaviors. The slight security risk score accounts for potential injection if inputs are not sanitized externally, but no malicious activity or backdoors are present.",
