  "purpose": "This code provides classes for generating SQL-MR and UAF query strings for Teradata, mainly to facilitate analytical and stored procedure queries programmatically.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration files and constants (e.g., Teradata reserved keywords), method parameters, and internal class variables.",
  "sinks": "String formatting and concatenation for SQL queries, executing node functions via DataFrameUtils._execute_node_return_db_object_name, and potentially passing user input through SQL clause generation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into methods that generate SQL query strings; user-provided data and configuration influence query content; in certain methods, node execution is triggered, e.g., DataFrameUtils._execute_node_return_db_object_name.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to perform typical SQL string construction with no evident hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. Usage of os.path for configuration paths is standard. No suspicious network or data exfiltration code is present. The method for executing nodes based on query size is normal for handling large SQL statements. No malware-like behavior, such as data theft or system disruption, is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly constructs SQL query strings for Teradata's SQL-MR and UAF frameworks. It includes functions for quoting reserved keywords, generating input/output argument clauses, handling query size limits, and executing nodes when query size exceeds limits. The code depends on configuration and external constants but does not process untrusted data directly (beyond string formatting). There are no indications of malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors. The method DataFrameUtils._execute_node_return_db_object_name is invoked to process nodes, which is a standard pattern in distributed query processing. Overall, the logic is consistent with query generation, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed solely for programmatic SQL query generation within a Teradata analytics environment. It does not contain malicious logic or malware indicators. It handles query construction, size management, and node execution in a controlled manner. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security risks in its current form.",
