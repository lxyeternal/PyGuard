  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and risk assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states \"Empty response\" with no code or analysis provided.\n- **Assessment:** No data to evaluate. Cannot determine any issues or malicious activity.\n- **Malware / Security Risk:** Since no code or behavior is described, malware score is 0. The overall risk is negligible.\n- **Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious activity; the report is incomplete.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report describes the code as defining data transformation classes for data preprocessing, emphasizing safe SQL string generation, validation, and no external data leaks.\n- **Findings:**\n  - Input validation appears comprehensive.\n  - SQL syntax strings are generated for internal use.\n  - No external network, file, or command execution.\n  - No obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- **Malware / Security Risk:** The report assigns malware = 0, with high confidence (0.95). The overall security risk is very low (~0.05).\n- **Assessment:** The logic is sound; the code's purpose is legitimate, focusing on safe SQL string construction. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage.\n- **Verdict:** The report is reasonable; the code is secure and behaves as intended.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 2, emphasizing data transformation classes for a database environment, with validation and SQL string creation.\n- **Findings:**\n  - No external data or network operations.\n  - Input validation is thorough.\n  - No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware / Security Risk:** Malware score = 0, confidence = 0.9. The risk is minimal (~0.2).\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with a secure, well-validated data transformation library. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Verdict:** The analysis aligns with the code's purpose; no issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes classes for data preprocessing, similar to previous reports, focusing on safe SQL syntax generation.\n- **Findings:**\n  - No external data leaks or network activity.\n  - Extensive argument validation.\n  - No obfuscation or malicious code.\n  - Purpose is to generate SQL syntax for transformations.\n- **Malware / Security Risk:** Malware = 0, confidence = 1.0, risk ~0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The code is consistent with a secure, legitimate data transformation library. No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** The report is accurate; the code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others—data transformation classes for data preprocessing, with safe SQL string construction.\n- **Findings:**\n  - No external data leaks or network activity.\n  - No obfuscation or suspicious behavior.\n  - Validation is thorough.\n- **Malware / Security Risk:** Malware = 0, confidence = 0.9, risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The code's purpose is clear, and no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Verdict:** The analysis is justified; the code is secure.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0, consistent with clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (~0.05 to 0.2), justified by the absence of external data leaks, network activity, or malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** ~0.1 (average of the reports' assessments)\n\nThe code is a legitimate, well-validated set of data transformation classes intended for safe SQL syntax generation within a database environment. No malicious activity, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and justified. The code is secure, legitimate, and free of malicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate.",
