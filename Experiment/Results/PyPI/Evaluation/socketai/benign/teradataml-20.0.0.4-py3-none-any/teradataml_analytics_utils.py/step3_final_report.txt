{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for displaying and filtering analytic functions, with argument validation and formatting routines, primarily for internal use within a Teradata environment.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters 'type' and 'name' for filtering; uses internal data structures (_JsonStore, _Validators) for function metadata; outputs via print statements.",
  "sinks": "Print statements for output; no external data sinks, network activity, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation -> filtering functions -> formatted output via print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. JSON parsing used for argument validation is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility module designed for listing and filtering function metadata, with argument validation, filtering, and formatted display. It does not perform any network, file, or external data operations. The use of JSON parsing for argument validation and string filtering is appropriate. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is well-structured and intended for internal use, with no external data leaks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for function metadata display and filtering, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
