{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules from the teradataml library and configures session query band parameters for environment setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from teradataml modules and the session_queryband configuration call.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, external communication, or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "Import modules and set session parameters; no data flows or external data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a configuration call for session_queryband, indicating environment setup. No runtime data handling, network activity, or malicious code is present. The import statements are from legitimate, well-known modules within the teradataml SDK. The session_queryband configuration is standard telemetry setup. The code is static, straightforward, and does not perform any suspicious actions or contain obfuscation. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and confidence in benign intent is high.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for the teradataml environment, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with its purpose, and no modifications are necessary.",
