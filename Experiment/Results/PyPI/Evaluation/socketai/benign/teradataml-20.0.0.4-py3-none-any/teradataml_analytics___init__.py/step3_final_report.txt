  "purpose": "Internal functions to process analytic functions, dynamically update function metadata, and map function types to executor class names within the teradataml library.",
  "sources": "External JSON data retrieved via _get_json_data_from_tdml_repo(), used to modify function docstrings, signatures, and parameters.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic attribute modifications on functions within the teradataml module based on external JSON data.",
  "flows": "External JSON data influences function metadata via getattr() and attribute setting, affecting function documentation and signatures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of getattr() and setting __doc__, _signature, and _func_params based on external JSON; no code execution or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves external JSON metadata and updates function attributes dynamically, which could be exploited if JSON data is maliciously crafted. No code injection, network calls, or data exfiltration are present. The primary risk stems from trusting the external JSON source. The code itself is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The use of getattr() and attribute modification is safe if the JSON source is trusted. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score is moderate (~0.2-0.3), reflecting potential manipulation if the JSON source is compromised, but no active malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe from malware and obfuscation. The main security concern is the external JSON data influencing function metadata, which could be manipulated if the source is compromised. No active malicious behavior or payloads are detected. Proper validation and control over the JSON source would mitigate this risk.",
