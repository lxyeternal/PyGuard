{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to handle internal functions related to processing analytic functions, retrieving executor class names based on function types, and attaching metadata to functions within the teradataml package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the package's internal modules, imported functions, and metadata retrieved via _get_json_data_from_tdml_repo().",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network communication, file writing, or executing untrusted commands. The code modifies function docstrings and attributes, which could potentially be exploited if metadata is malicious.",
  "flows": "Metadata retrieved from _get_json_data_from_tdml_repo() flows into the assignment of function docstrings, signatures, and parameters within teradataml. The function _get_executor_class_name() maps input strings to class names.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious strings are present. The code relies on external metadata for function modifications, which could be manipulated if the metadata source is compromised. The metadata source _get_json_data_from_tdml_repo() is external and could potentially introduce malicious data if not secured.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports various modules and defines internal functions for processing analytics and selecting executor classes. The _process_analytic_functions() function dynamically updates function documentation and parameters based on external metadata, which could be risky if the metadata source is malicious or compromised. The _get_executor_class_name() function maps function types to class names using a predefined dictionary, which appears benign. There are no indications of code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration within this code segment. The only potential concern is the reliance on external metadata for modifying functions, which could be manipulated if the metadata is malicious. No sensitive data, credentials, or environment variables are accessed or modified.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain direct malicious behavior but relies on external metadata that could be manipulated if the source is compromised. The functions perform safe operations such as metadata assignment and class name resolution. No malware or security risks are evident within this code segment.",
