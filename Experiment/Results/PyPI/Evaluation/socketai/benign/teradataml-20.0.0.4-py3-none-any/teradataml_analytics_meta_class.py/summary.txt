  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured component of Teradata's analytics SDK, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary risk stems from dynamic import patterns, which are standard but should be managed securely. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting typical plugin system risks."
