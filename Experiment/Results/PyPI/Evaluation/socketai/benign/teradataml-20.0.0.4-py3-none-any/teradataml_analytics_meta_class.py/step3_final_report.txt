  "purpose": "Framework for executing analytic functions within Teradata, involving dynamic import and execution of executor classes, with context and signature validation.",
  "sources": "get_context() calls, class attribute access, dynamic import statements within _common_init",
  "sinks": "Execution of _execute_function methods, attribute access that could invoke external code",
  "flows": "get_context() → _common_init() → dynamic import of executor classes → _execute_function call",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports based on class attributes; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines metaclasses and base classes for analytic functions, relying on dynamic imports and execution. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main security consideration is the dynamic import pattern, which is typical in plugin architectures but could be exploited if inputs are untrusted. Exception handling ensures context and signature validation. Overall, the code appears legitimate and secure within its intended environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured component of Teradata's analytics SDK, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary risk stems from dynamic import patterns, which are standard but should be managed securely. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting typical plugin system risks.",
