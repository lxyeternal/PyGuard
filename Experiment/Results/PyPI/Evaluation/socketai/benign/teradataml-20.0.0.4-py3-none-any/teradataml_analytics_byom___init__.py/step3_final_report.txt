{
  "purpose": "Dynamically creates subclasses of _AnalyticFunction for various prediction functions, assigning them to the global namespace for use in a prediction framework.",
  "sources": "Imports specific classes from teradataml.analytics.byom; uses a list of function names; iterates over the list to generate classes with __init__ calling _common_init.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network calls, or data leaks detected; no sinks related to external data or system modification.",
  "flows": "For each function name, a class is created with __init__ calling _common_init; classes are assigned globally; no data flow beyond class setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda functions inside a loop for __init__ may cause late binding issues, but this is a known pattern and not malicious; reliance on external functions _common_init and _common_dir without their implementation could be a concern if malicious, but no evidence suggests so.",
  "analysis": "The code imports known prediction classes, defines a list of function names, and creates subclasses dynamically, assigning them globally. The pattern is typical for plugin architectures. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The use of lambdas in loops is a common Python pattern, though it can cause late binding issues, but not security concerns here. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Reliance on external functions _common_init and _common_dir warrants trust, but no evidence of malicious intent exists. Overall, the code is a standard setup for prediction function wrappers with no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for setting up prediction function classes in a plugin framework. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The low malware and risk scores are justified and should be maintained.",
