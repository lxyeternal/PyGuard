{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically creates classes for various predictive functions related to 'byom' (bring your own model) using a base analytic class.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'teradataml.analytics.byom' and 'teradataml.analytics.meta_class', list of function names, iteration over '_byom_functions'.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic class creation and initialization via '_common_init', usage of the imported classes.",
  "flows": "Imports → list of function names → dynamic class creation with '_common_init' called in __init__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda function in '__init__' that references '_common_init' with dynamic class creation; no direct input or output data handling is evident. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from a trusted library, defines a list of function names, and then creates new classes dynamically that inherit from '_AnalyticFunction'. Each class's constructor calls '_common_init' with parameters including 'byom'. The approach appears to set up multiple predictive function classes, likely for further use in a larger framework. No indications of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or harmful behavior are present. The use of dynamic class creation is common in frameworks for plugin-like extensions. There are no inputs from external sources, no network activity, or suspicious data handling identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for dynamically defining classes based on a list of function names, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is a typical pattern for plugin or extension frameworks.",
