{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically creates classes for various predictive functions related to 'byom' analytics, likely to be used for machine learning or predictive modeling within the Teradata environment.",
  "sources": "Import statements from teradataml.analytics modules; list of function names; dynamic class creation via globals().",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; potential use of dynamically created classes for model predictions.",
  "flows": "Imports -> iteration over function list -> dynamic class creation -> class initialization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic class creation with lambda functions for __init__, which could obscure behavior or be misused for malicious purposes. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules from the teradataml library, then defines a list of predictive functions. It then iterates over this list to create new classes dynamically, inheriting from _AnalyticFunction. Each class's __init__ method calls _common_init with specific arguments, and the class's __doc__ and __dir____ attributes are set. This pattern is typical for factory or wrapper classes and does not inherently contain malicious behavior. No external data sources or untrusted input handling is present, and the code does not perform any network activity, file access, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard dynamic class creation pattern for wrapping predictive analytic functions. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a typical implementation for such use cases, with no evident security risks or malware. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
