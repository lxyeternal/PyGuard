{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports specific prediction classes and creates subclasses for each of the listed functions, possibly to extend or customize their behavior in a larger analytics framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'teradataml.analytics.byom' and the list '_byom_functions' defining function names.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the dynamically created classes could be used as interfaces for further data processing or prediction tasks; no direct data sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import of classes -> Creation of subclasses with customized __init__ -> Assignment to globals()",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda within a loop to define __init__ method, which may lead to late binding issues; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific prediction classes from the teradataml library, then defines a list of prediction function names. It iterates over this list to create new classes dynamically, inheriting from _AnalyticFunction, with a custom __init__ method that calls _common_init with 'byom' and additional arguments. The created classes are added to the global namespace. No external data input/output, network activity, or obfuscation patterns are present. The use of lambda functions inside a loop is a common Python pattern but can be problematic if not handled correctly due to late binding; however, it does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be for setting up a framework for prediction functions, not for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dynamic class creation pattern to set up prediction function wrappers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is part of an analytic framework setup, with no immediate security concerns.",
