  "purpose": "Define and dynamically create analytic function classes for various predictive models within the teradataml library.",
  "sources": "Imports from teradataml.analytics.byom and teradataml.analytics.meta_class modules, and the list _byom_functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or system effects; no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code initializes classes using imported functions and assigns them to global variables, but no data flow from untrusted sources is observed.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic class creation with lambda functions for __init__ may potentially obscure behavior, but it appears to be standard metaprogramming practice. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from teradataml.analytics.byom modules, which are presumably for predictive analytics. It defines a list of model functions and dynamically creates classes inheriting from _AnalyticFunction, assigning them to global variables. The __init__ method uses a lambda function calling _common_init with parameters. There are no network operations, no input/output handling, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The purpose seems to be to set up analytic function classes for later use, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup for predictive analytic classes within a larger data analytics framework. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on this snippet.",
