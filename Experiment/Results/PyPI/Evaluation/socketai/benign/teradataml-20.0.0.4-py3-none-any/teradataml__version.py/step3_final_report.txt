{
  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a metadata header indicating version information and ownership details, with no executable logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string assignment for 'version' and header comments containing legal notices.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and does not involve data movement or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with standard comments and a simple variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a static version string assignment accompanied by legal header comments. It does not include any dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or obfuscated patterns. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. Given the absence of executable or sensitive operations, there is no justification for higher risk scores. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is straightforward and standard for metadata purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only version information and legal notices. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The current scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
