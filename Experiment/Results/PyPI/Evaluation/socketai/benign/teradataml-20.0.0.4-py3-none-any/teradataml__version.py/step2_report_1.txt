  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content & Context**:  \n   The code consists solely of a static string assignment:\n   ```python\n   version = \"20.00.00.04\"\n   ```\n   accompanied by a header comment with copyright, ownership, and confidentiality notices.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:  \n   - No dynamic code execution, input handling, or network operations.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The comments are standard legal notices, not indicative of malicious intent.\n   - The code is typical for a version or metadata file within a larger codebase.\n\n3. **Assessment of Each Report**:\n   - All reports agree that this is a benign header or metadata snippet.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or malicious indicators are identified.\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Score Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 is appropriate; there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 is appropriate; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 is appropriate; the code does not pose any security risk.\n\n5. **Potential for Reassessment**:\n   - Since the code is purely metadata with no executable or dynamic elements, there's no reason to increase any scores.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Final Conclusion**:  \nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of my assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the actual content of the code.",
