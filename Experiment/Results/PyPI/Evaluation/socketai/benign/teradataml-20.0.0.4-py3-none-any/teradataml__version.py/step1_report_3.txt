  "purpose": "The code appears to be a header comment section and a version string declaration, likely part of a larger codebase, intended for version tracking and licensing information.",
  "sources": "The only source is the static string variable assignment 'version = \"20.00.00.04\"'. No input or data reading functions are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data processing points in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as this is only a comment block and a simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a proprietary comment with confidential and trade secret markings, but nothing unusual or malicious in structure. No hidden code, obfuscation, or suspicious code practices are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment block indicating copyright and confidentiality notices, followed by a straightforward variable assignment of a version string. There is no dynamic code execution, input handling, or suspicious logic. The content does not suggest any malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely informational with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard header and version declaration, offering no indications of malicious or suspicious activity.",
