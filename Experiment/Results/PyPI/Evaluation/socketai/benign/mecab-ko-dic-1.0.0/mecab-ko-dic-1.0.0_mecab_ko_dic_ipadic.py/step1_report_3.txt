  "purpose": "To load version information from a file and configure parameters for a MeCab morphological analyzer instance.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'version' file located within the 'dicdir' directory.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are evident; the code constructs file paths and command-line argument strings.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a local file; constructs command-line arguments for MeCab.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behaviors. No evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. The code reads from local filesystem and constructs command-line arguments safely.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves version information from a local file within a specified directory. It constructs paths to configuration files and command arguments for MeCab. All operations involve local file access and string formatting with local paths, with no external inputs or network activity. The code appears to be straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to configuration management for a MeCab-based tool. No malicious intent or suspicious activity is evident.",
