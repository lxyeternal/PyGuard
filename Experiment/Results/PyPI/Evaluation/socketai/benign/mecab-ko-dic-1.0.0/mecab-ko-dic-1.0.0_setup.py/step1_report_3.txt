  "purpose": "To set up and package the 'mecab-ko-dic' Python package, including metadata and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file from the current directory for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified that lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md file for package description; uses setuptools to find and include package data.",
  "anomalies": "Uses both setuptools and distutils.core.setup, which is redundant but not malicious; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for setup, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() to configure package metadata. The code appears standard for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious behavior. No untrusted input handling, no network calls, no sensitive data processing, and no suspicious code flows observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
