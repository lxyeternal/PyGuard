{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'mecab-ko-dic' for distribution, including metadata and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file from the current directory to include as long_description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or could cause data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Reads file content and passes package metadata to setuptools for package installation; no flow from untrusted source to sensitive sink.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'distutils.core' alongside 'setuptools', which is unconventional but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns, no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup tasks, reading a README file for description. No untrusted data input, no code injection, nor malicious actions. The code appears standard for a setup script, with no anomalies or malicious indicators. Usage of 'distutils' and 'setuptools' is common, and no suspicious code or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard, benign Python package configuration file with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
