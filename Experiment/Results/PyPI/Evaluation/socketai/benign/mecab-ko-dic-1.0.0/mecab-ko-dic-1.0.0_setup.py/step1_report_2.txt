{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the Python package 'mecab-ko-dic' for distribution via setuptools",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file from the package directory",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows to external sinks such as network, file system, or environment variables",
  "flows": "Reading README file does not connect to any untrusted data flow or external output",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'distutils.core' instead of the more modern 'setuptools' only, which is less common but not malicious; no suspicious code or secrets found",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for setup, reads the README file for the long description, and calls 'setup' with package metadata. No code injection, hidden code, or suspicious behaviors are present. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or data leakage points are evident. The use of 'distutils.core' alongside 'setuptools' is slightly unusual but not malicious. No obfuscated code or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected. The code correctly reads the README for documentation purposes and calls 'setup' with package metadata. No signs of malware or security risks found.",
