{
  "purpose": "To set up and package the 'mecab-ko-dic' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; importing setuptools, distutils, io, and os modules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; no execution of external commands or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Reading local file content for package description; configuration data flow for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'distutils.core' alongside 'setuptools' is redundant but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected; no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for packaging, reads the README file for the long description, and calls 'setup' with package metadata. No untrusted data handling, no external network connections, and no code that appears malicious or suspicious. The use of both 'distutils' and 'setuptools' is outdated but not harmful. Overall, the script functions as a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious behavior detected. It correctly reads local files and configures package metadata for distribution. No security concerns or malicious code elements are present.",
