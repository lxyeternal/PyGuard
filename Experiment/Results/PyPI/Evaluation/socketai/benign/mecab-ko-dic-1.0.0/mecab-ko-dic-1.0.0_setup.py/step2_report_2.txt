  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** Confirms the script is a standard setup script, reads 'README.md' with proper encoding, no suspicious behavior, uses 'distutils.core' alongside 'setuptools' (redundant but not malicious).  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard setup tasks, no malicious behavior, notes the unusual but benign use of 'distutils.core'.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard packaging script, no malicious code, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard nature, no malicious behavior, mentions the redundant use of 'distutils' but harmless.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Also finds no malicious activity, notes the outdated use of 'distutils' but considers it benign.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (slightly elevated).  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score seems to be a cautious default, but given the code, there's no actual security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports agree the code is standard and benign.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. No malicious code, external network activity, or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscated or hidden code is present.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 or very close to 0; report 5 suggests 0.1, but given the code, this is an overestimation.\n\n### Justification of scores:\n\n- The code performs only standard package setup tasks: importing modules, reading a local README file, calling 'setup' with metadata.  \n- No external network calls, no code injection, no use of eval or exec, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.  \n- The use of 'distutils.core' alongside 'setuptools' is redundant but not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to zero) — the minimal risk of misconfiguration or outdated practices does not translate into a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The slight redundancy in imports does not impact security.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further analysis or clarification.",
