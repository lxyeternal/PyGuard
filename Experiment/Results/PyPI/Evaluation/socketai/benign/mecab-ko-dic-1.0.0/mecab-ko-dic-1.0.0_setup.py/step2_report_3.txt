  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code, a setup script for packaging a Python project.\n- The code reads 'README.md' with UTF-8 encoding, imports modules, and calls `setup()` with package metadata.\n- Use of both `distutils.core` and `setuptools` is redundant but not malicious.\n- No external network activity, code injection, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code functions as intended for a setup script. No issues with the logic or execution flow.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Anomalies:** The only minor anomaly is the redundant use of `distutils.core` alongside `setuptools`, which is not best practice but not harmful.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - **malware:** 0\n  - **obfuscated:** 0\n  - **securityRisk:** 0 or very close to 0 (some mention 0.1, which is negligible)\n  - **confidence:** 0.95 to 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\nThese scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Risk justification:\n- Since no malicious activity, data leaks, or vulnerabilities are present, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n- The minimal anomaly (use of both `distutils` and `setuptools`) does not warrant a higher score.\n\n### Malware and obfuscated scores:\n- Both are correctly assigned as 0, since there's no malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard setup script with no security issues.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, straightforward, and safe. The scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated, with a risk score of zero.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate. No modifications needed. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
