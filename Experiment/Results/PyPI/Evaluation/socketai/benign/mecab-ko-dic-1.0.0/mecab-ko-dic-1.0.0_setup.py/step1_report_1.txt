  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'mecab-ko-dic' Python package, including metadata and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content (source) used as long_description (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'distutils.core' alongside 'setuptools' is redundant but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard package setup tasks: importing modules, reading a README file, and configuring package metadata. The 'README.md' is read with specified encoding, which is typical. No external network calls, code execution, or suspicious behavior observed. The inclusion of 'distutils.core' is unnecessary but not harmful. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code found.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
