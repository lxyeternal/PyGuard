  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python project 'mecab-ko-dic'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file, imports 'setuptools' and 'distutils.core', and calls 'setup()' with package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Reads local README file, passes package info to 'setup()' without dynamic code execution or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant import of 'distutils.core' alongside 'setuptools' but no malicious intent; no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It reads a local README file with proper encoding and calls 'setup()' with package metadata. The use of both 'setuptools' and 'distutils.core' is redundant but not malicious. There are no network calls, code injection, obfuscated code, or secrets. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified given the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious or security issues. The reports correctly identify its safety. No modifications are necessary; the scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low or zero security risk.",
