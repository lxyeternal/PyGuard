{
  "purpose": "Read a version string from a file in a specified directory and set configuration variables for a MeCab tagger.",
  "sources": "The function _get_version reads data from a file named 'version' located in the 'dicdir' directory.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs command-line arguments for MeCab using the data in mecabrc and DICDIR, but does not execute external commands.",
  "flows": "The version string read from the 'version' file flows into the VERSION variable, used for configuration; no untrusted data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code are present. The code reads a local file without validation, but this is standard for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code determines its current directory, constructs a path to a 'dicdir' subdirectory, reads the version from a file within that directory, and builds command-line arguments for MeCab. It uses standard Python functions and string formatting without executing untrusted data or including malicious logic. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The use of open() is straightforward and limited to local file reading.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs simple configuration setup tasks with no malicious intent or security issues. It reads local files and constructs command-line parameters safely, assuming the local environment is secure.",
