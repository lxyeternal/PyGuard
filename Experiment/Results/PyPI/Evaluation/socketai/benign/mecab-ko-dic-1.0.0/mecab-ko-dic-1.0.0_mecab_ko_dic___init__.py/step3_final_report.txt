  "purpose": "Load version information from a local 'version' file within a specified directory and prepare configuration paths and arguments for MeCab.",
  "sources": "Reading 'version' file in 'dicdir' directory, constructing paths for 'mecabrc' and 'dicdir' based on script location.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data flow or untrusted data handling beyond local file reads.",
  "flows": "Reading 'version' file -> constructing 'mecabrc' path -> formatting 'MECAB_ARGS' string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward file I/O and path manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple local file reads and path constructions without executing external commands or processing untrusted input. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. It solely sets configuration variables for a text processing tool. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2). The code's operations are standard and safe, with minimal risk associated with reading files without validation, which is typical in configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration loader with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
