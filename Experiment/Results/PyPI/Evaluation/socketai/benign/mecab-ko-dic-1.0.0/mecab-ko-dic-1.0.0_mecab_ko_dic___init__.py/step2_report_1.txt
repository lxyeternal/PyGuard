  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a function `_get_version` that reads a 'version' file from a given directory.\n- Determines the current script directory.\n- Sets `DICDIR` to a subdirectory 'dicdir' within the script directory.\n- Reads the version from the 'version' file in `DICDIR`.\n- Constructs `mecabrc` path and `MECAB_ARGS` string for configuring MeCab.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- All operations are local file reads and path manipulations.\n- No external network activity, no data exfiltration.\n- No user input processing, no command execution beyond string formatting.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code appears benign; no malicious behavior or security risks are evident.\n- The operations are straightforward configuration setup.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is standard and safe.\n- Minor note: using string formatting for command-line args could be unsafe if variables are manipulated, but in this context, variables are controlled and derived from local files, so no immediate risk.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware score = 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.2), which aligns with the benign nature.\n- Confidence scores are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), consistent with the clear, safe code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code only reads local files and constructs command-line arguments without executing external commands or handling untrusted input, a risk score above 0.1-0.2 is unwarranted.\n- Malware score remains 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- The reports' assessments are reasonable.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is claimed or implied.\n- No obfuscation detected.\n- The code's purpose is configuration loading, not code execution or data processing that could be exploited.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to reliance on local files but no security concern)  \n\nThe overall evaluation confirms the code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward configuration loader for a MeCab-based application.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity detected.\n- Scores assigned in reports are reasonable; I would keep them as is, with perhaps a very slight increase in security risk score (to 0.1) due to reliance on local files, but it's negligible.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, and the scores reflect that. No further action needed.",
