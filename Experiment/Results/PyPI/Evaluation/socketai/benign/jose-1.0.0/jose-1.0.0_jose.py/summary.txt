  "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate, well-implemented cryptographic library for token handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects the inherent complexity of cryptography but no specific vulnerabilities or malicious intent. It is safe for deployment in security-sensitive contexts assuming proper usage."
