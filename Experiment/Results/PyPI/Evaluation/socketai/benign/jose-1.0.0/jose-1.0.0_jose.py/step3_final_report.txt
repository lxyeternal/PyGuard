  "purpose": "Cryptographic utility functions for JWT, JWE, and JWS token handling, including encryption, decryption, signing, and verification using standard algorithms and libraries.",
  "sources": "Input claims, cryptographic keys (JWK), headers, and optional additional data for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Generated tokens (JWE, JWS, JWT), cryptographic operations, and validation routines; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Claims and keys are processed through cryptographic primitives, with source data (claims, headers) flowing into encryption/signature functions, resulting in serialized tokens; decryption and verification reverse this flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of temporary versioning attributes for legacy support; no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious control flow detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cryptographic procedures for JWT/JWE/JWS with proper validation, error handling, and use of well-known algorithms. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The temporary versioning is explicitly stated as legacy support, not malicious intent. The cryptographic primitives are used correctly, and the code structure is clear and maintainable. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's content and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate, well-implemented cryptographic library for token handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects the inherent complexity of cryptography but no specific vulnerabilities or malicious intent. It is safe for deployment in security-sensitive contexts assuming proper usage.",
