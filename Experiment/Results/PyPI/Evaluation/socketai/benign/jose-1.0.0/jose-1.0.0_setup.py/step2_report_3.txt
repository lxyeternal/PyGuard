  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The script is a standard setup configuration. It reads dependencies, metadata, and environment variables without executing untrusted code. No malicious patterns or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; the script appears benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, a standard packaging script. No suspicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. Reads external files and environment variables safely.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No security concerns; normal packaging code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a straightforward setup script. The only slight concern is the use of environment variable 'JOSE_RELEASE' to influence the release version, which could be manipulated externally. However, this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — a small risk score is justified given external control over versioning but not malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; just a minor security consideration.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports. No suspicious code, no dynamic execution, no obfuscation. Environment variables are used in a standard way.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion; standard setup script with no malicious patterns. Environment variables are used for versioning, which is typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — slightly higher risk score, possibly due to environment variable usage, but still not malicious.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code Presence:** All reports confirm the code is a standard setup script.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign zero malware risk, which is appropriate. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Minor risk scores (0.1-0.2) are justified due to external environment variable influence, but this is common and not malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minor, related to external control of versioning, but not a security threat.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard packaging script with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The small risk score reflects the potential for external manipulation via environment variables but does not indicate an actual security breach.\n\n**Recommendation:** No further action needed. Continue monitoring for any future anomalies but based on current evidence, this code is safe.",
