  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python module named 'jose', including RPM package customization.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt', 'README', 'CHANGES', 'CONTRIB' files, environment variables, and sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of package requirements, environment variables for release, and setup configuration parameters.",
  "flows": "Reading external files and environment variables as sources, used in setup configuration and requirement processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads data from external files (requirements, README, CHANGES, CONTRIB), environment variables, and command-line arguments. It processes package requirements and constructs RPM specifications accordingly. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a standard setup script with some customization for RPM packaging, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for packaging a Python project with RPM support. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks in the provided code.",
