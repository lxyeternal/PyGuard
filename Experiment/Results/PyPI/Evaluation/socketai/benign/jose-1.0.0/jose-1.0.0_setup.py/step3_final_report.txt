  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'jose' module, reading dependencies, metadata, and configuring RPM build parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt', 'README', 'CHANGES', 'CONTRIB' files, environment variable 'JOSE_RELEASE', and command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables and command-line args to influence build metadata; no untrusted code execution or data transmission.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and environment variables; modifies package name and dependencies based on version and args; no dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable 'JOSE_RELEASE' to set release version, which could be externally manipulated, but this is standard practice in build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python module, with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. It reads static files and environment variables safely, and modifies package dependencies and metadata in a straightforward manner. The use of environment variables for versioning is common, though it could be manipulated externally, but does not lead to malicious activity. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security risks. The minor risk score reflects the potential for environment variable manipulation but does not indicate malicious activity.",
