No signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or high security risks are evident. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the slight security risk reflects inherent sensitivities in cryptographic and network operations but does not indicate vulnerabilities or malicious intent."

The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the external Cognito class's implementation. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and the risk score is low (~0.1-0.2). The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."
