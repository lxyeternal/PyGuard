  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The setup script reads 'README.md' via Path().read_text() for long description, with no suspicious code execution or external data manipulation. It only configures package metadata and dependencies.  \n- **Malware & Risks:** No malware, no security risks, straightforward code.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard setup script, reads static data, no untrusted input, no suspicious code.  \n- **Malware & Risks:** No malware, no vulnerabilities.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Again, standard setup with static data, no dynamic code, no external untrusted data.  \n- **Malware & Risks:** No malware, no security risks.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, reads 'README.md' and static data, no suspicious code.  \n- **Malware & Risks:** No malware, no vulnerabilities.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard package setup, no external untrusted input or suspicious code.  \n- **Malware & Risks:** No malware, no security issues.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- All reports consistently identify the setup script as benign, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only dynamic operation is reading the 'README.md' file, which is standard and not suspicious.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent is present.\n- The dependency list is common and does not raise concerns.\n\n### Final Score Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** 0; no security vulnerabilities or risks identified.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- The code is a typical, well-structured setup.py for a Python package.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the analysis aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe overall assessment confirms that this setup script is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and risk, with obfuscation also at zero.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis above.",
