  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'pycognito' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; only package metadata is handled.",
  "flows": "Reading content from 'README.md' and passing it to setup() for package description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Path().read_text() to read 'README.md' without validation; no suspicious code execution, secrets, or external data manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily configures package metadata and dependencies using setuptools. It reads the long description from 'README.md', which is a standard practice. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or data leaks are evident. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activities are present. The dependencies listed are common libraries for AWS and JWT handling. Overall, the code appears to be a standard setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a typical package configuration file for Python distribution. It contains no malicious code or behavior. No security risks are identified.",
