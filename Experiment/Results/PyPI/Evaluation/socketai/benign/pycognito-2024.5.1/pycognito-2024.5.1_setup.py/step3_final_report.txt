  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script configuring metadata, dependencies, and reading long description from README.md.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' via Path().read_text() for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs processed; no sinks indicating data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Static data assignment; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with static metadata and dependencies. It reads a local README.md file for description, which is standard. No dynamic code execution, user input, environment variables, or network activity is present. The dependencies are common packages related to AWS and JWT. The code structure is simple, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. All reports confirm the benign nature, assigning scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leaks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All evidence and reports support this conclusion, and the current scores are appropriate.",
