{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the pycognito package, intended to facilitate installation and distribution of the package and its dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the version string, reading the README.md file for long description, defining package metadata, and specifying dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data; no data sinks that could lead to leaks or malicious execution are present.",
  "flows": "The version string is used in the download URL; the README.md content is read for long description; dependencies are specified for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Use of standard setup tools and dependency listing. No malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for a Python package using setuptools. It reads static data such as version and README.md, specifies dependencies, and sets package metadata. No input from external sources at runtime, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network activity. All components follow typical package setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard package configuration tasks without external input or risky operations.",
