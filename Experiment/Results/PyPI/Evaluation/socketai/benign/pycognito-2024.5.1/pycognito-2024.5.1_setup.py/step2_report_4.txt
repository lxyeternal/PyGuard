  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup script reading README.md for long description.\n- Data flow: Static, no untrusted input.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Conclusion: Benign, typical package setup.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, standard setup.\n- Data flow: Static, no untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: Benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup, reading version and README.md.\n- Data flow: Static, no untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: Typical, safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup with metadata.\n- Data flow: Static.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Data flow: Static.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis:\n- All reports consistently find no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code is a straightforward setup.py script, with no dynamic code execution, no external data processing, and no suspicious patterns.\n- The only potentially dynamic part is reading 'README.md', which is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or code hiding techniques)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n- **Confidence:** 1 (all reports agree)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The package dependencies are common and benign.\n- The code is standard for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, or external data manipulations are present.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package. There are no security concerns or malicious behaviors detected. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- Keep confidence at 1.\n- No changes needed.",
