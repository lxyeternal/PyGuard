{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'pycognito', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the package version, reading the README.md file for long description, reading dependencies, and retrieving package information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; setup parameters are static or derived from local files, not user input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the data flow involves static assignment and reading local files for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, defines a version string, and calls 'setup' with static package metadata and dependencies. The 'long_description' is read from a local file, which is a common pattern. No code executes untrusted input or performs network operations. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The code appears safe and consistent with common packaging practices.",
