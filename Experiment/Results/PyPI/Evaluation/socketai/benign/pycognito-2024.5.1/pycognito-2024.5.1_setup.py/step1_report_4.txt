{
  "purpose": "This script defines the setup configuration for the 'pycognito' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string, package description from README.md, and package requirements from install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or used in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the script only defines package setup data without dynamic input or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with no unusual or suspicious code structures. The only potentially dynamic element is reading the README.md file, which is typical.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'pathlib' and 'setuptools' to define package setup parameters. It sets a static version string and reads the long description from a local README.md file. The setup() call specifies package metadata, classifiers, download URL, keywords, author info, dependencies, and Python version requirements. All operations are static and standard for Python package setup. No code injection, environment variable misuse, or malicious behavior is present. No obfuscated or suspicious code features detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution, with no data leaks, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
