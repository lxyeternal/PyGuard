{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pycognito' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, hardcoded string literals for package info, and dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used or could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; data is static or predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup.py structure, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules for filesystem paths and package setup. It defines a version string and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are processed. No obfuscated code, network calls, or code execution are present. The dependencies are common libraries for AWS and security features, with no suspicious or malicious entries. The script is typical for Python package distribution and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads static data and sets package metadata without executing any suspicious or harmful operations.",
