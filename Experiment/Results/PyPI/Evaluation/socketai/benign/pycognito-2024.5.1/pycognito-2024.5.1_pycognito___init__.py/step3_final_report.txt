  "purpose": "AWS Cognito client wrapper for user management, authentication, token verification, MFA, and identity provider configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., COGNITO_JWKS), network requests to fetch JWKS, user input, AWS SDK calls.",
  "sinks": "Network requests, environment variables, AWS SDK interactions, token handling.",
  "flows": "JWKS fetched from URL or environment variable -> token verification -> user attribute management -> MFA workflows -> AWS SDK calls for user/group management.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code injection, no backdoors, no malicious network activity beyond standard JWKS fetch.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured wrapper around AWS Cognito SDK, following best practices for token verification, secret hash computation, MFA, and user management. External JWKS retrieval is handled securely via environment variables or network requests. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. External dependencies and network interactions are standard for such SDKs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate AWS Cognito client library with no malicious intent or supply chain security issues. It adheres to security best practices, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage. The overall security risk is very low.",
