  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of AWS Cognito SRP authentication and device management. No signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or high security risks are evident. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the slight security risk reflects inherent sensitivities in cryptographic and network operations but does not indicate vulnerabilities or malicious intent."
