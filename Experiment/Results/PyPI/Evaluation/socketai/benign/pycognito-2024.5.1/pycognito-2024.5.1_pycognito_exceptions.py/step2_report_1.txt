  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines several custom exception classes for an authentication library (pyCognito).\n   - The classes include `WarrantException`, `ForceChangePasswordException`, `TokenVerificationException`, `MFAChallengeException`, and its subclasses.\n   - The `MFAChallengeException` stores tokens and provides a method `get_tokens()` to retrieve them.\n   - No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or network calls are present.\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as error handling classes.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - Confirmed: The code does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The only potential concern is the storage and retrieval of tokens in exceptions (`get_tokens()`), which could lead to token leakage if exception objects are improperly logged or exposed. However, this is a common pattern in exception handling and not inherently malicious.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Report**:\n   - **Reports 1, 2, 3, 5**: They uniformly state that the code is purely definitional, with no malicious or security risks. They assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0 or very low.\n   - **Report 4**: Notes the potential risk associated with storing tokens in exceptions but clarifies that no malicious behavior is detected. It assigns a security risk score of 0.2, which seems reasonable given the potential for token exposure if mishandled, but not malicious in itself.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports agree on 0, which is correct.\n   - **Risk Score**: Most reports assign 0, with one (Report 4) assigning 0.2. Given the benign nature of the code but noting the token storage concern, a small risk score of 0.1-0.2 is appropriate.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is straightforward, defining exception classes with no malicious intent.\n   - The only minor concern is token exposure via exception objects, but this is a common pattern and not malicious.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 (to reflect minor concern about token handling, but overall benign)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a standard, legitimate set of exception class definitions for an authentication library. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The small risk score accounts for token storage in exceptions, which should be handled cautiously in production but is not inherently dangerous.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: Always ensure that exception objects containing sensitive data like tokens are not logged or exposed inadvertently in production environments.",
