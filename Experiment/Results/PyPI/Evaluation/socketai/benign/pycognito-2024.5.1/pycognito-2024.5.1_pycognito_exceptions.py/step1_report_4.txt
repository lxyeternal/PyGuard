  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various errors related to authentication and MFA in pyCognito.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and constructor methods within the code.",
  "sinks": "Method get_tokens() which returns stored tokens; potential exposure if tokens are sensitive.",
  "flows": "Tokens are stored in an instance variable and retrieved via get_tokens(), which could lead to leakage if misused.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; exception handling and class inheritance are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception. The MFAChallengeException class stores tokens and provides a method to retrieve them. This storage and retrieval pattern could potentially lead to token exposure if the exception objects are improperly handled or logged. However, there are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose of exception handling for an authentication library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent detected. The only potential security consideration is the handling of tokens within exceptions, which should be logged or exposed cautiously. Overall, it poses no significant security risks.",
