  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error scenarios in pyCognito operations",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading present in the code",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or external system interaction present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and methods",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. The initial classes serve as base and specific exceptions for password change, token verification, and MFA challenges. The MFAChallengeException class stores message and tokens, providing a method to retrieve tokens. The subclasses for software token and SMS MFA are straightforward and only differentiate the MFA method via class names. No data is read, no external calls, no dynamic code, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining exception classes without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger authentication library without any security risks.",
