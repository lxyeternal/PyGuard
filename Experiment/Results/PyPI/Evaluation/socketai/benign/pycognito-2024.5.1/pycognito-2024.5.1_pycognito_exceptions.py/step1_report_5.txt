{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for pyCognito-related errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions are static",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that process untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as these are exception class definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions, no obfuscation or hidden code",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, inheriting from the base Exception class. No input handling, data processing, or external communications are present. The __init__ method in MFAChallengeException stores tokens but does not perform any suspicious actions such as network communication or data exfiltration. Overall, the code appears to serve as part of an error handling framework without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in a Python library, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
