  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the reported observations against the code.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code only defines exception classes inheriting from `Exception`.\n- No external data reading, processing, or output occurs.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The only notable aspect is that `MFAChallengeException` stores tokens and provides a getter, which could potentially be misused if exceptions are logged or mishandled, but this is a standard pattern in exception handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and evaluations per report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Defines custom exceptions for pyCognito operations.\n- **Findings:** No data input/output, no anomalies, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, benign class definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining exception classes.\n- **Findings:** No data processing, no external calls, no anomalies.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard exception classes, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Again, defining exception classes.\n- **Findings:** No data handling, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign class definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Defines exception classes, notes that `get_tokens()` returns stored tokens.\n- **Findings:** Tokens stored in exceptions could be exposed if mishandled; no malicious behavior.\n- **Security note:** Token storage in exceptions could be a concern if logs or error reports include exception objects with tokens, but this is a typical pattern and not inherently malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, just a security consideration regarding token handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — **reasonable**.\n\n**Justification:** Since tokens are stored and retrievable, and could be sensitive, a small security risk score is justified. No malware detected.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous reports.\n- **Findings:** No data processing, no anomalies.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard exception classes.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely class definitions with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly zero across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly zero, with a slight 0.2 for the token storage pattern (Report 4), which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and align with the code's nature.\n- The only point of note is the token storage in exceptions, which could be a security concern if exception objects are logged or mishandled. However, this is a common pattern in exception handling and not inherently malicious.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 — minor concern about token storage, but overall very low risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign.
