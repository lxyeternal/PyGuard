  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n1. **Code Verification:**\n   - The code only defines custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - No dynamic code, data processing, external calls, or data input/output occurs.\n   - The `MFAChallengeException` stores tokens and provides a getter method, which is standard practice but could pose token leakage if exceptions are logged improperly.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in stating that the code is purely structural and benign.\n   - They correctly identify that the only potential concern is the storage and retrieval of tokens in exceptions, which could lead to token exposure if exception objects are mishandled or logged.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 or very low (0.2 in one report)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The `securityRisk` score of 0.2 in report 4 seems cautious but reasonable, considering token storage in exceptions could be a minor risk if mishandled.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign scores higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n   - The only minor concern is token storage in exceptions, but without evidence of mishandling or malicious intent, this does not warrant a high risk score.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware` as 0.\n   - No malicious activity is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they focus on structural analysis.\n   - The only potential concern (token storage) is acknowledged but not overestimated.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n   - The overall assessment that this code is benign and purely structural is justified.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (minor concern about token storage, but not a security flaw)\n\n**My Personal Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (consistent with the cautious note about token handling)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. The only minor point is the storage of tokens in exceptions, which should be handled carefully in practice but does not constitute a security risk by itself.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is, with perhaps a slight adjustment of the risk score to 0.1 for an even more conservative stance.",
