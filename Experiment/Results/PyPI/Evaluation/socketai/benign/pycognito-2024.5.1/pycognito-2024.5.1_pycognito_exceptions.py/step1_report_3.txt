{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various authentication and MFA-related errors in the pyCognito library",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; exception classes do not read input or data",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data is processed or output",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from source to sink as no input or output operations are performed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded strings are typical for exception messages; no suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with some constructors and methods for storing and retrieving tokens. No input handling, no external data processing, no code execution, nor network activity. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of exception class definitions with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes for authentication flows. No malicious intent, no security risks detected.",
