{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling authentication and MFA-related errors in the pyCognito library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via exception instantiation and stores tokens within exception objects.",
  "sinks": "The get_tokens() method exposes stored tokens, which could be leaked if exceptions are logged or mishandled.",
  "flows": "Tokens are stored during exception creation and retrieved via get_tokens(), potentially leading to token exposure if exceptions are logged.",
  "anomalies": "Storing tokens in exception objects could pose a security concern if exceptions are logged; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions with minimal logic. No dynamic code, external calls, or obfuscation are present. The only potential security concern is token storage in exceptions, which could lead to leakage if exceptions are improperly logged. The code is straightforward, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the token handling pattern, but overall the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for an authentication library. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The minor concern regarding token storage is acknowledged but does not constitute a security risk in itself.",
