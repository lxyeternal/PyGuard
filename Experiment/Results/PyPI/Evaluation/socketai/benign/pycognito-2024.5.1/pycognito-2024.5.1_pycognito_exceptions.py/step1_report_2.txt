  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various authentication and MFA-related errors in pyCognito.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; the code only defines classes and methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; classes are used for exception handling only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of class definitions with straightforward inheritance and no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes for specific error scenarios in pyCognito, including token verification, MFA challenges, and forced password changes. The classes include basic constructors and accessor methods without any dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious code constructs present. The structure is standard for Python exception handling, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, establishing custom exceptions for pyCognito without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not process or leak data, nor does it contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
