  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code only defines custom exception classes related to authentication and MFA flows.\n   - No data input/output, external calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - The classes are straightforward, inheriting from Exception, with minimal constructors and accessor methods.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent in stating that the code is purely structural and benign.\n   - They correctly identify that the only potential concern is token storage in exceptions, which could be misused if exceptions are logged or mishandled, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n   - No inaccuracies or logical flaws are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - Security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.2), which is appropriate given the context.\n   - Obfuscation scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), reflecting the clear and simple nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports justify a risk higher than 0.2, and given the benign nature, this is appropriate.\n   - The only minor concern is token storage, but it does not constitute a security risk in isolation.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, correctly indicating no malicious intent or behavior.\n   - No evidence of backdoors, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not rely on unfounded assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - The only consideration is token handling, which is standard in exception classes and not inherently risky.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - The high confidence and zero malware/obfuscation scores match the benign assessment.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is purely definitional, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The only minor security consideration is token handling, but it does not elevate the risk.\n- Overall, the scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal concern about token exposure, but not significant)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for an authentication library. No security risks or malware are present, and the scores assigned are reasonable.",
