  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured AWS Cognito token management plugin for requests, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the external Cognito class's implementation. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and the risk score is low (~0.1-0.2). The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."
