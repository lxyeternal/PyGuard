{
  "purpose": "The code loads package metadata from a static JSON string, reads a README.md file, and invokes setuptools.setup() to configure the package installation.",
  "sources": "The JSON string containing package metadata and the local README.md file.",
  "sinks": "The call to setuptools.setup() which processes the package configuration.",
  "flows": "The JSON data is parsed and passed directly to setup(), with the README content assigned to 'long_description'.",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic code execution, external inputs, secrets, or obfuscation detected. The JSON is static and trusted.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations with static data, no external or untrusted inputs, and no obfuscation. It reads a local README file and a hardcoded JSON string, then calls setuptools.setup() with this data. No suspicious or malicious activity, network activity, or code injection is present. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
