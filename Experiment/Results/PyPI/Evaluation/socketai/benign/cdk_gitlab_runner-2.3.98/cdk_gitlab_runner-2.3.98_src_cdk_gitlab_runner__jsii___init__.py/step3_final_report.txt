  "purpose": "Initialize package path, import modules, perform version-dependent type checking, load JSII assembly, and publish the package.",
  "sources": "Reading __path__, importing modules, retrieving package version, environment variables, and assembly load parameters.",
  "sinks": "Assembly loading via jsii.JSIIAssembly.load, publication.publish() call.",
  "flows": "Version retrieval -> conditional typeguard logic -> assembly load -> publish.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic assembly loading and version-dependent logic are standard in infrastructure SDKs; no suspicious data flows or code obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks involving path extension, version parsing, conditional type checking, and assembly loading. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The use of environment-dependent logic and assembly loading is typical for JSII-based infrastructure packages. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, risk=0.1-0.2, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard package initialization script for an infrastructure SDK component. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate; malware score should be explicitly set to 0, and risk remains minimal.",
