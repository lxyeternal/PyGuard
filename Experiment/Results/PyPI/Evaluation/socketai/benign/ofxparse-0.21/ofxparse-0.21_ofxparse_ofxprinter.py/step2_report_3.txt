  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward OFX formatter, reading data from structured objects and writing to files.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are identified.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1 to 0.2), aligning with the low threat level of a data formatting utility.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9 to 0.95), indicating strong agreement among reviewers.\n\n**Confirmations and Validations:**\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- No signs of code injection, dynamic code execution, or external network activity.\n- The data flows are from trusted object attributes to file output.\n- The file writing operations are standard and controlled.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n- The only minor concern could be the direct writing of data from 'ofx' objects, which might include untrusted data. However, given the context (financial data export), this is expected and standard practice.\n- No indication of malicious intent or malware in the code.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- Malware score: 0 is appropriate; no malicious behavior detected.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n- Risk score: Given the low threat level, a score around 0.1-0.2 is justified.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is a legitimate, well-structured OFX file generator.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The code should be considered low risk, with no malware concerns.\n\n**My own estimate for scores:**\n- Malware: **0**\n- Obfuscated: **0**\n- Security risk: **0.1** (slightly above zero due to direct data output, but negligible)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate. The code is safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate.",
