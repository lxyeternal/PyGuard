{
  "purpose": "This code defines module exports and imports specific classes and exceptions from local modules related to OFX parsing and printing.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .ofxparse and .ofxprinter",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file writes, or eval/exec functions present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports and module metadata",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and exceptions from local modules and defines a version string and an __all__ list for exports. There are no inputs, no processing, and no potential injection points. The imported modules are assumed to be part of the same package and do not introduce malicious behavior by themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module entry point or __init__.py file, defining exports and versioning without any malicious intent or security risks.",
