  "purpose": "Module initializer that imports classes and exceptions from local modules for OFX parsing and printing, setting up module exports.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from '.ofxparse' and '.ofxprinter' modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data read or write operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static imports and variable definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export setup with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module setup, importing specific classes and exceptions from local modules, defining a version, and setting the __all__ list. It contains no dynamic code, network operations, or handling of untrusted input. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no malicious intent or security issues. The imported modules are assumed safe; this snippet alone does not present vulnerabilities or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks or malicious behavior. It functions solely as a module initializer with no suspicious features.",
