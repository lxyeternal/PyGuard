  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for loading fixture files, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security risk is potential directory traversal due to unsanitized 'filename' input. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation score is 0. The security risk score should be around 0.2, reflecting the potential for misuse if 'filename' is controlled by an attacker. Overall, the code is benign but warrants input validation in production to prevent exploitation."
