{
  "purpose": "Load a file from the 'fixtures' directory, optionally within 'tests' if present.",
  "sources": "The 'filename' argument and the directory listing of '.' to check for 'tests'.",
  "sinks": "The 'open()' function used to read the file at the constructed path.",
  "flows": "The 'filename' input influences the path construction; the path is then used directly in 'open()'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; potential for directory traversal if 'filename' includes '../'.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a file path by joining 'fixtures' with 'filename'. If 'tests' exists in the current directory, it prepends 'tests' to the path. The 'filename' is user-controlled and not sanitized, which could allow directory traversal attacks. The function then opens the file in binary mode. No malicious code or obfuscation is present; the core concern is the lack of input validation, which could be exploited in untrusted environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for loading fixture files, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security risk is potential directory traversal due to unsanitized 'filename' input. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation score is 0. The security risk score should be around 0.2, reflecting the potential for misuse if 'filename' is controlled by an attacker. Overall, the code is benign but warrants input validation in production to prevent exploitation.",
