  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the ofxparse Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading __version__ from __init__.py, reading README file, import statements, and setup configuration data.",
  "sinks": "None of the code shows untrusted data handling or external command execution.",
  "flows": "Reading version from file -> setting up package metadata -> invoking setup() with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code reads version info and README content from local files; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package metadata and setup configurations. It reads the version number from a source file to avoid importing the package during install, which is a common practice. The dependencies are standard packages. No external input handling, command execution, or suspicious logic is present. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The overall structure is straightforward, typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
