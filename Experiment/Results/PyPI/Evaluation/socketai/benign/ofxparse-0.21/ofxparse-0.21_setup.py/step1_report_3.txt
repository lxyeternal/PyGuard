  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the ofxparse Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from __init__.py, reading README file, and package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "Reading version from file -> package setup -> installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the package version from a source file and the README content, then prepares the setup parameters for packaging the library. There are no dynamic code executions, no network calls, and no use of untrusted input data. The use of regex to extract version is standard practice. The package metadata and dependencies are explicitly defined, and there is no indication of malicious intent. No obfuscated or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
