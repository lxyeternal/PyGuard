{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'ofxparse' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'ofxparse/__init__.py'; reads README file; defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or network operations.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from file -> uses in setup parameters; reads README -> provides long_description; no data flows from external input to vulnerable sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No obfuscated code or unusual runtime behaviors. No network communication, code injection, or data leakage detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package. It reads package version info from a file, reads a README file for description, and defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no network operations, no code that executes untrusted input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious file manipulations. The code is straightforward and typical of Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a normal setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or vulnerabilities. It solely facilitates package installation and distribution.",
