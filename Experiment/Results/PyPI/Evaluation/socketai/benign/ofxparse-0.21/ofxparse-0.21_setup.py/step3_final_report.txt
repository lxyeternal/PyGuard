{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script (`setup.py`) for packaging the `ofxparse` library, responsible for defining package metadata, reading version info, and configuring installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from `ofxparse/__init__.py` via regex, reads `README.rst` for long description, and static package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external input, or dynamic code execution occurs during runtime.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from local files (`__init__.py` and `README.rst`) into variables used in `setup()`; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard practices for package setup. The regex-based version extraction is common and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static package configuration without dynamic or external data processing. It does not execute untrusted code, connect to networks, or handle user input. The regex used for version extraction is a typical pattern. No obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior or security issues. The assigned scores accurately reflect its safe and static nature.",
