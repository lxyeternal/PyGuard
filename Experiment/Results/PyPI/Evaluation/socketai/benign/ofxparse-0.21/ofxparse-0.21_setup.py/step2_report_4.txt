  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code's behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior, no untrusted data handling, no code injection, or dynamic execution.\n- **Analysis:** The code reads version info from a local file, loads README, and calls `setup()` with static parameters. No network activity, no untrusted input processing, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** This is accurate. The code is typical for package setup, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the script reads version info and README, with no external input handling or suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** The only noteworthy aspect is reading version info via regex from a local file, which is common practice.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1 (slightly above zero, possibly considering minimal risk), Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The slight increase in security risk score (0.1) is acceptable, given that the script does not perform any harmful operations. The code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data processing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard setup script, no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** No network, no code injection, no untrusted input.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others; no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Reads version info and README from local files, uses standard setup procedures.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** Essentially zero; the only minor point is reading version info via regex, which is standard practice.\n- **Confidence levels:** Fully justified at 1, as all reports agree.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 at most, but generally 0, since the code is purely for package setup and contains no vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 (very minimal, just because it reads files, but not risky)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe setup script with no security issues or malicious intent.",
