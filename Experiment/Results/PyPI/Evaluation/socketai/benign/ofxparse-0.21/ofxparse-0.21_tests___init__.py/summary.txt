  "conclusion": "The code appears benign across all reports, with the exception of Report 4, which indicates potential obfuscation and dynamic code usage. The assigned malware scores are appropriate, with low overall security risks. Slight lowering of risk scores in benign reports could be considered, but current scores are justified. No evidence suggests active malicious behavior, and the assessments are consistent with the provided descriptions."
