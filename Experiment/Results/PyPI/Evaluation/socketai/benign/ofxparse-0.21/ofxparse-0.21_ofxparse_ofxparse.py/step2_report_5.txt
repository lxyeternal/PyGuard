  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential vulnerabilities, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The parser is a standard, well-structured OFX parser. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, given the parser handles untrusted data but no evident malicious intent.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a typical parser with no signs of malware or sabotage.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe, standard parsing with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Comments:** The analysis confirms the absence of malicious patterns and highlights responsible handling of untrusted data.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a comprehensive OFX parser with no malicious activity or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is consistent, emphasizing safe parsing and standard libraries.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The parser is standard, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Comments:** The analysis correctly notes that resource exhaustion could be a theoretical concern with crafted input, but this is common for parsers and not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, confirming no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Comments:** The analysis is consistent with the code's structure.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Uniformly 0.2, reflecting typical parser risks (e.g., resource exhaustion or malformed input handling), but no significant security threat.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — consistent with the reports, representing minimal inherent parser risks.\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign scores independently, I would agree with the reports' assessments. The code appears to be a standard, robust OFX parser with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe overall security posture of this code is low risk, assuming input validation is handled externally and no hidden malicious payloads are embedded.",
