  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, standard OFX parser with no malicious or obfuscated components. It handles untrusted input cautiously but does not exhibit any malicious behavior. The overall security risk is low, primarily associated with resource exhaustion potential, which is inherent to parsers but not malicious. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics."
