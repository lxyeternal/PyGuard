  "purpose": "Manage PTY interactions for Docker containers, including signal handling, stream multiplexing, and container control via Docker API.",
  "sources": "Signal handlers, Docker API calls (inspect_container, attach_socket, resize, exec_create, exec_start, exec_resize), user input streams (stdin, stdout, stderr).",
  "sinks": "Docker API functions, signal handling, I/O streams, socket connections.",
  "flows": "User/system input streams → signal handlers and Docker API calls → container streams (stdin, stdout, stderr) → multiplexed streams back to user.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious network activity. Use of deprecated warnings is noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard PTY management for Docker containers, including signal handling for window resize, stream multiplexing, and container control via Docker SDK. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or external communications are present. The code is well-structured, uses common modules, and handles signals and streams appropriately. The deprecation warnings are typical maintenance notices. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for managing Docker PTYs. No malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain attacks are evident. The low security risk score reflects typical PTY management complexity without malicious intent.",
