  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Manages PTY for Docker containers, signals, container info, user input.  \n- **Potential Sinks:** Docker API calls, signal functions, I/O streams.  \n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, standard signal handling, no obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate container PTY management, no malicious activity, malware score 0, risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar purpose and data sources.  \n- No malicious sinks or external communication, just standard Docker API usage and stream handling.  \n- No suspicious anomalies, no obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard, benign PTY management code. Malware 0, risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Focuses on signals, resizing, and stream management.  \n- Uses deprecated warnings but no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.  \n- No external network activity or malicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard Docker PTY handling, no malicious intent. Malware 0, risk 0.1, confidence 0.95.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Similar analysis, signal handling, socket data flow, no malicious patterns.  \n- Uses standard APIs, no suspicious external communication.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, benign code. Malware 0, risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Manages PTY, signals, streams, container info.  \n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.  \n- Minor note on deprecated warnings but not malicious.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard Docker PTY management, no malicious behavior. Malware 0, risk 0.1, confidence 0.9.  \n\n---\n\n### Critical Review & Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Presence & Functionality:** The code in question is a well-structured implementation of Docker PTY management, signal handling, and stream multiplexing. All reports describe consistent, legitimate use of Docker SDK APIs and standard Python modules.  \n- **Malicious Indicators:** No report indicates any malicious code, backdoors, external network exfiltration, or data leaks. The code does not contain obfuscated sections or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Use of Warnings & Deprecated Features:** All reports mention deprecation warnings related to parameters like 'logs'. This is a maintenance concern, not malicious.  \n- **External Communication & Data Flows:** All interactions are with Docker API or system signals, which are expected for such functionality. No external malicious communication is evident.  \n- **Scores & Justification:**  \n  - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.  \n  - **Risk:** Very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting typical PTY management risk, not a supply chain attack.  \n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code or activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and readable.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — standard PTY management, minimal security risk, no malicious intent.  \n\n**Note:** The overall scores are consistent across reports and justified by the detailed analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1            |\n\n**The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of Docker PTY management, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.**",
