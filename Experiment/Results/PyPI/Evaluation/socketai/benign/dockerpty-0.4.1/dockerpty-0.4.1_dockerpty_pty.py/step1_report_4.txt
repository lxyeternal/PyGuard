{
  "purpose": "The code implements PTY management and container interaction for Docker, handling signal trapping, stream management, and container execution/inspection.",
  "sources": "Reads signals (signal.signal), container info (client.inspect_container, client.exec_inspect), socket connections (client.attach_socket, client.exec_start), and process environment (sys.stdin, sys.stdout, sys.stderr).",
  "sinks": "Resizing container PTYs (client.resize, client.exec_resize), signal handling (signal.signal), and socket data streams (io.Stream, io.Demuxer).",
  "flows": "Signals (SIGWINCH) trigger resize; container info retrieval determines PTY mode; socket connections flow data between container and host; signal handlers manage terminal resizing.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated warnings for 'logs' parameter; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated or suspicious dynamic code; standard Docker interaction patterns; no external network connections or data exfiltration code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages terminal signals, stream I/O, and Docker container interactions, following standard practices. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious data handling observed. Signal handling and socket management appear legitimate. Use of warnings and dynamic socket handling is consistent with container management tools. No suspicious external communications, credential theft, or system damage routines identified. The code relies on external Docker APIs and standard Python modules for I/O and signals, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard implementation for managing Docker PTYs and container I/O, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses common patterns for signal handling, socket streaming, and container inspection. No malicious signals, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
