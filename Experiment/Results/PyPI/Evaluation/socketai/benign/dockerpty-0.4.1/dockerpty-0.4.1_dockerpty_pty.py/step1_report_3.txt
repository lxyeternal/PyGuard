{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python interface for managing pseudo-terminals (PTYs) for Docker containers, including signal handling, PTY resizing, and stream management for container I/O.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from the client, container info, and user terminal streams (stdin, stdout, stderr). It also reads signals such as SIGWINCH for terminal resizing.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to Docker container sockets, resizes terminal windows, and reads user input streams. It also writes to system streams (sys.stdout, sys.stderr).",
  "flows": "User input streams → Docker socket streams via io.Pump; Container output → user output streams; Signal handler triggers resize → Docker resize commands; Terminal resize requests → client.resize() calls.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated warnings for logs parameter; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures; all network or container interactions are standard API calls; no obfuscated code or malicious system access observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of a PTY management interface for Docker containers, handling signals, stream piping, and resizing. It uses Docker API methods to start containers, attach to sockets, and resize terminals. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. All external interactions are via documented Docker API calls. The signal handling is standard for terminal resize events, and stream management uses common patterns. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for Docker PTY management without malicious intent. It handles terminal signals, stream piping, and Docker interactions securely and appropriately. No indicators of malware or security risks were found.",
