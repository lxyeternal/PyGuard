  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the provided code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility classes and functions for stream management, including setting blocking modes, multiplexed stream demuxing, and piping data.\n- The code uses standard Python modules (os, fcntl, select, struct, errno, six) and typical system calls.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n- Exception handling appears standard, with recoverable errors managed appropriately.\n- No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system sabotage.\n- The code is consistent with typical Docker or terminal stream handling utilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Consistency\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or suspicious logic?**  \n  No. The code performs standard stream operations, multiplexing, and error handling.  \n- **Are the data flows reasonable?**  \n  Yes. Data flows from input streams to output streams via read/write, with multiplexing handled via headers.  \n- **Any anomalies or obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is clear, standard, and well-structured.\n\n### Scores Evaluation\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0. This aligns with the analysis; no malicious code is present.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.  \n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk in stream utilities.\n\n---\n\n### Specifics per report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Standard stream management for Docker-like environments.  \n- Confidence: 0.9  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar stream multiplexing and management.  \n- Confidence: 0.9  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Stream multiplexing, piping, and management.  \n- Confidence: 0.95  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Utility for stream multiplexing and management.  \n- Confidence: 0.9  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Similar stream utilities.  \n- Confidence: 0.9  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports — consistent with the code's behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports — code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk score:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1–0.2), which is appropriate for utility code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate (after thorough review):\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal inherent risk; the code is utility-focused and does not handle untrusted inputs directly.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is legitimate, standard stream management code with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the risk is minimal. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.",
