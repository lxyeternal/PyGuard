  "purpose": "Utility classes and functions for managing streams, multiplexing, and piping data in container or Docker environments.",
  "sources": "File descriptors, socket-like objects, streams with fileno(), recv(), send(), os.read(), os.write().",
  "sinks": "Untrusted streams or file descriptors where data is read from or written to; no external untrusted data explicitly handled.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input streams via read() or recv() to output streams via write() or send(), with multiplexing headers parsed to demux data chunks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard stream management, multiplexing, and piping utilities, with appropriate error handling and non-blocking configurations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The functions are consistent with typical container or terminal I/O handling. Exception handling is standard, and data flows are predictable and safe within their utility scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured utility code for stream handling, multiplexing, and piping, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
