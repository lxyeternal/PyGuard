{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for managing IO streams, including setting blocking modes, selecting ready streams, reading and writing data, demultiplexing Docker stream data, and piping data between streams.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from file descriptors via os.read(), recv(), and stream.read(). It also reads headers for demuxed Docker multiplexed streams.",
  "sinks": "Writes data to streams using os.write() and stream.write(). It also closes streams if requested.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source descriptors through reading functions, possibly through Demuxer or Pump classes, and then to output streams or buffers. Demuxer reads headers and payloads, Pump transfers data between streams.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or backdoors. Usage of standard library functions for IO and stream management appears normal. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. Error handling is standard. The code is structured for typical stream processing without suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a utility module for managing stream IO, including setting non-blocking modes, selecting streams for IO readiness, reading and writing data, demultiplexing Docker multiplexed streams, and piping data between streams. It employs standard practices such as error handling for recoverable errors, proper resource management (closing streams after pending data is sent), and well-documented functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access. All functions use safe, well-known methods, and no suspicious data flows or anomalies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for stream management with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated behavior. It appears to be part of a larger Docker or stream processing library, focusing solely on IO operations.",
