{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes to manage terminal (TTY) settings, including determining terminal size and toggling raw mode.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables ('LINES', 'COLUMNS') and uses file descriptors via fd.fileno() for terminal I/O control.",
  "sinks": "The code affects terminal device attributes through termios.tcgetattr and termios.tcsetattr, and reads environment variables. No untrusted output or network activity is present.",
  "flows": "The size() function reads terminal size via ioctl or environment variables; Terminal class's start() modifies terminal attributes, and stop() restores them.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a generic exception catch in size(), which may hide errors but is not inherently malicious. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. No network or data exfiltration is observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard terminal handling utility. The size() function attempts to get terminal dimensions either via ioctl or environment variables, with error handling. The Terminal class manages raw mode toggling using termios. The code follows typical patterns for terminal control without suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious network activity. The exception handling is broad but standard in such utility code, not indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical terminal utility library with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It manages terminal modes and size detection securely and transparently.",
