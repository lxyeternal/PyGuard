  "conclusion": "The code is a standard terminal utility module with no signs of malicious activity. The only issue is the incorrect buffer usage in the size() function, which should be fixed for correctness. Malware and obfuscation are not present. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the bug and broad exception handling, but these do not constitute security threats."
