  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'dockerpty' Python library, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; static strings for package info, dependencies, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs; no user input or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from filesystem ('README.md') into package setup configuration; no external or network data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code follows standard setup.py structure without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py file for a Python package, importing standard modules, defining a helper function to read files, and calling 'setup()' with package metadata. No user input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external network interactions are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for Python package distribution, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or suspicious operations.",
