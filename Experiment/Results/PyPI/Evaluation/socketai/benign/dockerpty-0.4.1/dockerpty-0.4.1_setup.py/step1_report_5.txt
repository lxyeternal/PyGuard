{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the dockerpty Python library, facilitating installation and dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description; reading the script file itself during execution.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network interaction occurs in this script.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply reads files and calls setup() with static arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations detected. The code is a standard setup script with no unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines helper functions to read files, and calls setuptools.setup() with static, hardcoded package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no use of untrusted input are present. The code's structure is typical for a Python package setup file. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. It performs typical package configuration without any indications of malware or security risks.",
