  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'dockerpty' Python library, defining package metadata and reading the README.md for long description.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long_description; static package metadata defined in setup()",
  "sinks": "The setup() function processes the metadata; no untrusted data or external sinks involved",
  "flows": "Reads static file 'README.md' into long_description; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution; straightforward setup script",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, benign setup.py script that reads a static README file and calls setup() with fixed metadata. No user input, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. All signals indicate a safe, standard packaging process. The scores assigned by all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected, and the code does not pose any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
