{
  "purpose": "To provide a wrapper interface for interacting with Docker containers via PTY, including starting containers and executing commands within them.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as client, container, command, and exec_id, which are used to initiate operations.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows lead to external or untrusted sources that could leak data or execute malicious actions outside container control.",
  "flows": "Inputs (client, container, command, exec_id) are used to create operations; these are then passed to PseudoTerminal.start() which manages PTY sessions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic. Usage of standard Docker API wrappers appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a straightforward wrapper for Docker PTY operations, constructing operation objects and invoking start methods. No external data is processed insecurely, no command injection or data leakage mechanisms are evident. Functions are simple and rely on imported modules for core functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign wrapper around Docker PTY interactions with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. It simply manages container execution sessions.",
