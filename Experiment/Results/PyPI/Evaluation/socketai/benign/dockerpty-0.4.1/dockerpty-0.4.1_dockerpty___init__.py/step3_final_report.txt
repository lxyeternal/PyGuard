  "purpose": "Wrapper functions for managing Docker container PTY sessions and executing commands via Docker API.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'client', 'container', 'command', 'exec_id', and I/O streams (stdout, stderr, stdin).",
  "sinks": "Execution of commands via Docker API; no external data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into Docker API calls; no external or untrusted data flows outside API usage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of wrapper functions around Docker's PTY and exec APIs, with no malicious logic, obfuscation, or data leaks. It relies on external inputs but does not process or transmit data maliciously. The functions serve legitimate container management purposes. No signs of malware, suspicious behavior, or security flaws are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard wrapper for Docker container interaction functions. It does not contain malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is appropriate, and malware score is 0.",
