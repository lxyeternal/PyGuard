{
  "purpose": "Provide wrappers for starting and executing commands inside Docker containers via PTY interfaces.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as client, container, command, exec_id, and I/O streams (stdout, stderr, stdin).",
  "sinks": "Use of client API calls for container interaction and execution, which could potentially be exploited if inputs are untrusted, but these are standard API wrappers.",
  "flows": "Inputs (client, container, command, exec_id) flow into Docker API calls to create and start PTY sessions and execute commands.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic detected. The code is straightforward wrappers around Docker API operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions that act as wrappers to control Docker container PTY sessions and command executions. It relies on external Docker API functions, passing user-provided parameters such as commands and execution IDs. No input validation, sanitization, or suspicious behavior is present. There are no network transmissions, data exfiltration, or malicious code indications. The functions are standard and do not perform any dangerous or malicious actions by themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a straightforward API wrapper for Docker PTY operations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain backdoors or obfuscated code.",
