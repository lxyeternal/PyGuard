{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to interact with Docker containers via pseudo-terminals, enabling starting containers, executing commands, and attaching to containers interactively.",
  "sources": "Input parameters include 'client', 'container', 'command', 'exec_id', and optional I/O streams (stdout, stderr, stdin), which are provided by the user or calling environment.",
  "targets": "The code executes Docker API calls and starts pseudo-terminals; it does not handle or transmit untrusted data to external systems or networks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (client, container, command, exec_id, I/O streams) flow into Docker API functions and object initializations, leading to terminal sessions; no external data flow or network transmission is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code simply wraps existing Docker API operations for terminal management.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward wrapper functions around Docker's pseudo-terminal and execution APIs, with clear parameter passing and no evidence of data leaks, malicious commands, or malicious behavior. It relies on the Docker client library and does not process or transmit data outside of expected container management tasks. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious modifications. The functions serve legitimate container interaction purposes without suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, legitimate wrapper for Docker container terminal interactions. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and aligned with intended container management functions.",
