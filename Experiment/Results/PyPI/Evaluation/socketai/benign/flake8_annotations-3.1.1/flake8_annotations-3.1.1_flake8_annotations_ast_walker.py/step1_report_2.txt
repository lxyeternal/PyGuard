{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to analyze Python source code's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for function and argument metadata, including annotations, decorators, and context such as nested functions or class methods. It appears to support static code analysis for type annotations and function structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads input source code as text lines for locating function definition positions and processes AST nodes such as function definitions, class definitions, return statements, and arguments.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in the code. The code does not perform data writes, network communications, or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code constructs function and argument representations from AST nodes, processes decorators, and tracks context for nested functions and class methods. It does not transfer data outside its scope but relies on the input source code lines and AST nodes to build internal metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to be a typical static analysis utility with thorough handling of Python AST structures. No obfuscation or hidden malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules for AST parsing and type annotations, then defines classes to model function arguments and functions with their metadata. It includes methods for extracting annotations, decorator types, and function context (nested or class method). The AST visitors traverse source code ASTs to identify functions, their decorators, arguments, and return types. The logic for handling function definitions, nested functions, class methods, and annotations appears conventional and aligns with static analysis practices. There are no patterns indicating code injection, malicious data exfiltration, or system compromise. The code is well-structured for its purpose and does not perform any unsafe operations or external communication.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard static analysis tool component for parsing and extracting metadata from Python source code. It does not exhibit any malicious intent, backdoors, or harmful behaviors. Its purpose is to facilitate code quality, style, or type annotation checks without executing or manipulating untrusted data. Therefore, it poses no security threat and is safe for use.",
