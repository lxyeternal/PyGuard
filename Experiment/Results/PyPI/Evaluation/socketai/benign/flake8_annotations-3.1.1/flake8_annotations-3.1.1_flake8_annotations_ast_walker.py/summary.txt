  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured static analysis tool with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It operates solely on AST and source lines for introspection, making it safe for use. The previous low malware and risk scores are appropriate, but given the absence of any malicious behavior, the malware score should be set to 0."
