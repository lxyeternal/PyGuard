{
  "purpose": "The code provides static analysis of Python source code by parsing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to extract function and argument metadata, including annotations, decorators, and context such as nested functions and class methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads source lines for locating function definitions and their end positions, and processes AST nodes representing functions, arguments, decorators, and return annotations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects; the code solely processes AST nodes and source lines internally without external data handling.",
  "flows": "Source data (source lines and AST nodes) flow into Argument and Function object creation, with internal methods analyzing decorators, annotations, and context, culminating in metadata extraction without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present; the code is straightforward and well-structured for static analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static analysis utility that constructs representations of functions and arguments from AST nodes, handling decorators, annotations, nested functions, and class methods. It reads source lines to determine function boundaries and uses visitor patterns to analyze return statements. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is involved. The code does not perform any unsafe operations or contain obfuscated constructs. Its purpose is solely introspective, extracting metadata for analysis purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured static analysis tool with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It operates solely on AST and source lines for introspection, making it safe for use. The previous low malware and risk scores are appropriate, but given the absence of any malicious behavior, the malware score should be set to 0.",
