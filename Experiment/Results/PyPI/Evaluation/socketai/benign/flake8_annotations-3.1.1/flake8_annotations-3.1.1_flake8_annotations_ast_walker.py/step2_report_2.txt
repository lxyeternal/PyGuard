  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a static analysis utility for Python ASTs, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The code performs AST parsing, metadata extraction, and static analysis of functions, arguments, decorators, and annotations.\n   - No report indicates any code that performs dynamic execution, network operations, file manipulations, or other suspicious activities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying the purpose and operations of the code.\n   - They do not overstate or understate the security implications.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the static, non-executing nature of the code.\n   - `obfuscated` scores are 0, aligning with the clear, readable structure.\n   - `securityRisk` scores are very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The overall risk scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.1, which is appropriate.\n   - The code is purely static analysis; no reason exists to assign higher risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - Since the code does not perform any malicious actions, execute untrusted code, or contain hidden payloads, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid speculative claims; they correctly interpret the code's static nature.\n   - No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard static analysis utility for Python ASTs, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It only reads and processes source code for metadata extraction, which is a common and safe operation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports collectively confirm that the code is safe, well-structured, and intended for static code analysis. No malicious or suspicious elements are present. Therefore, the scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n- No further action needed.",
