  "purpose": "A flake8 plugin for linting Python type hint annotations in function definitions, including configuration options for customizing the checks.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration options, parsing input lines, parsing AST of the source code, and inspecting function definitions and decorators.",
  "sinks": "Error classification functions and the `yield` statements that output linting errors; no data is sent over the network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Source inputs from configuration, input lines, and AST parsing flow into analysis of function annotations and decorators, then into error classification and output via `yield`.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors such as obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or backdoors. Usage of `lru_cache()` for classification functions is standard. No hardcoded credentials or malicious data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis of Python source code for type hint correctness, using AST parsing and decorator checks. It includes options for suppression, configuration, and classification of errors. No code indicates malicious intent or malicious payloads. The only notable aspect is extensive use of configuration options, which are typical for linters and do not present security risks. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured plugin for static code analysis, with no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate static analysis plugin for Python type annotations, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs code linting tasks based on static source code analysis and configuration options.",
