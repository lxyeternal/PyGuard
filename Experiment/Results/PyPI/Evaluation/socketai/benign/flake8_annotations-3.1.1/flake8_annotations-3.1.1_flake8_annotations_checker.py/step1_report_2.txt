  "purpose": "A Python flake8 plugin for checking presence and correctness of type hints in function definitions, with configurable options.",
  "sources": "Input lines (`lines` parameter), parsed AST (`self.tree`), decorator lists (`self.dispatch_decorators`, `self.overload_decorators`), and configuration options from flake8.",
  "sinks": "Error reporting via `yield` of error objects converted to flake8 format, no direct data sinks, no external network or file operations observed.",
  "flows": "Input lines -> parsing into AST -> visiting function definitions -> classification of errors -> yielding error reports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded credentials, network access, file manipulation, or obfuscated logic are present. The code primarily deals with static code analysis and configuration handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static code analysis plugin for flake8, designed to enforce type hinting standards. It parses source code, applies configurable rules, and reports errors related to missing or incorrect type annotations. No external data flow, network access, or system manipulation code is present. It uses caching for classification functions and defines multiple configuration options for behavior customization. The core logic involves parsing, visiting AST nodes, and classifying errors, all of which are typical for a static analysis tool. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or unintended side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate static analysis plugin for Python, focused on type hint validation. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. Its design and implementation are consistent with standard static code analysis tools, and no suspicious or malicious activity is evident.",
