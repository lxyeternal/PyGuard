{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of classes for reporting type annotation errors and warnings in Python code, intended for use with Flake8 linting tool.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function arguments, function definitions, and error message formatting methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data affects sensitive operations, such as network, filesystem, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input Argument and Function objects into error objects, which generate formatted error messages for Flake8.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code primarily consists of class definitions and message formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining error classes with associated messages for missing type annotations and related warnings. It uses standard class inheritance, method overriding, and formatting techniques. No code injection, network operations, or obfuscated code are present. The structure and logic appear normal and intended solely for static analysis reporting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing on error reporting for type annotations. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks identified. The code's purpose is purely to support a linter plugin with no indications of malicious intent.",
