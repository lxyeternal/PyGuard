  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and intended for static analysis error reporting related to Python type annotations. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature."
