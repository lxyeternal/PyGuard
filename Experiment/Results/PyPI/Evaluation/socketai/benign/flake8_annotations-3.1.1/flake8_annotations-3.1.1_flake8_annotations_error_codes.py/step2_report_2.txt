  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Code**  \n   All reports consistently indicate that the code is purely structural, defining classes for error reporting in a static analysis context. There are no indications of code injection, dynamic execution, network activity, or any other malicious behavior. The code solely handles message formatting and error metadata.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \n   The code appears well-structured and logically consistent. The class inheritance, method overriding, and message formatting follow standard patterns. No logical flaws or anomalies are evident.\n\n3. **Score Justification and Reasonableness**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign a risk score of 0, aligning with the absence of security concerns.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Potential Assumptions and Claims**  \n   The reports do not rely on assumptions about vulnerabilities; they simply analyze the code's behavior and structure. Their conclusion that the code is benign and intended solely for static analysis is well-supported.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores with Content**  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and match the actual content and purpose of the code.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**  \n   Since the code is part of a static analysis tool, it doesn't process untrusted data or perform operations that could be exploited or malicious. The design is straightforward, with no hidden or obfuscated logic.\n\n**Final Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)  \n\n**Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and purely intended for static analysis error reporting.**",
