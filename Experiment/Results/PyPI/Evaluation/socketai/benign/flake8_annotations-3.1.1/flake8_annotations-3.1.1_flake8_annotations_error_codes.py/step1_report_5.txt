{
  "purpose": "Define classes for representing and formatting linting errors related to Python type annotations, particularly for use with the Flake8 static analysis tool.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules (flake8_annotations, typing, etc.) and class instantiations based on code analysis.",
  "sinks": "Error message formatting and class instantiation are the main sinks; no untrusted data input or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Error object creation from code analysis metadata (Argument, Function) flows into error message formatting for Flake8 output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code mainly defines data structures and message formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class definitions for various error types related to missing or disallowed type annotations. It uses class inheritance and formatting methods to generate standardized error messages for static analysis. The code imports external modules and defines no execution logic or external data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, file operations, or obfuscated code, are detected. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for linting error representation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of error classes for a static analysis tool, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It solely defines data structures and formatting methods for linting error reporting.",
