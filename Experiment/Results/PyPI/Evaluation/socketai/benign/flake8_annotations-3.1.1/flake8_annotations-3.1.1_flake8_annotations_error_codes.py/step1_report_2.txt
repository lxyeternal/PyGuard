{
  "purpose": "Define custom error classes for Python type hinting and annotation linting rules, to be used with Flake8 for static analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'flake8_annotations' modules, class attribute definitions, and method implementations within error classes.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains external data outputs, network operations, or data sinks that could leak or exfiltrate data.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only defines classes and methods for error reporting; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class definitions with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. It is purely structural, defining error types for static analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules related to static code analysis ('flake8_annotations') and defines several error classes for various types of missing annotations. Each class encapsulates specific linting rules and provides methods to format error messages for Flake8. The class structures follow standard patterns with no suspicious behavior, no external data handling, and no side effects. The code does not perform any network activity, file I/O, or dynamic execution. The content appears purely to facilitate static analysis error reporting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of class definitions used for static code linting of type annotations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code is well-structured and intended solely for static analysis purposes.",
