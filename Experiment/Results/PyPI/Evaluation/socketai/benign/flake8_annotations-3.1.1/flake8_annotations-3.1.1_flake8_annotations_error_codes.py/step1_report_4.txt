{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for linting and error reporting related to Python type annotations, intended for use in static analysis tools like Flake8.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data, class and method definitions, and error message templates.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; the code only formats and returns error objects.",
  "flows": "Error objects are instantiated with metadata and formatted for Flake8 output, but there are no external data flows or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and adheres to standard static analysis patterns. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or malicious logic, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to report missing type annotations in Python functions, methods, and arguments, including specific error classes with formatted messages. It relies on static data and class attributes, with no dynamic code execution, input/output operations, or external interactions. The structure and content suggest it is a part of a larger static analysis tool or plugin focused on code quality, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code. It appears to be a benign, well-structured utility for static code analysis related to type annotations.",
