  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - The original code `__version__ = \"3.1.1\"` is a standard practice in Python packages for versioning.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Anomalies**:\n   - No report indicates any suspicious logic, external data handling, or code that could be malicious.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for package version declarations.\n\n3. **Obfuscation & Malware Scores**:\n   - All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is accurate.\n   - Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature. There is no indication of malicious activity.\n\n4. **Security Risk Scores**:\n   - All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Scores Justification & Consistency**:\n   - The high confidence scores (mostly 1 or 1.0) are justified, as the code is standard and contains no suspicious elements.\n   - The consistency across reports confirms the benign assessment.\n\n6. **Any Claims Based on Assumptions?**:\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all recognize the code as a simple version declaration.\n\n7. **Potential for Improvement**:\n   - Given the simplicity, no adjustments to scores are necessary.\n   - The scores reflect the actual analysis accurately.\n\n**Final Evaluation**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a standard, harmless version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- I agree with the current scores. No changes needed.\n- The code is benign, with zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that this is a typical version declaration in a Python package.",
