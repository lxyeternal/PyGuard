  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable for package versioning.",
  "sources": "No external sources; the code is a direct assignment of a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is a static assignment with no input or output pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a version string, a common pattern in Python packages. It contains no input/output, external dependencies, or malicious logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. There are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors to consider.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All assessments and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
