{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define the version number of a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The source is the assignment of the __version__ variable, which is typically set at the module level.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations beyond variable assignment.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is necessary since this is a simple assignment statement with no input or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a version string assignment with no additional logic; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version identifier for the package or module, a common practice for version tracking. No external input, data processing, or suspicious behavior is involved. The minimal nature of the code indicates it is benign and typical for package versioning.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version declaration with no malicious behavior, no suspicious logic, and no security concerns.",
