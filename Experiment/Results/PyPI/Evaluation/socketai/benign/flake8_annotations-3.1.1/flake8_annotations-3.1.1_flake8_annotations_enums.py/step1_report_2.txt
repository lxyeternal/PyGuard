  "purpose": "Define enums for categorizing function types, class decorators, and annotation types in Python.",
  "sources": "Import statement for Enum and auto from enum module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not handle untrusted input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscated patterns. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard library modules, then defines three Enum classes to categorize different Python language constructs. The code includes docstrings explaining the purpose of each enum class, with no dynamic or reflective code, no input handling, and no network or system operations. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious behavior, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard definition of enum classes for categorizing function and class decorator types in Python. No malicious intent or security risks are identified.",
