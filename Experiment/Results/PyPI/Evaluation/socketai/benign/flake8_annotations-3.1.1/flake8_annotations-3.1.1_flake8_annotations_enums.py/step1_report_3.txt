  "purpose": "Define enums for categorizing Python function types, class decorators, and annotation types.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'enum' module import and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or output; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, external calls, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines three Enum classes: FunctionType, ClassDecoratorType, and AnnotationType. These are static definitions for categorization purposes. No user input, external data, or runtime behaviors are present. The code uses standard Python 'enum' features, including auto() for automatic enumeration values. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious side effects. The structure and content are straightforward and typical for such definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard set of Enum class definitions with no signs of malicious or maliciously disguised behavior. It poses no security risk.",
