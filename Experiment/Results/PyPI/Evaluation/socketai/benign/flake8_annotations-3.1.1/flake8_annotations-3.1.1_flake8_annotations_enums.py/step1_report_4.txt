  "purpose": "Define enumerations for function types, class decorators, and annotation types in Python.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; the code defines classes and enums.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or output operations are performed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative with class and enum definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of enum class definitions using the Python enum module. It provides labeled categories for functions, class decorators, and annotations. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, and no dynamic code execution. The code appears to be purely for code analysis or documentation purposes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, well-structured set of enum definitions with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
