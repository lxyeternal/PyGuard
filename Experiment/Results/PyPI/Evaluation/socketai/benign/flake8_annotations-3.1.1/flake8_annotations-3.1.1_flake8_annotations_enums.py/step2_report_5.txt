  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is static, consists solely of enum class definitions, and lacks any dynamic, input/output, or network operations.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- The purpose appears to be for categorization or static analysis support.\n- Confidence is high (1) across all reports.\n- Malware score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- Security risk is also 0, which is consistent.\n\n**Confirming the code:**\n- The code defines three enum classes: `FunctionType`, `ClassDecoratorType`, and `AnnotationType`.\n- These classes categorize function types, class decorators, and annotation types, respectively.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, or malicious behavior is present.\n- The code uses standard Python enum practices.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The code is straightforward and correctly implemented.\n- No issues in the reasoning or summary.\n\n**Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- The purpose and analysis are accurate.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- Since the code is purely static enum definitions, there's no basis for any higher risk scores.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and has no malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign set of enum definitions for categorizing Python language constructs. All evidence points to a safe, standard, and well-structured implementation with no security concerns.",
