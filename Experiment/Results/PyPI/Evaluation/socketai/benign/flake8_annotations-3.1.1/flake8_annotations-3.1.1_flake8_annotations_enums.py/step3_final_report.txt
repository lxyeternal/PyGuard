  "purpose": "Define categorization enums for Python function types, class decorators, and annotation types to support static analysis or documentation.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static enum class definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process external input or perform data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static definitions serve as categorization constants.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three enum classes: FunctionType, ClassDecoratorType, and AnnotationType, each serving as categorization tools. There are no dynamic behaviors, input handling, network operations, or code execution. The code uses standard Python enum practices with clear docstrings. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The code's purpose is purely definitional, supporting static analysis or documentation, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of enum definitions for categorizing Python function types, class decorators, and annotations. It poses no security threat or malicious intent. All reports' assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
