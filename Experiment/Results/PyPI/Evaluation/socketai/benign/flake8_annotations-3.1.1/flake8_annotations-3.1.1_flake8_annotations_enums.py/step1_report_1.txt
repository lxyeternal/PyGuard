  "purpose": "Define enumerations for function types, class decorator types, and annotation types in Python code.",
  "sources": "No input data sources present in the code; the code is static definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or output; purely static enum definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for Enums that categorize function types, class decorators, and annotation types. It uses standard Python features such as Enum and auto() for value assignment. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or network operations. The purpose appears to be to support static analysis or documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, benign enumeration definitions with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is straightforward and consistent with typical Python coding practices.",
