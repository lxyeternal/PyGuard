  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static enum class definitions.\n- No input, output, network, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code uses standard Python enum practices with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Confirming issues:**\n- The code matches the descriptions: static, benign enum definitions.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the code logic or reasoning.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- Since the code is purely static enum definitions, assigning any non-zero malware or security risk scores would be unjustified.\n- The purpose appears to be for categorization or static analysis support, not runtime behavior.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n- The code poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign and straightforward nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign set of enum definitions with no security issues or malicious intent. The reports correctly identify this, and the scoring reflects the actual risk level.",
