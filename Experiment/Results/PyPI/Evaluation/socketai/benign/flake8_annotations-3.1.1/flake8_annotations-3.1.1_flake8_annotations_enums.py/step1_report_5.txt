  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths evident in the code",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard enum definitions using Python's Enum and auto(). There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no data leaks. The purpose is clearly to categorize code elements related to Python functions, class decorators, and annotations. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward enum definitions for categorization purposes with no malicious intent or security issues.",
