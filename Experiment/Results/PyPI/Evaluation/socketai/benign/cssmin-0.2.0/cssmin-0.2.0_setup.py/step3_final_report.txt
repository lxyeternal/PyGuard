  "purpose": "Define package metadata and CLI entry point for the cssmin module.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields in setup(), including name, version, author, url, description, modules, and entry_points.",
  "sinks": "The entry point 'cssmin = cssmin:main' could invoke external code, but this setup script itself does not execute or process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration declares an entry point that, when invoked, executes the main() function in the cssmin module; no data flows are present in this script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward setup script with static configuration data.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, no input handling, and no obfuscation. The only dynamic aspect is the CLI entry point referencing cssmin:main, which is typical for CLI tools. The script does not perform any network activity, data processing, or code execution beyond static configuration. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. There are no suspicious or malicious elements in this code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard Python packaging configuration with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
