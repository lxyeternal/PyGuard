  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'cssmin' Python module and its command-line interface.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations; all static configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only defines metadata and setup instructions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static configuration without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard setuptools setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, modules, and entry points. It imports only the 'setup' function, which is used to specify package information such as name, version, author details, URL, description, module list, package directory, and console script entry point. There are no dynamic or potentially malicious operations. No external inputs are read, and no suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign and typical setup configuration script for a Python package. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
