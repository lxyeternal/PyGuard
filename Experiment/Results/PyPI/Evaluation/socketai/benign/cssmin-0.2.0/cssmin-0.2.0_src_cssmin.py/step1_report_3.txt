  "purpose": "The code is designed to minify CSS by removing comments, unnecessary whitespace, and performing various optimizations to reduce file size.",
  "sources": "Input CSS data read from standard input (sys.stdin.read()).",
  "sinks": "Output CSS data written to standard output (sys.stdout.write).",
  "flows": "Input CSS data -> processed through various removal and condensing functions -> output CSS data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No use of network, file system, or environment variables for malicious purposes. The code solely processes CSS data.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a CSS minifier, utilizing regex-based transformations and string manipulations to optimize CSS code. It includes functions for removing comments, unnecessary whitespace, and condensing colors and units. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system manipulation are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with standard CSS minification practices. The script reads input from stdin and writes to stdout, which is typical for command-line tools and poses no security concerns. No obfuscated code, hidden logic, or malicious patterns were identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CSS minification utility with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs purely cosmetic and size-reduction transformations on CSS data. Therefore, it poses no security threat based on the provided code.",
