  "purpose": "This script minifies CSS by removing comments, whitespace, and condensing color and unit representations.",
  "sources": "Reads CSS input from stdin, processes through various string manipulation functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs minified CSS to stdout; no other data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Reads CSS from stdin -> processes through multiple regex and string replacements -> outputs minified CSS to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs CSS minification with functions removing comments, whitespace, unnecessary semicolons, empty rules, and converting color formats. It uses regex for pattern matching and string replacements to condense code, but all operations are contained within straightforward string manipulations. There are no sources of external input other than stdin and no data being sent elsewhere. The code is well-structured for its purpose and contains no indications of malicious behavior or malware. No obfuscation or malicious anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CSS minifier with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely manipulates CSS strings for compression, with no network or system access involved.",
