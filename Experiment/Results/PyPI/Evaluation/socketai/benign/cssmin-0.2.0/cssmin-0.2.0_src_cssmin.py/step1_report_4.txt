  "purpose": "The code is a CSS minifier that removes comments, unnecessary whitespace, converts colors, condenses zeros, and formats CSS for compression.",
  "sources": "Reads CSS input from stdin using sys.stdin.read().",
  "sinks": "Outputs compressed CSS to stdout via sys.stdout.write().",
  "flows": "Input CSS from stdin -> processing functions (removing comments, whitespace, etc.) -> output CSS to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns found. No network activity, no external data access, or code that performs system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script performs CSS minification by applying various regex-based transformations and string replacements. It carefully preserves comments like /*!...*/ and handles CSS syntax to avoid malformed output. It does not execute external code, access environment variables, or perform any network operations. No obfuscation techniques or malicious patterns are evident. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and typical for a minification utility. No signs of malware or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CSS minifier with no malicious behavior detected. It safely processes CSS input for compression purposes and outputs the result without side effects. No security risks or malware indications are identified.",
