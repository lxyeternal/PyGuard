  "purpose": "A CSS minification utility that removes comments, whitespace, condenses colors and zeros, and formats CSS for size reduction.",
  "sources": "Reads CSS input from stdin, processes string data within functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs minified CSS to stdout; no untrusted data sinks or external data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Input CSS data flows through various string manipulation functions, regex replacements, and formatting steps, ultimately leading to output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CSS minifier performing string operations, regex substitutions, and formatting. It does not perform network activity, system modifications, or contain obfuscated code. The functions are solely for CSS string processing. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The import fallback for StringIO is standard compatibility code. The logic is clear, and the code's purpose is transparent. All signals indicate benign behavior with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard CSS minifier with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high security risk and malware scores are conservative, reflecting supply chain concerns, but the actual code behavior is safe and straightforward.",
