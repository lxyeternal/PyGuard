{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to minify CSS files by removing comments, unnecessary whitespace, and optimizing color and size representations.",
  "sources": "Reads CSS input from standard input (sys.stdin.read()). No external or untrusted data sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the minified CSS to standard output (sys.stdout.write()). No direct data leaks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input from stdin flows through various string manipulation functions (removing comments, whitespace, compressing colors, etc.) and finally is written to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code only performs CSS minification using regex replacements and string operations. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or code injection techniques are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CSS minifier that uses regex-based transformations to optimize CSS code. It handles removal of comments, whitespace, unnecessary semicolons, zero units, color conversions, and line wrapping. There are no signs of malicious activity, external data handling, or obfuscated code. The initial import attempts account for different Python versions but do not perform any malicious actions. The script is intended to be used as a command-line tool, reading CSS from stdin and writing to stdout, with no network or file system malicious interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CSS minification utility with no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It performs standard text processing tasks without external data or harmful side effects.",
