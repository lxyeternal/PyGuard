  "purpose": "The code is designed to minify CSS files by removing comments, whitespace, unnecessary semicolons, and optimizing color and spacing representations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input CSS data from standard input (sys.stdin.read()).",
  "sinks": "The code writes the processed CSS output to standard output (sys.stdout).",
  "flows": "Input CSS data is read from stdin, processed through multiple functions to remove comments, whitespace, and optimize CSS, then output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration present. Usage of regex is straightforward and related solely to CSS processing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a CSS minifier that removes comments, whitespace, and performs CSS optimizations. It imports standard modules with fallback handling for StringIO, uses regex for pattern matching, and processes CSS data entirely in-memory. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network connections, data theft, or backdoors. The functions focus solely on string manipulation for CSS compression. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious imports are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward CSS minification tool with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. The code performs solely CSS processing tasks without any hidden or harmful behaviors.",
