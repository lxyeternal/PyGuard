  "purpose": "This code provides logging configuration and utility functions for the Pymodbus library, including setting log levels, formatting messages, and logging messages at various levels.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function parameters such as 'level' and 'log_file_name' for configuration, and the arguments to logging functions for message content. No external or untrusted input reading is present.",
  "sinks": "Logging output to console (StreamHandler) and optional file (FileHandler). No untrusted data is written to external systems beyond local logs.",
  "flows": "Configuration functions process parameters to set up log handlers and levels; message-building functions format messages based on provided arguments; logging functions output formatted messages to handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. The code employs standard logging practices and message formatting. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logging setup with options for console and file outputs. It includes a message formatter that handles special tags like ':hex', ':str', and ':b2a', converting data accordingly. The logging functions simply log messages at various levels after formatting. All operations are standard and focused on local logging setup and message formatting. No signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging utility with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It facilitates configurable logging for the Pymodbus library without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
