{
  "purpose": "Defines classes and methods for handling Modbus event bytes, encoding and decoding various remote event types.",
  "sources": "The encode methods generate event byte messages; decode methods read event bytes passed as parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are present; the code processes internal event representations.",
  "flows": "Input event bytes to decode methods, output encoded event bytes from encode methods, internal state updates during decode.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard bit manipulations for event handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Modbus event handling with encoding/decoding functions, defining classes for different event types. It uses established methods like pack_bitstring and unpack_bitstring, with no external network or file operations, no data leaks, and no suspicious data handling. The decode methods for specific events verify input bytes against expected fixed values, raising exceptions on mismatch, which is a normal validation pattern. Overall, the code appears as standard protocol handling code without malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely handles Modbus event byte encoding/decoding with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious data processing. It does not contain any backdoors, suspicious network activity, or harmful instructions. It appears to be a legitimate protocol implementation.",
