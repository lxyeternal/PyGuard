{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for Modbus remote event types, encoding/decoding event status bits for communication logs.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data directly; data is processed via method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Data encoding/decoding functions (pack_bitstring, unpack_bitstring) could manipulate bits but are standard for Modbus protocol.",
  "flows": "Event objects encode internal state into bytes and decode bytes back into internal state; no external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The encode/decode methods are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several classes for representing Modbus events with methods to encode/decode event bits. It uses standard library functions for bit packing/unpacking, with no external data inputs, network operations, or system modifications. Exception handling is limited to validation of specific byte values. No malicious or sabotage behavior is evident. The code's purpose appears to be protocol data handling, not executing any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Modbus event handling with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions to encode and decode event bits for Modbus communication without external data processing or system impact.",
