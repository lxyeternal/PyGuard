  "purpose": "Defines classes for Modbus remote event handling, including encoding and decoding event bytes for various event types.",
  "sources": "None evident; the code processes event data provided to encode/decode methods, and internal class constants.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is sent to external systems or network, only internal data processing and encoding.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input event bytes to decode methods, updating class instance attributes, and from attributes to encode methods producing event bytes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of static class variables for encoded bytes; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious constants; straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a set of classes representing different Modbus remote events, with methods to encode and decode event bytes using bit manipulation. No external data sources, user inputs, or network interactions are present. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The only potential concern is the use of static encoded values for certain events, which is standard in protocol implementations, not malicious. The decode methods validate specific byte values and raise exceptions if mismatched, following expected protocol validation. Overall, the code appears to be standard, protocol-compliant, and free from malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of Modbus event classes with encode/decode functionalities, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a straightforward protocol handling module without external data flow or malicious payloads.",
