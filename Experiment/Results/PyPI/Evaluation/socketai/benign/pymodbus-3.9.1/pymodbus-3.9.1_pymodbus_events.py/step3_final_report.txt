{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for Modbus event bytes with encoding and decoding methods, handling specific event types with validation.",
  "sources": "Internal class attributes and functions pack_bitstring, unpack_bitstring for bit manipulation",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or sinks; purely internal data processing",
  "flows": "Class attributes set during initialization, encoding methods produce byte packets, decode methods interpret byte data to update attributes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation, no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard protocol data handling for Modbus events, with validation checks that raise exceptions on invalid data. It uses established functions for bit packing/unpacking, and the classes serve to encode/decode event bytes with clear, well-defined logic. No external interactions, network activity, or malicious code are present. The validation of fixed byte values in decode methods is typical for protocol compliance. Overall, the code is clean, well-structured, and free of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of Modbus event encoding/decoding, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are accurate and justified.",
