  "purpose": "Utilities for building and decoding Modbus message payloads, including serialization and deserialization of various data types with endianness handling.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from payload buffers, register lists, and coil lists; accessing class attributes for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows primarily within internal methods for packing/unpacking data; no external sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (payload, registers, coils) through encoding/decoding functions, with internal handling of byte order and data conversion.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated methods (deprecate()), verbose logging, and comments indicating planned removal; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of binary data handling for Modbus protocol, utilizing standard Python modules (struct, array) and external constants. It performs data packing and unpacking with configurable endianness, includes deprecation warnings for future removal, and contains verbose debug logs. No network activity, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns are present. The logic is clear, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The deprecated methods and verbose logs are maintenance concerns, not security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for Modbus payload processing, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent and appropriate given the code's purpose and structure.",
