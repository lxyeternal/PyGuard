{
  "purpose": "Provides utilities for building and decoding Modbus message payloads, facilitating communication with Modbus devices.",
  "sources": "Class methods that read or process payload data (e.g., __init__, fromRegisters, fromCoils, decode_* methods, bit_chunks).",
  "sinks": "Methods that assemble or interpret payload data (e.g., encode, build, add_bits, add_* methods, to_registers, to_coils).",
  "flows": "Sources (payload input or register data) flow through methods like build or decode_* to produce modified payloads or decoded values.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains deprecated warnings but no signs of malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or suspicious external calls are present. Use of logging is standard for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility for Modbus payload handling, mainly performing data packing and unpacking with endianness considerations. It employs standard Python modules like struct and array, and relies on external pymodbus constants and exceptions. No external or network interactions occur, and no obfuscated or dynamically executed code is present. The use of deprecated warnings indicates maintenance notes but no malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The functions are consistent with their purpose, securely handling binary data transformations. Overall, the code appears well-structured, standard, and free of malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility module for Modbus payload processing with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs data serialization and deserialization securely and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
