  "purpose": "Implementing Modbus Socket frame encoding and decoding for communication.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include the 'data' parameter in decode() and 'pdu', 'device_id', 'tid' in encode(). These are either external data streams or constructed data for message framing.",
  "sinks": "Decoded data (tid, device_id, etc.) could be used elsewhere; encoded frame output is sent over network. No direct data leaks or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into decode(), parsed into identifiers and payload. encode() constructs frame data from parameters for transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data exfiltration present. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a standard Modbus protocol framing mechanism. The decode() method processes incoming byte streams to extract message components, with checks for frame length and validity. The encode() method constructs frames for transmission based on provided parameters. No malicious behavior such as data leakage, system modification, or hidden network activity is observed. Use of logging is limited to debug messages. Overall, the implementation aligns with standard protocol framing without suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of Modbus frame encoding and decoding, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected protocol operations without secretive or harmful functions.",
