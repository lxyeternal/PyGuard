  "purpose": "Implementation of Modbus socket framing for encoding and decoding ADUs.",
  "sources": "Input data in the decode() method, particularly the 'data' bytes parameter.",
  "sinks": "Return of decoded data; encoding of frames in encode() method.",
  "flows": "decode() reads data from input bytes; encode() generates a frame from provided parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated code present. Use of logging for debugging, but no sensitive info leaks apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard framing operations for Modbus communication, decoding and encoding data packets with proper length checks. The decode() method handles incoming byte streams, verifies lengths, and extracts fields. The encode() method constructs frames with provided device IDs, transaction IDs, and PDU payloads. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The logging calls are for debugging purposes only, not indicative of malicious intent. No external data sources, network communications, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of Modbus socket framing with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It performs standard data handling tasks typical for such protocols without any evidence of sabotage, malware, or security risks.",
