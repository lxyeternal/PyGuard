  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Modbus protocol error handling.",
  "sources": "Code reads input parameters for exception messages and class inheritance.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages could potentially be used for injection if they include untrusted input, but in this code, the inputs are parameters and are not directly sourced from untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Parameters passed to exceptions are incorporated into message strings; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base ModbusException. Each class constructs a message string incorporating the provided 'string' parameter. No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic execution are involved. The message parameters are used to generate exception messages, but there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code appears to be purely for error handling within a larger Modbus application framework. No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in a Modbus communication context. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It is a benign, well-structured code module.",
