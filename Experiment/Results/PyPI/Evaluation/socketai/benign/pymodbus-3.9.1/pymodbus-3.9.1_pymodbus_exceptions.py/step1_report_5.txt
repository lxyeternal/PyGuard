  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various Modbus protocol errors in a network communication context.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and constants without external data input.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink is present as this is only exception class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of class definitions with standard exception handling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes inheriting from the base Exception class, designed to handle specific Modbus communication errors. All classes follow standard patterns without dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be straightforward exception class definitions intended for error handling within a larger Modbus implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining custom exceptions related to Modbus protocol errors, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard, safe, and well-structured for its purpose.",
