  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various Modbus protocol errors in a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and initializations that set up custom exception messages.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiations and string formatting for error messages.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects -> message formatting -> raising exceptions with descriptive strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded strings are standard for exception messages, no use of external input sources, no suspicious data handling or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of several custom exception classes derived from a base ModbusException, each providing specific error messages related to Modbus operations. No user input, network data, or external data sources are handled within this code. All messages are hardcoded or passed as parameters, with no indication of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The purpose is purely to facilitate error handling with clear messages. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, benign implementation of custom exception classes for a Modbus protocol library. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code is well-structured for its purpose and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
