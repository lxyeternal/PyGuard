  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Modbus protocol error handling.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions and their initializations.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__(string) calls to propagate error messages.",
  "flows": "Raised exceptions with specific messages; no data flow from untrusted sources identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected; standard exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of custom exceptions inheriting from a base ModbusException class, used for error handling in Modbus communication. The constructors format specific error messages, and the __str__ method provides a string representation. No input/output operations, data processing, or network activity are present. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for a Modbus library, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
