  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in a Modbus communication library.",
  "sources": "Exception class initializers and their messages, potentially user-injected strings.",
  "sinks": "String representations of exceptions, potentially logged or displayed.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exceptions with custom messages, calling __str__ method to output error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, no obfuscated code or suspicious imports. The code solely defines exception classes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a set of custom exception classes inheriting from a base ModbusException. Each class initializes with optional message strings, prepends specific tags, and calls the superclass initializer. No input reading, no data flow beyond setting message strings, and no code executing outside exception handling. No suspicious patterns, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The structure and content are typical for exception class definitions in Python libraries.",
  "conclusion": "This code purely defines exception classes for a Modbus protocol implementation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured exception handling code.",
