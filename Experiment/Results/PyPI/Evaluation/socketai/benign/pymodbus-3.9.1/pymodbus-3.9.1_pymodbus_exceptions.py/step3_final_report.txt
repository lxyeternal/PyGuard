{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various Modbus protocol errors and related error conditions.",
  "sources": "Exception class constructors and message formatting within the class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; exception messages are parameterized but do not process external data.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects with message parameters; no data flow outside class initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward class definitions with no dynamic or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for Modbus errors, with clear message formatting and inheritance from a base exception class. No network activity, data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The exception messages are parameterized but do not involve external or untrusted data sources. The structure is standard and benign, serving purely as error handling mechanisms. The code's static nature and lack of external interactions indicate no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of custom exception classes for Modbus error handling. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
