  "purpose": "Define constants, enumerations, and status codes for Modbus server/client operations and communication parameters.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data sources; it solely defines constants and enums.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could be processed or influence the program's behavior are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only establishes static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The code appears to be standard enumeration and constant definitions for protocol handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides constant definitions and enum classes for Modbus protocol status and data types. There are no data processing, input handling, or security-sensitive operations. The definitions follow standard practices for protocol implementations and do not exhibit signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors. No external data is read or transmitted within this module, and no insecure coding patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign set of constants and enums for Modbus protocol handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
