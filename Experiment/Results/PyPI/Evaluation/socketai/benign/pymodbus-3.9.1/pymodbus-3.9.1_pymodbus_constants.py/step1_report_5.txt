{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and enumerations for Modbus server/client operations and statuses.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources; the code solely defines static constants and enums.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs involved; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow or processing logic, only constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code strictly defines enums and constants without dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured constants for Modbus protocol status codes, byte orderings, and request types. It uses Python enum and str classes appropriately, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. There are no input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All definitions are static, intended for protocol handling and configuration purposes, and do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of constants and enums used for Modbus protocol implementations. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. It appears safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
