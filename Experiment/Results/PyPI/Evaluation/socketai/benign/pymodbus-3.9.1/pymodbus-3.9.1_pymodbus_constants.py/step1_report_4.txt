  "purpose": "Define constants and enumerations for Modbus server/client operations, statuses, and data types.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments, enum class definitions, class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to untrusted sources; code only defines constants and enums.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution; the code appears to be straightforward definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides various enums and constants related to Modbus protocol operations. It uses standard Python enum and string class inheritance, with descriptive docstrings. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, code injection, or backdoors. The constants are static and serve a configuration purpose. No untrusted input handling or external data processing is present. Overall, the code is purely definitional, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of constants and enums for Modbus protocol management. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, and poses no security threat. It is safe for use.",
