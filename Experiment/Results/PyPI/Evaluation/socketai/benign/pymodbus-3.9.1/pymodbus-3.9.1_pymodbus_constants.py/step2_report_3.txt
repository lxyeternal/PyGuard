  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is purely static, defining constants and enums for Modbus protocol implementation. There are no signs of dynamic behavior, user input processing, or external data handling. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration module.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**  \n   No logical errors, flaws, or mistakes are identified across the reports. The code is well-structured, with appropriate use of enum classes and descriptive docstrings. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are noted.\n\n3. **Score Justification & Consistency:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's static, non-interactive nature.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions:**  \n   The code is purely definitional. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. Therefore, no assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified.\n\n5. **Scores vs. Analysis:**  \n   The scores assigned by all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the benign, static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Recommendations:\n\nGiven the thorough review, I agree with the current scores. No changes are necessary. The code poses no security threat and functions solely as a static configuration module.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe, and benign set of constants and enum definitions for Modbus protocol implementation. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final Scores:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0**",
