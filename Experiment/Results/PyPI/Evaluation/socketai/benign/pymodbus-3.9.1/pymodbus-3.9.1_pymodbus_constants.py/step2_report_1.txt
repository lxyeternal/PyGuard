  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely static, defining constants and enums for Modbus protocol.\n- No external data, user input, or dynamic behavior is involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The code serves as a configuration module, with no network or I/O operations.\n\n**Assessment of each report:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - Purpose: Static constants/enums for Modbus.  \n   - Findings: No data leaks, no untrusted sources, no anomalies.  \n   - Conclusion: Benign, no security issues.  \n   - Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Risk: 0.  \n   **Verdict:** Fully reasonable.\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - Purpose: Similar static definitions.  \n   - Findings: No external data processing, no suspicious code.  \n   - Conclusion: Safe, standard practice.  \n   - Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Risk: 0.  \n   **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - Purpose: Same as above.  \n   - Findings: No malicious patterns, no dynamic code, no external data.  \n   - Conclusion: Benign.  \n   - Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Risk: 0.  \n   **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - Purpose: Defines constants/enums for Modbus.  \n   - Findings: No data flow, no external input, no obfuscation.  \n   - Conclusion: Safe.  \n   - Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Risk: 0.  \n   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - Purpose: Static definitions.  \n   - Findings: No suspicious behavior, no external data.  \n   - Conclusion: Benign.  \n   - Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Risk: 0.  \n   **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Final analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify that there is no malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** Since the code is purely static configuration, the risk score should be zero or very close to it.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n- No issues found that would justify increasing the risk or malware scores.\n- The scores given (all zero for malware and obfuscated, and zero for risk) are appropriate.\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (static constants, no external influence, no vulnerabilities)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is a benign configuration module for Modbus protocol.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk. The code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
