{
  "purpose": "Static definitions of constants and enums for Modbus protocol handling, serving as configuration data.",
  "sources": "The module imports enum and defines constants and enum classes; no external data sources or input processing.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines static values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, well-structured, with descriptive docstrings, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, defining constants and enums for Modbus protocol. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or include dynamic code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code serves as a configuration module, with no external data handling or runtime behavior that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and safe. It functions solely as a configuration module for Modbus protocol constants and enums. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0.",
