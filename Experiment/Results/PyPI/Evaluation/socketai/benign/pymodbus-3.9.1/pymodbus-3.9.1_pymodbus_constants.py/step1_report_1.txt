{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and enumerations for Modbus server/client protocol implementation, including status codes, byte order, operations, device information types, and data continuation indicators.",
  "sources": "Imports enum module; defines constant strings and enum classes with fixed values.",
  "sinks": "No user input, external data, or untrusted sources are present that could lead to data leaks or code injection.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only establishes static constants and enum types.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs observed. All enums use fixed, non-parameterized values; no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a static configuration module for Modbus protocol constants, defining status codes, byte order options, and request types. It uses enum classes for clarity and type safety, with no user input, no network communication, or data manipulation involved. No potential security issues or malicious behavior are detected. The implementation appears standard and straightforward, focusing solely on constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration and constants module for Modbus protocols. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities. It functions as intended for its purpose without introducing security risks.",
