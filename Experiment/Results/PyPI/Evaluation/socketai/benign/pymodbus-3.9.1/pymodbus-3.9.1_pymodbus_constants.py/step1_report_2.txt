  "purpose": "Define constants and enumerations for Modbus server/client configurations and operations.",
  "sources": "Importing enum module; defining constant strings; class attributes and enum members.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or output; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Constants and enums are used for internal logic; no flow of untrusted data from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs. The code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static constants and enum classes to represent Modbus statuses, endianness, operations, and device information types. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or include any dynamic code execution. The only string constant is an error message. No malicious patterns or security risks are present. The code structure and formatting are normal for a configuration module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard constants and enum definitions module for Modbus protocols with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is unlikely to pose any security risks.",
