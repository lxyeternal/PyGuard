  "purpose": "This code defines the public interface and metadata for the pymodbus library, including version information and imported components.",
  "sources": "It reads its own module-level variables and imports from other modules within the pymodbus package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily imports and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious hardcoded secrets; the code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up module exports (__all__), assigns version strings, and imports specific classes and functions from internal modules. There are no external data inputs, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. It functions as a standard library module with no apparent malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign library module that provides metadata and imports, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
