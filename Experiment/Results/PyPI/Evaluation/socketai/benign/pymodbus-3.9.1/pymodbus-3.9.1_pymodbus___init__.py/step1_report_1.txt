{
  "purpose": "To provide module-level metadata and facilitate importing specific classes and functions from the pymodbus package.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (__version__, __version_full__) and imports from internal modules (pymodbus.exceptions, pymodbus.framer, pymodbus.logging, pymodbus.pdu).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or cause side effects in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up imports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected. No unusual patterns or behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module exports, imports specific components from internal modules, and sets version information. There are no input handling, user data processing, or side-effect inducing operations. All actions are standard for a Python package's __init__.py or module setup file. The code does not include any network activity, data leaks, or malicious commands. It appears to be a clean, simple setup/configuration file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for the pymodbus library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only manages imports and version metadata, with no external data handling or suspicious activities.",
