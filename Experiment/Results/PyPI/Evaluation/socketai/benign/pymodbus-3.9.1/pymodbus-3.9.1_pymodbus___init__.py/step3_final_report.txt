{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization script for the pymodbus package, defining exported symbols, importing internal components, and setting version metadata.",
  "sources": "Static version strings (__version__, __version_full__), internal module imports (pymodbus.exceptions, pymodbus.framer, pymodbus.logging, pymodbus.pdu)",
  "sinks": "None; no data handling, network operations, or untrusted data processing present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; purely import and metadata setup",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward and standard module setup code",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py or module setup file, with no input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It only defines __all__, imports specific classes/functions, and sets version strings. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initialization script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All observed signals support a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
