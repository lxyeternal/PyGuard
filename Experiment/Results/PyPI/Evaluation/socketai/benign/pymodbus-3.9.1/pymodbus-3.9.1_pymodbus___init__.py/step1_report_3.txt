  "purpose": "This code defines the public API and metadata for the pymodbus package, which implements the Modbus protocol.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pymodbus modules (exceptions, framer, logging, pdu)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows from untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up module exports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines module exports, imports specific classes/functions from other modules, and sets version strings. No user input, network activity, or data processing is involved. It appears to be a straightforward package initialization file. The imported modules might contain vulnerabilities, but within this snippet, there is no malicious logic or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a typical module setup file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply exports certain symbols and defines version info.",
