{
  "purpose": "To provide module-level metadata and import specific components from the pymodbus library for a Modbus protocol implementation.",
  "sources": "The code imports components from pymodbus.exceptions, pymodbus.framer, pymodbus.logging, and pymodbus.pdu.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data processing or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports modules and sets version information; there are no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of module-level metadata, a list of exported symbols, and imports of standard components from the pymodbus package. It includes version information as strings and a list of functions/objects for external use. No input reading, data processing, or network activities are present. The structure is typical for a Python module's __init__.py file, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply exports specific components and version info from the pymodbus library.",
