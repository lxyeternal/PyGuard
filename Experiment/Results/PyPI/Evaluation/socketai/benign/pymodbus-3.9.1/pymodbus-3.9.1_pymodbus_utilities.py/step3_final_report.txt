  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling Modbus data, including dynamic property creation and converting byte packets to hex strings.",
  "sources": "Input data for dict_property (store, index), packet bytes for hexlify_packets",
  "sinks": "hexlify_packets outputs hex string; dict_property creates class properties that access or modify store or object attributes",
  "flows": "Input data (store, index) -> property getter/setter; packet bytes -> hex string output",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; functions are straightforward utilities",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for data handling in Modbus protocols. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The property creation function dynamically generates properties based on input store or object attributes, which is safe in this context. The hexlify_packets function converts bytes to hex strings, a common debugging or logging utility. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security flaws are evident. The code is benign and intended for internal data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0, reflecting its safe and standard nature.",
