  "purpose": "Import the Tree class or function from a local module named Tree.",
  "sources": "Local import statement from the current package or directory.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not handle external data or untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows are apparent from this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and appears to be a straightforward import; no unusual or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a local import of the Tree component from a sibling module. There are no indications of data handling, user input, or external network activity. Given its simplicity, it does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The minimal code suggests it is part of a larger module that may define or utilize a Tree class, but this snippet alone is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security issues identified.",
