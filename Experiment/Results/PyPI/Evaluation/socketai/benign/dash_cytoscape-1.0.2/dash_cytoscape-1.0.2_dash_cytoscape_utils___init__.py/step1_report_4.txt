  "anomalies": "Single import statement with no additional code, no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of an import statement from a relative module, which is standard Python practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious code execution. The simplicity suggests it is a normal import operation within a package.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard module import with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and typical for Python package structure.",
