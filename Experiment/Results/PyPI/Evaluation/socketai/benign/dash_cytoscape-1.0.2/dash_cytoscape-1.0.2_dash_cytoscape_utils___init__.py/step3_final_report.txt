  "purpose": "Import the Tree class from a local module named Tree, likely for use in a larger data structure or algorithm implementation.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which reads the Tree class from the local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs are involved; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports a class; there are no data flows or runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of the Tree class from a local module. All reports correctly identify the benign and standard nature of this code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), and the malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all zero, reflecting the benign and standard practice of importing a class in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent, and no modifications to the scores are necessary.",
