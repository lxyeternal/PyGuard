{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Dash web application to display images encoded in base64 from a local directory and automate snapshot testing with Percy for visual regression.",
  "sources": "The code reads image files from the 'screenshots' directory using os.listdir and open files in create_app() via open().",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with the web driver via dash_duo.driver.get() and dash_duo.wait_for_element_by_id(), which navigate to URLs and wait for specific elements, respectively.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading image filenames from the local directory (source), navigating the driver to the image URLs, and capturing snapshots via Percy (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are detected. The code performs typical web app and testing functions, with no obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a Dash app that dynamically displays images based on URL pathnames, encoding image files in base64 for display. It uses pytest parameterization to run snapshot tests on multiple scenarios. The code reads local image files, encodes them, and interacts with a web driver to load images and take Percy snapshots. No external network connections besides loading local files and the web driver are present. No suspicious data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious activities are detected. The use of standard libraries and testing frameworks suggests normal testing behavior without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard testing script for visual regression with Percy, utilizing local images and web driver automation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks within this module.",
