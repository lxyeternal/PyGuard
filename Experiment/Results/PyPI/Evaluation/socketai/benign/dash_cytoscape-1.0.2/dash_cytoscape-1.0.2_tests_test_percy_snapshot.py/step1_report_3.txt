{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to create a Dash web application that displays base64-encoded images from a specified directory and performs visual snapshot testing using Percy for regression verification.",
  "sources": "File reading from image files in the 'screenshots' directory; URL path input from Dash callback; directory listing for image files.",
  "sinks": "Loading images into the webpage via html.Img src attribute; navigating to URLs constructed from directory and image filenames; Percy snapshot function that triggers visual testing.",
  "flows": "Image files are read from disk (source), their base64-encoded data is embedded in HTML img tags (sink), URL paths determine which image is displayed, and the Percy snapshot captures the current state of the page.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.path and file reading are standard; no hardcoded credentials, environment variables, or suspicious external network calls are present. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns observed. Sleep calls are used for delays, which is normal in test scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a Dash app that dynamically displays images based on URL paths, encoding images in base64, which is safe. The test function parametrizes different test cases, starts the server, and runs Percy snapshots on images. All operations involve standard file I/O, web navigation, and testing libraries, with no suspicious network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior detected. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate purpose of visual regression testing for a web application using Percy. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected based on static analysis. The code is straightforward, using standard libraries and testing patterns, with no evident security risks.",
