  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code reads images from a local 'screenshots' directory, encodes them in base64, and serves them via a Dash web app.\n- It uses Selenium WebDriver (via dash_duo) to navigate to image URLs and take snapshots with Percy.\n- No external network activity beyond local filesystem access and WebDriver interactions.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code's purpose is clearly for visual regression testing, which is a legitimate and common practice.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain compromise.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  The code appears to function as intended for its testing purpose. No vulnerabilities, malicious code, or security flaws are identified.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or security flaws:**  \n  The code relies on local filesystem access and standard testing libraries. It doesn't perform any insecure operations. No flaws are apparent.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), but all low, which is reasonable given the context.\n\n### Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:\n- No report assigns a risk score above 0.5. Given the code's nature, this is appropriate.\n\n### Malware Justification:\n- The code does not perform any network communication with untrusted domains, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.\n- The only network activity is via WebDriver to load local image URLs, which is benign.\n\n### Assumption-based Vulnerabilities:\n- No claims are made based on assumptions; all analysis is based on static code review.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary and Personal Estimate:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n**0** — No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n**0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n**0.1–0.2** — Very low, consistent with a testing utility.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nThe code is a standard, legitimate visual regression testing setup. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is warranted based on static analysis.",
