{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Dash web application to display images stored locally, encode them in base64, and serve them via URL routing. It uses Selenium WebDriver (via dash_duo) to navigate to these image URLs and take visual snapshots with Percy for regression testing.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads images from 'screenshots' directory; WebDriver navigates to image URLs; Percy captures snapshots.",
  "sinks": "WebDriver loads local image URLs; Percy captures visual snapshots; no external data exfiltration or network communication with untrusted domains.",
  "flows": "Filesystem read -> encode in base64 -> serve via Dash app -> WebDriver navigates to URL -> Percy captures snapshot.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Use of time.sleep() is a standard testing pattern, not an anomaly.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard visual regression testing using Dash, Selenium WebDriver, and Percy. It reads images locally, encodes them, and displays them via a web app. The WebDriver navigates to these images for snapshotting. No network activity beyond local filesystem and WebDriver interactions is present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the testing context. All reports are consistent in their assessment, and no vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard visual regression testing utility with no malicious or security concerns. It performs its intended function safely, with scores reflecting a benign profile.",
