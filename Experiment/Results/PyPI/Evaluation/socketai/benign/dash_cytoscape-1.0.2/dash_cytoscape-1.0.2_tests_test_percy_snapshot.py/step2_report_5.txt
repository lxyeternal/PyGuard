  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a Dash-based web app that loads images from the filesystem, encodes them in base64, serves them via URL routes, and uses Selenium/WebDriver with Percy to perform visual snapshot testing.\n- The analysis in each report consistently states that the code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and performs legitimate testing functions.\n- No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The only notable \"security risk\" scores are around 0.1–0.2, which is reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code reads image files from the filesystem and encodes them for display.\n- Navigates WebDriver to image URLs for snapshotting.\n- Uses Percy for visual regression testing.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security flaws.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:\n- No significant errors or flaws are apparent.\n- Minor note: The use of `time.sleep(2)` could be replaced with more robust waits, but this is a testing pattern, not a security flaw.\n- The code assumes images exist in the specified directories; missing images could cause runtime errors, but this is a functional concern, not a security issue.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware Score (0):** No malicious activity, no suspicious network calls, no data exfiltration, no backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score (~0.1–0.2):** The code's purpose is testing; no security risks are inherent. Slightly elevated due to filesystem access and web driver interactions, but these are standard in testing environments.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is benign, which appears justified based on static analysis.\n- No evidence suggests the code could be used maliciously or has hidden payloads.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal filesystem and web driver interactions but no real security concern)\n\nThe code is a standard, legitimate testing utility for visual regression with Percy, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, clear, and intended for testing purposes. No security issues or malicious activity are present. The scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated, with a very low security risk score (~0.1).",
