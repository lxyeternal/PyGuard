{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Dash web application that displays images encoded in base64, used for visual snapshot testing with Percy in a testing environment.",
  "sources": "Reading image files from the filesystem in the 'encode' function, listing files in the 'screenshots' directory, and accessing 'sys.version_info'.",
  "sinks": "Serving base64-encoded images in HTML via the 'display_image' callback, and navigating the WebDriver to image URLs in 'run_percy_on'.",
  "flows": "Images are read from disk and encoded; URLs trigger the callback to display images; WebDriver navigates to image URLs for snapshotting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The code uses standard libraries and testing patterns. No obfuscated code or obfuscated language features.",
  "analysis": "The code loads image files from the filesystem and encodes them into base64 strings for web display. It uses Dash callbacks to dynamically serve images based on URL pathnames, which is standard for such applications. The 'run_percy_on' function navigates the Selenium WebDriver to image URLs for snapshotting, which is a legitimate testing pattern. No suspicious data exfiltration, network communication with untrusted domains, or malicious system modifications are present. The code strictly adheres to a test setup for visual regression testing with Percy. No anomalies, backdoors, or malware signatures are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a visual snapshot testing setup using Dash, Percy, and Selenium. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate testing utility without any harmful intent.",
