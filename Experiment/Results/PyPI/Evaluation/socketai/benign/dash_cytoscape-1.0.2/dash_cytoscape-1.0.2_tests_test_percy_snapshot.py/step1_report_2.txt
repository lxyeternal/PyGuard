{
  "purpose": "This code creates a Dash web application to display base64-encoded images and automate the process of taking visual snapshots with Percy for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "File system reads: os.path.join, os.listdir, open() for reading images; sys.version_info for environment info",
  "sinks": "dash_duo.driver.get() loads images into the browser; dash_duo.percy_snapshot() sends snapshot data to Percy service",
  "flows": "Images are read from disk and encoded; URL path triggers display_image callback to show images; run_percy_on loads images in the browser for snapshotting",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; straightforward logic; no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed",
  "analysis": "The code securely reads images from the local filesystem, encodes them in base64, and displays them via a Dash app. The test function automates visiting image URLs and capturing snapshots using Percy. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft. Use of time.sleep() and web driver interactions are typical in testing frameworks. No suspicious or malicious code segments detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing utility for visual regression testing with Percy. It performs local file reads, URL-based image rendering, and snapshotting without any malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
