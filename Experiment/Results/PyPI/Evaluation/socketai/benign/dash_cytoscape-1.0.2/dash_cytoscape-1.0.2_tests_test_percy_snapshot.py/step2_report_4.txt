  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code reads image files from a local 'screenshots' directory, encodes them in base64, and serves them via a Dash app.\n- It uses Selenium WebDriver (via dash_duo) to navigate to image URLs and take Percy snapshots.\n- No external network calls other than local file access and WebDriver interactions.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The code's purpose is clearly for visual regression testing.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly identified; standard for visual testing.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The reviewer correctly states no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Security Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Confidence: 0.9 (reasonable)\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment aligns with the code's behavior. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (slightly above zero but justified given the code's nature)\n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Note:** The security risk is minimal, given the code only reads local files and interacts with a testing driver.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, straightforward testing code.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.1 (appropriate)\n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, standard testing pattern.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (justified)\n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain risks.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (~0.1-0.2) for security risk, justified by the code's file I/O and WebDriver interactions, which are standard in testing but could be misused if misconfigured. Given the context, these are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious intent or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — low, but slightly elevated due to file and driver interactions, which are typical in testing environments but could pose risks if misused.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and consistent with the code's behavior. No changes are necessary. The code appears to be a legitimate testing utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
