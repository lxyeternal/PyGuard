  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the accuracy of their assessments and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- Dynamically imports modules based on predefined filenames.\n- Starts a Dash web server for each module.\n- Waits for specific page elements.\n- Takes screenshots and saves them locally.\n- Uses standard libraries (`os`, `importlib`, `pytest`, `time`).\n- No network activity, no user input beyond test parameters, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets.\n- The dynamic import is controlled via test parameters, not external input.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nThe report states the code is for automating web app testing, with no malicious behavior, and the dynamic import is standard for test automation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 (slightly elevated, but still low)\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate.  \n- The security risk score is slightly above zero, justified by the dynamic import, but since module names are predefined and controlled, this is acceptable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe report's reasoning aligns with the code. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nSimilar to Report 1, emphasizing standard test automation with controlled dynamic import, no network activity, no malicious code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 (even lower)\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate.  \n- Security risk is minimal; the slight increase over zero accounts for dynamic import, which is acceptable here.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are justified; the reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nAgain, standard testing with no signs of malicious activity. Emphasizes filesystem operations and dynamic import as routine.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The low malware and obfuscated scores are correct.  \n- Security risk is minimal, justified by the controlled environment.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAppropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nSame as above, straightforward testing with no malicious behavior. Filesystem operations are standard.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.  \n- Security risk score of zero is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores and reasoning are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nAgain, a typical visual regression testing script with no signs of malicious activity. The use of dynamic import is controlled via test parameters.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The scores are appropriate.  \n- Slightly elevated security risk score accounts for dynamic import, but it's within a safe context.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe report's reasoning and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero, justified by dynamic import, but within safe bounds given controlled inputs.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No modifications needed.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as standard test automation with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, controlled dynamic import, no network activity)\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is a legitimate testing script with minimal security considerations, and the reports' evaluations are accurate.",
