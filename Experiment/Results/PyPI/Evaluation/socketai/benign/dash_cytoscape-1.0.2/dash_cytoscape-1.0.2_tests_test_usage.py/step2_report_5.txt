  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the code to assess accuracy, consistency, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a test automation script that dynamically imports modules, launches web app instances, waits for page elements, and saves screenshots.\n- It uses standard libraries (`os`, `importlib`, `pytest`, `time`) and a testing framework (`dash_duo`).\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- Dynamic imports are based on predefined, controlled test parameters, not external user input.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or malware indicators are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**  \nNo malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, dynamic import is standard, low security risk, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code aligns with standard testing practices.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None observed.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 seem reasonable given the controlled environment.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The low score reflects minimal security concern; no vulnerabilities or malware.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**  \nSimilar to Report 1, emphasizes standard testing, controlled dynamic import, no network activity, low risk.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** None.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code's behavior is typical for test automation; no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**  \nAgain, describes standard testing, no suspicious behavior, filesystem operations are routine.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** None.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 fits the context.\n- **Justification:** No security concerns identified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**  \nDescribes the same pattern—dynamic module import, filesystem operations, no malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** None.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No security risks or malware.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**  \nSame conclusion—standard test automation, no malicious activity, low security risk.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** None.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 seem justified.\n- **Justification:** No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports correctly identify that the code is a standard test automation script with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.0 to 0.2), which aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Potential improvements:**  \n- The only slight concern is the use of dynamic import based on test parameters, but since these are controlled and predefined, the risk remains minimal.\n- No need to increase the risk score unless external, uncontrolled input influences module names.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports — correct.\n- **Risk score:** Keep at or below 0.2 unless external inputs are introduced.\n\n**Estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThe reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and consistent with the code. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are evident. The code is a typical, controlled test automation script.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \n**The code is safe, and the reports correctly assess the security posture.**",
