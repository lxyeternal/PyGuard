{
  "purpose": "The code sets up automated testing for a web application, loading different usage demo modules and taking screenshots of their rendered pages.",
  "sources": "Reads the module filenames from the parameterized test input and dynamically imports the corresponding modules. Uses os.path and os.makedirs to handle filesystem paths and create directories.",
  "sinks": "Saves screenshots to specified directories via dash_duo.driver.save_screenshot, which writes files to the local filesystem.",
  "flows": "Module filenames are imported dynamically, then the app is started and a screenshot is saved to a directory based on the filename.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution beyond standard importlib.import_module, which is typical for test setups. No network activity or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules based on filenames provided in a parameterized test, starts a web server, waits for page elements, and takes screenshots, saving them locally. The filesystem operations are standard and do not involve sensitive data or malicious payloads. The use of importlib for dynamic imports is typical for test frameworks and does not indicate malicious intent. No network calls, data leaks, or backdoors are present. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward automated testing script for web applications, involving dynamic module imports, filesystem operations, and screenshot captures. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
