{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform automated testing of a web application using the Dash framework and pytest, capturing screenshots of different pages or components.",
  "sources": "Input data includes the 'filename' parameter passed to 'create_usage_test' and the list of test names, which are used to import modules and determine test behavior.",
  "sinks": "Screenshots are saved to a specified directory, and modules are imported dynamically based on filenames.",
  "flows": "The function imports modules dynamically based on filenames, starts a server for the app, waits for elements, possibly sleeps, creates directories, and saves screenshots.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, malicious obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. The dynamic import based on filenames is typical in test automation but could pose risks if filenames are controlled maliciously, although unlikely here.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard automated testing tasks: dynamic import, server startup, element waiting, optional sleep for specific tests, directory creation, and screenshot saving. It does not include any network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious code. The dynamic import is controlled via the 'filename' parameter, which is only used to import modules, not execute arbitrary code beyond the test scope. No suspicious behavior or malware indicators are present. The code structure and functions are typical for test automation frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test automation script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely performs web application testing and screenshot capturing without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
