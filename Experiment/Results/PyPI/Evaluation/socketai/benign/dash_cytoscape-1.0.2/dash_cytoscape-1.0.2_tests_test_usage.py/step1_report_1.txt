{
  "purpose": "This code is used to automate testing of a web application by loading different modules and taking screenshots for visual verification.",
  "sources": "The code reads module names from the parameterized test cases, uses importlib to load modules dynamically, and accesses file paths to save screenshots.",
  "sinks": "The code writes screenshots to disk and creates directories; no untrusted data is written to external systems or transmitted over the network.",
  "flows": "Input module names -> import modules -> start server -> wait for page elements -> save screenshot to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Usage of dynamic imports is standard for test automation but can be risky if module names are externally influenced, which is unlikely here.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules based on predefined names, launches web servers for testing, waits for page elements, and saves screenshots. All file paths are constructed from local directories. There are no signs of malicious code, external data transmission, or obfuscated logic. The dynamic import could pose a risk if module names are externally controlled, but in a test context with parameterized inputs, this is standard and not suspicious. No suspicious network activity or data leakage observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate automated testing script with no malicious behavior. It safely loads modules, interacts with web pages, and stores screenshots locally. No malicious activity or security risks detected.",
