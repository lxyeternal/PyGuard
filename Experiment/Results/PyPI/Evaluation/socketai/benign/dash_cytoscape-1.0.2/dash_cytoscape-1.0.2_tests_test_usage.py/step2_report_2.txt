  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code's behavior.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Dynamically imports modules based on predefined filenames.\n- Starts a web server for each app.\n- Waits for specific DOM elements.\n- Occasionally sleeps (for specific tests).\n- Creates directories if needed.\n- Saves screenshots to local disk.\n- Uses standard libraries and testing frameworks.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated/malicious code observed.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of dynamic import (`importlib.import_module`)**: standard in test automation but can be risky if filenames are externally controlled. Here, filenames are predefined in the parameterized test, so the risk is minimal.\n- **Filesystem operations**: directory creation and screenshot saving are straightforward.\n- **No network activity, no data leaks, no code obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.**\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis**: Correctly identifies the code as a test automation script.\n- **Malware score**: 0 — aligns with the code.\n- **Security risk**: 0.2 — perhaps slightly high, but considering the code's scope, this is acceptable.\n- **Conclusion**: No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Verdict**: Reasonable, no changes needed.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis**: Similar to Report 1, accurate.\n- **Malware score**: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk**: 0.1 — aligns with the code.\n- **Conclusion**: No malicious activity.\n- **Verdict**: Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & analysis**: Correctly describes the script.\n- **Malware score**: 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk**: 0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Verdict**: Valid.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis**: Accurate.\n- **Malware score**: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk**: 0 — consistent.\n- **Verdict**: Reasonable.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & analysis**: Correct.\n- **Malware score**: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk**: 0.1 — acceptable.\n- **Verdict**: Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores**: All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores**: All 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk scores**: Slightly above zero but reasonable given the context. The only potential concern is the dynamic import based on test parameters, but since the filenames are controlled within the test suite, this is not malicious.\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The **risk scores** could be slightly lowered to 0.0, considering the controlled nature of the test filenames and absence of malicious activity.\n- The **malware scores** are correctly assigned as 0.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are correctly assigned as 0.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score**: **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score**: **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score**: **0** — no security risks identified, given the controlled test environment.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent with the code's behavior. The code is a standard automated testing script with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, though a slight adjustment of risk scores to zero could be justified.\n\n**Final note:** No suspicious or malicious activity is evident. The code is safe within the context of controlled test automation.",
