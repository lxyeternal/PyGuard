  "purpose": "Automated testing of Dash web applications by dynamically importing modules, launching servers, waiting for elements, and capturing screenshots.",
  "sources": "Module filenames from test parameters, filesystem for saving screenshots, environment variables (not used here).",
  "sinks": "Filesystem for saving images; no network or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Import modules based on filenames -> start server -> wait for elements -> save screenshots.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward test automation code with controlled dynamic import.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard automated UI testing with controlled dynamic imports, filesystem operations, and no network activity. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The dynamic import is based on predefined filenames, minimizing risk. Filesystem operations are local and routine. No suspicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe test automation script with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The malware score should remain 0, obfuscated score 0, and the risk score around 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal risk due to controlled dynamic import.",
