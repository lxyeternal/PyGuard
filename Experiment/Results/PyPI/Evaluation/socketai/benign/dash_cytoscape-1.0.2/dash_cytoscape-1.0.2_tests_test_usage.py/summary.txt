  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe test automation script with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The malware score should remain 0, obfuscated score 0, and the risk score around 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal risk due to controlled dynamic import."
