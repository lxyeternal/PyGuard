{
  "purpose": "The code appears to automate the testing of a web application, taking screenshots of various pages or states for quality assurance or documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "os.path, os.makedirs, os.path.join, os.path.dirname, importlib.import_module, pytest, dash_duo (test framework), time.sleep",
  "sinks": "dash_duo.driver.save_screenshot (writes screenshots to disk), os.makedirs (creates directories), importlib.import_module (imports modules dynamically)",
  "flows": "The code dynamically imports modules based on provided filenames, then uses dash_duo to start servers and interact with web pages, ultimately saving screenshots to specific directories.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are present. Use of dynamic module import is standard in testing frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a testing environment for a web app, loading different pages based on parameterized names, waiting for elements to load, and saving screenshots. It employs standard libraries for filesystem operations and module imports. No data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors are observed. The code appears to be a typical test suite for UI validation with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate test script for automating screenshots of a web application. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It operates within expected parameters for testing and file handling.",
