{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a Dash Cytoscape module, loads package metadata, and sets up external JavaScript and CSS resources for the component. It also provides functions to load extra layouts and display default property values.",
  "sources": "Reads package.json for package info, reads metadata.json for component defaults, and imports external JavaScript files via URLs.",
  "sinks": "External URLs for JS resources could potentially be manipulated if URLs are not properly sanitized, but here they are hardcoded with format placeholders. The code does not execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Package info from package.json and metadata.json flows into variables and functions; external JS URLs are constructed from package info. No untrusted data flows into dangerous functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. External URLs are standard CDN links, and no dynamic execution of code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily loads package metadata, configures external dependencies, and provides utility functions. It performs file I/O operations on static JSON files, constructs URLs for external scripts, and sets attributes on module components. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious data handling. The URL formatting uses package info but relies on predefined package data, reducing risk. No suspicious dynamic code execution, network connections, or data exfiltration are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Dash Cytoscape component with standard practices. There are no signs of malware, malicious activity, or security risks within this module.",
