  "purpose": "Standard package initialization for a Dash component, reading configuration files and setting up CDN resource URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads 'package.json' and 'metadata.json' files; constructs CDN URLs using package metadata.",
  "sinks": "External CDN URLs for JavaScript resources; no untrusted input processing or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads static JSON files, formats URLs with package info, assigns URLs to component attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; static file reads and URL formatting are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks: reading static configuration files, constructing CDN URLs from package metadata, and defining utility functions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or untrusted input handling is present. External URLs are from reputable CDNs, and no network activity beyond loading these resources occurs. The scores from all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe package initialization script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. External CDN URLs are from reputable sources, and no dynamic or unsafe operations are present. The low risk score (0.1) is justified given the reliance on external resources, but overall, the code poses minimal security concern.",
