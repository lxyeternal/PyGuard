  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe package initialization script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. External CDN URLs are from reputable sources, and no dynamic or unsafe operations are present. The low risk score (0.1) is justified given the reliance on external resources, but overall, the code poses minimal security concern."
