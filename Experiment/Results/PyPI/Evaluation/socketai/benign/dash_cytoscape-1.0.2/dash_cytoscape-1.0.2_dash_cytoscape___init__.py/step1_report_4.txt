{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and configures a Dash Cytoscape component with additional layouts and dependencies, manages package metadata, and handles dynamic JavaScript and CSS distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'package.json', 'metadata.json', and importing modules; also loading external JS via formatted URLs.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted input data; external URLs are used for JS resources, but they are formatted with package info.",
  "flows": "Package info from JSON files feeds into URL formatting for external scripts; module imports and function calls do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. External URL formatting appears standard; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The code primarily loads resources and handles metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs configuration and setup tasks: reading package and metadata JSON files, setting up JavaScript and CSS distributions, importing modules, and defining functions. The external URLs for JS resources are formatted dynamically with package information but are from reputable sources (unpkg.com). There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code flows are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate setup module for a Dash Cytoscape component. It reads configuration files, dynamically sets resource URLs, and provides functions to load extra layouts and display default component values. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
