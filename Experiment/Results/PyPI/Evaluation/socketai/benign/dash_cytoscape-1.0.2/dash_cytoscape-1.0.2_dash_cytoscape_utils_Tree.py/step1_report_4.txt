  "purpose": "The code defines a Tree class for manipulating hierarchical data structures in Cytoscape visualization, including methods for traversal, node/edge retrieval, and indexing.",
  "sources": "Input data for node_id, children, data, props, edge_data, and edge_props during Tree object creation; data updates in get_nodes and get_edges methods.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present. No external data sinks, network communication, file I/O, or system command executions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from object creation into internal structures, and methods like get_nodes and get_edges assemble data for output. No untrusted data flows into system commands or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard Python features. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard hierarchical data structure with traversal (BFS and DFS), node/edge retrieval, and indexing. No external inputs are processed insecurely, and no malicious behaviors or security issues are evident. Methods operate solely on in-memory data structures without external system interactions. The purpose appears to be visualization data preparation, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for managing tree structures in Cytoscape visualizations. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain threats within this code. It performs standard data handling and traversal operations safely.",
