{
  "purpose": "The code imports the Cytoscape class from a local module and exposes it as part of the package's public API.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.Cytoscape' during the import statement.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "The import source flows into the __all__ list to expose the Cytoscape class publicly.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module pattern for importing and exporting a class. No external data input, no suspicious dynamic code, and no security-sensitive operations are present. It simply re-exports a class from a local module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior. It functions as a typical package module file for controlling what symbols are exposed publicly.",
