  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform unsafe actions",
  "flows": "No data flows from external input to any dangerous sink; the code merely exports a class",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and explicitly exports it for external use. There are no dynamic or unsafe operations, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behaviors. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
