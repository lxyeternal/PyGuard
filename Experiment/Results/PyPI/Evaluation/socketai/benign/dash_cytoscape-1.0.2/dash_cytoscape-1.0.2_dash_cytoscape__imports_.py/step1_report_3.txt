{
  "purpose": "This code defines the public interface for a module by importing and exposing the Cytoscape class.",
  "sources": "The code imports the Cytoscape class from a local module named .Cytoscape.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import of Cytoscape from a local module, then exposing it via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and appears standard. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and specifies it as part of the public API. There are no external inputs, network communications, or data processing. The structure is simple and typical for Python modules. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected based on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic module export statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe pattern for exposing classes in a Python package.",
