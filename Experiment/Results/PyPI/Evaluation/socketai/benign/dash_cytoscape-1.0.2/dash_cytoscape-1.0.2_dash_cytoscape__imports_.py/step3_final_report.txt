  "purpose": "This code imports the Cytoscape class from a local module and exposes it via __all__, serving as a simple module export pattern.",
  "sources": "Import from .Cytoscape module",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement and __all__ declaration, typical for Python packages. No data flows, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's simplicity and standard pattern support a conclusion of no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module pattern with no malicious or security concerns. All reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
