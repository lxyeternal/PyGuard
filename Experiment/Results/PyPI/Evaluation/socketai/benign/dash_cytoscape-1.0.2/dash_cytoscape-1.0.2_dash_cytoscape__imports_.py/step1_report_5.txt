{
  "purpose": "This code module imports the 'Cytoscape' class from a relative package and exposes it as part of the public API.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import statement and the __all__ list definition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The import statement loads a class from a local package; the __all__ list exposes 'Cytoscape' externally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting only of a class import and a __all__ declaration. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detectable based solely on these lines.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module setup exposing a class, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
