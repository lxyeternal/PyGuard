  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured automated testing suite with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The reliance on manual node position calibration is a known testing workaround and does not imply malicious intent. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature."
