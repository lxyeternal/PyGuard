{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python package setup script that reads package metadata from a JSON file and a README, then configures the package with setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'dash_cytoscape/package.json' and 'README.md' files for metadata and description.",
  "sinks": "Uses setuptools.setup() to configure package installation; no untrusted data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads data from external files and passes it directly to setup(), with no dynamic execution or data manipulation that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup operations with static file reads and straightforward data passing. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure behaviors are present. The code is simple, clear, and aligns with standard practices. No external network activity or dynamic code execution occurs. The external files are static and controlled, reducing risk. Overall, the code is benign and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate safe behavior, and the scores should reflect this.",
