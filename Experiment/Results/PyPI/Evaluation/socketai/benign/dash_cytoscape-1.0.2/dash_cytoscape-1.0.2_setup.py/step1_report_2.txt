  "purpose": "This script is for setting up and packaging a Python project, specifically for a package related to 'dash_cytoscape'.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'dash_cytoscape/package.json', environment variables (if any indirectly), and 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "Uses data in 'setup()' to configure package metadata; no direct data sinks or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Reads package.json → processes package info → passes data to setuptools.setup; reads README.md for long description.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic. Uses standard library functions and well-known packaging tools.",
  "analysis": "The code loads package metadata from a JSON file, processes package name to replace spaces and hyphens, and then calls setuptools.setup() with metadata and dependencies. It does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or execute untrusted input. No suspicious behaviors such as code injection, malicious data handling, or backdoors are present. The only external resource is the 'package.json' and 'README.md' files, used for packaging metadata, which is standard practice. The 'install_requires' and 'extras_require' specify dependencies but do not dynamically download or execute anything suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily reads package metadata and configures the package build process.",
