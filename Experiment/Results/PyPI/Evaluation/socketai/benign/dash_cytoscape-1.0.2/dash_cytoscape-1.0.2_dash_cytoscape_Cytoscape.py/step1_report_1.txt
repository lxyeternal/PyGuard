{
  "purpose": "Define a Cytoscape component class for Dash, enabling network visualization and interaction within a web app.",
  "sources": "Imports from dash.development.base_component, class constructor arguments, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code primarily sets properties and configurations for a visualization component.",
  "flows": "Initializes properties from input arguments; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; property assignments are static.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from a base component, specifying numerous configuration properties for a Cytoscape visualization component in Dash. The constructor uses explicit argument handling, setting default values and organizing property names. There are no input/output data handling, no network operations, and no suspicious logic or obfuscation. The entire code appears to be boilerplate for component property definitions, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward component class definition for Dash's Cytoscape visualization library. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It simply declares properties and initializes them without any dangerous operations.",
