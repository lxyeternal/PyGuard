{
  "purpose": "Defines a Dash Cytoscape component class with configuration properties for network visualization.",
  "sources": "Properties such as 'elements', 'contextMenuData', 'tapNodeData', 'mouseoverNodeData', etc., which are set during initialization or via callbacks.",
  "sinks": "Potential downstream handling of untrusted data, but no direct data transmission or processing within this code.",
  "flows": "Initialization and property assignment; no dynamic or external data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition for a Dash component, mainly setting configuration properties for a Cytoscape visualization. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation. The properties are intended for UI interactions and callback data, which could be misused downstream but are not inherently malicious or insecure within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely boilerplate for a Dash Cytoscape component, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from how the properties are handled downstream, outside this code. Overall, it is safe for use.",
