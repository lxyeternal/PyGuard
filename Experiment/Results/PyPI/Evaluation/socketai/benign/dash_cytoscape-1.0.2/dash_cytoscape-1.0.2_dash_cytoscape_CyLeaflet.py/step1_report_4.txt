{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom Dash component, CyLeaflet, integrating Cytoscape with Leaflet maps, for interactive geospatial graph visualization with map overlays.",
  "sources": "Reads include package imports, user-supplied properties (cytoscape_props, leaflet_props, tiles), and data stored in dcc.Store components.",
  "sinks": "Data flows from callbacks that update 'elements' and 'maxZoom' properties, and from clientside functions that update map and cytoscape states based on user interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data from stored data and map interactions flow through clientside callbacks to update cytoscape elements, map extents, and zoom levels.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or hidden backdoors identified. Use of standard libraries and well-structured code. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs a Dash component combining Cytoscape and Leaflet, with clientside callbacks for map and graph synchronization. It handles optional package import (dash_leaflet) and manages default and user-supplied properties, ensuring proper integration. Callbacks are defined to keep the map and graph in sync based on user interactions. No malicious or suspicious behavior such as network exfiltration, code injection, or data theft detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an interactive geospatial graph visualization component. It employs standard packages and callback mechanisms without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
