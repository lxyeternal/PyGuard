  "purpose": "A Dash component integrating Cytoscape and Leaflet for interactive geospatial and network visualization, managing dynamic properties via clientside callbacks.",
  "sources": "Imports from dash, dash_cytoscape, dash_leaflet (optional), and internal class methods reading component states and user props.",
  "sinks": "Clientside callbacks updating 'elements', 'extent', 'maxZoom', and 'viewport' properties based on user interactions and internal state changes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user interactions and internal state into callback functions that modify visualization elements and map properties, then back into component properties.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious URLs, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. External clientside functions are assumed safe; no network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, transparent implementation of a Dash visualization component combining Cytoscape and Leaflet. It handles optional dependencies gracefully, sets default properties, and manages dynamic updates via clientside callbacks. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation are present. External JavaScript functions are external and assumed safe. The data flow is typical for such visualization components, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured visualization component with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware (0), obfuscation (0), and risk scores (~0.1-0.2) are justified given its functionality and structure.",
