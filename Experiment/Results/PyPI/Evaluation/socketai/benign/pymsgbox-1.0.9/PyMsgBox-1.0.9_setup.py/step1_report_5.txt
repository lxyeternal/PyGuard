{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, used to configure package metadata and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'src/pymsgbox/__init__.py' to extract version, and reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is written to external systems or used in insecure ways.",
  "flows": "The version string from the module is extracted and used in package setup; the README content is read and incorporated into package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic code execution. The code simply performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version information from a source file using regex, avoiding loading the entire module. It reads the README file for documentation purposes. The setup() function is called with standard parameters, including package discovery, metadata, and classifiers. All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts and do not involve any suspicious or malicious behavior. No network activity, no sensitive data handling, and no executable code beyond standard package configuration are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any suspicious or malicious code.",
