{
  "purpose": "To configure the setup process for the PyMsgBox Python package, including reading version info and long description.",
  "sources": "Reading version from 'src/pymsgbox/__init__.py'; reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; all data sources are static or file-based inputs.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from source file, then uses static data to configure package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads version information from a specific file using regex, which is safe and standard practice. It also reads a README file for the description. The setup() function uses this data to configure package installation parameters. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code relies solely on static files and standard setup tools, with no signs of malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, with no malicious behaviors or security risks. It follows standard practices for package configuration.",
