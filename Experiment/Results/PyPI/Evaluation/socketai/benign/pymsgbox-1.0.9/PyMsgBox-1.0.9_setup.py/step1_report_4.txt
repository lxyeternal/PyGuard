{
  "purpose": "This script is used to configure the package setup for distribution, including reading version info and long description from files.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information from 'src/pymsgbox/__init__.py' and the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data influences system behavior or leaks data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (version and description) into the setup configuration, with no processing or execution of untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code reads the version string via regex from a source file, but this is a standard practice and not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code present. No suspicious network activity or code injection points.",
  "analysis": "The script loads version info from a specific file using regex, which is a common technique to avoid executing the entire module. It reads the README file for documentation purposes. The setup function is used to define package metadata and dependencies. All actions are typical for a Python package setup script, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. No untrusted data handling, network operations, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security concerns. It follows common practices and does not contain malware or suspicious behavior.",
