{
  "purpose": "To set up the Python package 'PyMsgBox' by loading version info, reading the README, and configuring package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads version info from '__init__.py' and the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to setup() function parameters, but no untrusted or external data is used in a harmful manner.",
  "flows": "Version info is extracted from a file and then used directly in setup(), long description is read from a file and passed to setup(). No untrusted input flows into executable or sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are present. The regex operation appears straightforward. No obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files to gather package metadata and uses setuptools to configure the package setup. The version is obtained via regex from a file, which is a standard practice. The long description is read directly from the README.md file. All data sources are local files, and the data is passed directly to setup() without manipulation. No external data sources, network operations, or untrusted inputs are involved. The code structure is clear, and no signs of malicious behavior or malicious obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package. It safely loads package metadata from local files and configures the package for distribution. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
