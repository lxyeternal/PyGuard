{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from 'src/pymsgbox/__init__.py' and reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; no network, file writes, or external data manipulation occurring in this code.",
  "flows": "The version string extracted from the __init__.py file flows into the setup configuration; README content flows into long_description. These are read-only data sources used locally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version info securely from a file using regex, avoiding execution of arbitrary code. It reads README content safely for documentation. The setup() function uses standard parameters without any dynamic or insecure operations. No external network calls, credential handling, or code execution occurs. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
