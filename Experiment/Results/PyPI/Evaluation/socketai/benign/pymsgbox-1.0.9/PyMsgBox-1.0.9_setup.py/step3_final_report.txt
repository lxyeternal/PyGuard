  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for packaging the Python module 'PyMsgBox'.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'src/pymsgbox/__init__.py' via regex; reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; only reads local files for package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and README content, then passes data to setuptools.setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup script with straightforward file reads.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static file reads to obtain version and description data, then configures package metadata using setuptools. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The regex used for version extraction is safe and common. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is clear, well-structured, and follows best practices for Python packaging. All signals indicate a benign, standard setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign Python package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, consistent with the code's behavior.",
