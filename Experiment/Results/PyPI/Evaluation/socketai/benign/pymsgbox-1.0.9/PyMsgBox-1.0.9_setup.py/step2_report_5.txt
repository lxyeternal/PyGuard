  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script.\n   - The code reads version info via regex from a local file, which is a common practice.\n   - It reads the README for the long description.\n   - No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as a benign setup script.\n   - No logical flaws or incorrect conclusions are evident.\n   - The reasoning aligns with standard Python packaging practices.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, execute untrusted code, or handle sensitive data.\n   - The regex-based version extraction is safe and standard.\n   - No signs of supply chain attack or malicious payloads.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a typical, safe setup script.\n   - No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n   - The overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' assessments.",
