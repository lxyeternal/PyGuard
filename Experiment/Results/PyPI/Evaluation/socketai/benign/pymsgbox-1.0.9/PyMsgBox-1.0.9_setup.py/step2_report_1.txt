  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the script as a standard setup configuration for a Python package.\n- They emphasize that the code reads version info via regex from a local file and reads a README for long description.\n- No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behaviors.\n- The version extraction via regex is a common practice.\n- Reading static files for setup is standard.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The reasoning in all reports is sound and consistent.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is justified; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0; standard setup script with no security concerns.\n\n### Additional Observations:\n- The regex used to extract version info is safe and standard.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all analyses are based on static code review.\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is benign and follows best practices for a setup script.\n- No modifications needed for scores or conclusions.\n- The detailed reasoning supports that this is a safe, standard package setup script.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat.",
