  "purpose": "Provides cross-platform GUI dialogs for user interaction, including alert, confirm, prompt, and password input functions, based on Tkinter.",
  "sources": "User input via GUI elements such as message boxes, entry fields, and button clicks.",
  "sinks": "Returns user responses; no external data transmission or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "User interacts with GUI elements, leading to response variables being set and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external communication detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Tkinter-based dialogs with optional native Windows message boxes. It handles user input locally, with event bindings and GUI management. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation present. The structure is straightforward, and the logic aligns with benign GUI utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward GUI dialog utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The assigned malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal security concern.",
