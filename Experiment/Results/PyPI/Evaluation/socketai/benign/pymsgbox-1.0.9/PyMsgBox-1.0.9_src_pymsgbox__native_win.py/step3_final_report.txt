  "purpose": "A Windows-specific module that creates native message boxes for alerts and confirmations, wrapping Windows API calls.",
  "sources": "Reads system Python version info; user-controlled parameters for message box content and icons.",
  "sinks": "Calls to Windows API MessageBoxW/A with parameters influenced by user input and code parameters.",
  "flows": "User input (text, button choices) flows into parameters for MessageBox API; responses are mapped back to string labels.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typos in icon and message box constants (e.g., 'MB_ICONERRPR', 'MB_ICONEXCLAIMATION'), but these are benign and do not affect execution or security.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around Windows MessageBox API, with version detection for Python 2/3. It includes fallback to a Python-based alert if parameters such as timeout or tkinter are used. No external data leaks, code injection, or malicious behaviors are present. Typos are minor and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The code does not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoor functions. It is a utility module intended for GUI interactions on Windows systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, utility-focused wrapper around Windows message boxes with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. Minor typos are non-malicious and do not impact security. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate.",
