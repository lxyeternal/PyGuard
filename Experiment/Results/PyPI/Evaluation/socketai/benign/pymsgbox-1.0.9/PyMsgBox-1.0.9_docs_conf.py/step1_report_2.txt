  "purpose": "Configuration script for building documentation using Sphinx for the PyMsgBox project.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and os modules; reads project metadata and configuration parameters for Sphinx documentation generation.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no use of untrusted data sources, external calls, or insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Imports modules without user input; processes static configuration data without external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. All code pertains solely to documentation setup.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file, primarily consisting of static variables and commented guidance. It imports standard Python modules (sys, os) without manipulating them maliciously. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling from external sources is present. The code is well-structured for documentation purposes, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration file for project documentation. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
