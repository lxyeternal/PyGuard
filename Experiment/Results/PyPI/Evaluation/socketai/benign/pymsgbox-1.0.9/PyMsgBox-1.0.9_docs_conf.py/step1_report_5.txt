  "purpose": "Configuration file for building documentation for the PyMsgBox project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`import sys`, `import os`), configuration variable assignments, and comments describing setup.",
  "sinks": "None that perform untrusted data handling or external system interactions; only static configuration setup.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code purely sets configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. The code contains only standard configuration setup and commented instructions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file for documentation. It imports common modules (`sys`, `os`) but does not execute any dynamic or unsafe code. No input/output, network operations, or data processing occurs. The file only defines static configuration variables for documentation generation, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This file is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration script for project documentation. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code appears solely as a typical setup script without security risks.",
