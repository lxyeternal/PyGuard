  "purpose": "This code is a configuration file for Sphinx documentation builder, setting parameters such as extensions, paths, project info, and output options.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and os modules; reads static configuration variables and comments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external communication, or dynamic code execution; only static assignments.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks; purely static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; standard autogenerated configuration comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration script, importing standard modules without executing any dynamic or external code. It contains no network calls, data processing, or obfuscated logic. All variables are static, and comments indicate autogenerated content. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is purely to set documentation build parameters, and it does not handle untrusted input or perform any insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
