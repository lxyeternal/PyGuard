  "purpose": "Client library for managing BigQuery metastore partitions, utilizing environment variables and request parameters for configuration and network communication.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., API endpoints, credentials), request objects, function parameters, external modules.",
  "sinks": "Network RPC calls to Google Cloud APIs, serialization of request data, error handling with credential info.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and function parameters into request construction, which then flows into network RPCs for API interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscation, no backdoors. Use of deprecated methods noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated Google Cloud SDK client library for BigQuery metastore partition management. It handles credentials, environment variables, endpoint selection, and request routing following best practices. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or sabotage signs are present. Environment variables influence configuration but are typical for SDKs. No suspicious data leaks or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure Google Cloud SDK client library with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It adheres to best practices and contains no obfuscation or backdoors. The low risk score (~0.2) reflects standard environment-based configuration, not malicious intent.",
