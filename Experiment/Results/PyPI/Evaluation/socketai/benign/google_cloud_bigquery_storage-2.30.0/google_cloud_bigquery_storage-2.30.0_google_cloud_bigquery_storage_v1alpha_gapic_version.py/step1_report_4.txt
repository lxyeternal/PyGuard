  "purpose": "This code appears to set metadata and licensing information for a Python package, specifically defining the version and licensing details.",
  "sources": "The only sources are comments, metadata variables (__version__) and licensing information; no external data input is read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not perform any data output, network operations, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code simply defines static variables and comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of comments and a version variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package metadata file with licensing comments, versioning info, and no executable logic. No input, output, or potentially malicious constructs are present. It appears to be a standard header or license comment block with minimal code.",
  "conclusion": "There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks in this code snippet. It is standard metadata and licensing information with no active code or suspicious elements.",
