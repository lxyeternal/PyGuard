  "purpose": "This code serves as a license header and version declaration for a Python package, providing metadata and licensing information.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it consists solely of comments and a variable assignment (__version__ = \"2.25.0\").",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects, as the code contains only static comments and a version string.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks exist; the code does not process or transfer data dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard license header with comments and a version assignment. No executable logic, data handling, or external interactions are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. There are no anomalies or suspicious elements. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard license and version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
