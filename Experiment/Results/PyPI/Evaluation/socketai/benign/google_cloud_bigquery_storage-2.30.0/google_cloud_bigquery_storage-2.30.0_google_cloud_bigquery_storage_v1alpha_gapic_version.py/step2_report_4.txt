  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content and Nature:**\n   - The code is purely a license header and version declaration for a Python package.\n   - It contains only comments, licensing information, and a single variable assignment (`__version__ = \"2.25.0\"`).\n   - No executable logic, data processing, input/output operations, or external interactions are present.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n   - No data flows, sinks, or sources that could be exploited.\n   - The code is standard for open-source projects, serving as metadata.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The malware scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The security risk scores are all 0, as expected.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified; there's no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is clear and unobfuscated.\n   - The risk score of 0 is justified; the code poses no security threat.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No issues found that would warrant higher scores.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code snippet is a benign, standard license header and version declaration with no security risks, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The provided reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
