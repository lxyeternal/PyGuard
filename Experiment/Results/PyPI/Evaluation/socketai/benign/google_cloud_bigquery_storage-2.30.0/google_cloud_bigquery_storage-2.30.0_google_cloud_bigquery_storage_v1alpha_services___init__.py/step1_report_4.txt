  "purpose": "The code appears to be a license and copyright notice, with no executable logic or functional code.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data handling points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow present due to lack of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a license comment block with a future copyright year (2025), which is unusual and may suggest placeholder or incorrect metadata; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments specifying licensing information and copyright. There are no executable statements, data processing, or external calls. The only unusual aspect is the copyright year being set to 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date, potentially indicating placeholder text or an error. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is harmless, consisting solely of license comments with no executable or malicious content. The only noteworthy point is the future copyright year, which is likely an oversight or placeholder.",
