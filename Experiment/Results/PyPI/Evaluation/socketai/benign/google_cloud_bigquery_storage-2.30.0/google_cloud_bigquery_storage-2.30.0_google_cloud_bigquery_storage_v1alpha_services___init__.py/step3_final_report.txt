  "purpose": "This code serves as a license header comment, providing licensing information and copyright details.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from comments, which contain licensing and copyright information.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data flows present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the code contains only comments with no executable or data handling logic.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year 2025, which appears to be a placeholder or typo but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a comment block with licensing information, containing no executable code, data handling, or suspicious constructs. The only anomaly is the future year, which does not pose a security risk. All reports correctly identify this as benign, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, with high confidence. No code logic or data flow presents any security concern. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard license header with no malicious or security issues. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent, indicating a benign and safe code fragment.",
