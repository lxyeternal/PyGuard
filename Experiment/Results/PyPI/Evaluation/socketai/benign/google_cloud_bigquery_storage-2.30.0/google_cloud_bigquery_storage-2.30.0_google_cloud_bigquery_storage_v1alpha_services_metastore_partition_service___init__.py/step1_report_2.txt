{
  "purpose": "Module exports for Metastore Partition Service clients (sync and async)",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.async_client and .client)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output mechanisms present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code only imports and exports classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines exports for client classes and imports them from local modules. There are no inputs, user data handling, or network operations. The license header is standard and does not introduce any malicious code. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is present. This is typical boilerplate code for a client library package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module that imports and exposes client classes for a service, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
