{
  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for a client library related to a Metastore Partition Service, likely used for interacting with a data catalog or metadata store.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .async_client and .client.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no input or data reading from external sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Copyright year set to 2025, which is future-dated but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes from relative modules and sets exports. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, or suspicious logic. The copyright statement's year is future-dated but not malicious. The code adheres to typical Python package structure, focusing solely on module interface definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a part of a client SDK for a Metastore Partition Service. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks are detected.",
