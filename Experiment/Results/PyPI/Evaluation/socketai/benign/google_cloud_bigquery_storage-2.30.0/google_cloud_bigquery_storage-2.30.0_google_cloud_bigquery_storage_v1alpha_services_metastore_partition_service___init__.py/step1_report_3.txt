  "purpose": "This code defines exports for a Python package related to a Metastore Partition Service, likely for interacting with a metadata store in a data system.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'async_client' and 'client' modules within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating potential data leaks or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports internal modules and exposes specific classes; there are no data flow paths involving untrusted input or sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The license and copyright comments are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and an __all__ declaration to define public API exports. The licensing comments are standard boilerplate. No dynamic execution, code injection, or malicious behavior evident. No hardcoded secrets or insecure patterns present. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving as part of a package interface.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign module setup for a Python package. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions as a straightforward package interface definition.",
