  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a straightforward module with import statements and an __all__ declaration. No dynamic code, user input, or sensitive data handling.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, which seems appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no security risk.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correctly assessed as benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; simple import/export module.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues found.  \n- **Scores:** Zero scores are appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior or security risks.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern; minimal, standard package interface code.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues detected.  \n- **Scores:** Zero scores are justified.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious or suspicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Again, a simple module with imports and exports.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** Zero scores are appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious or security concerns.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern; no dynamic code, no data handling, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Zero scores seem correct.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or security risks.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, standard boilerplate for module exports.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malware indicators are present.\n- The license year being future-dated (2025) is unusual but not malicious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, given the lack of any security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the consistent benign nature of this code, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews and the code's simplicity.\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is a standard, safe module export pattern with no security issues.",
