{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports specific client classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use, acting as an interface for a client SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .async_client and .client modules, license comments (not functional data sources).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no sinks capable of data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Importing classes from local modules, then exposing them through __all__; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The license header contains a future-dated year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports two classes and defines __all__ for export. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or data handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The license header's future date is noted but not suspicious. All indicators point to benign, boilerplate SDK interface code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard boilerplate for a client SDK module, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify this, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and risk score of 0. The code poses no security concern.",
