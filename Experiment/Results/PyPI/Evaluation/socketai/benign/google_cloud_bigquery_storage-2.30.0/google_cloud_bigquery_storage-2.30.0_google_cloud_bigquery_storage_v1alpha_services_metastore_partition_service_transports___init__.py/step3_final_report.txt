  "purpose": "Registering transport classes for the MetastorePartitionService, setting up a registry of transport implementations.",
  "sources": "Imports of transport classes and the creation of an ordered dictionary to register them.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static registration without data flow.",
  "flows": "Initialization of transport registry with class references; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual license year (2025), but no malicious or suspicious code patterns; no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup module registering transport classes into an ordered dictionary. It imports specific classes and assigns them to keys, with no dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or obfuscated patterns. The license date (2025) is future-dated but likely a placeholder, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is purely organizational, serving as part of a client library setup. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk. The slight elevation in one report's security risk score (0.1) due to the license date is negligible and can be considered an overestimation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard registration module for transport classes, with no malicious intent or security issues. All assessments are accurate; the scores should remain at zero. The unusual license date does not introduce any security concern. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this code is safe.",
