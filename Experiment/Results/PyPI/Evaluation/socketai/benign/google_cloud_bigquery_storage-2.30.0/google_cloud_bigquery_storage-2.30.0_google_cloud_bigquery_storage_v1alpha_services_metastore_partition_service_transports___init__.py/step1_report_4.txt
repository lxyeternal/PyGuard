{
  "purpose": "This code defines and registers different transport classes for a MetastorePartitionService, facilitating communication over gRPC and gRPC asyncio protocols.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (collections, typing, local modules) and reads class definitions and registry entries.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code initializes a registry dictionary and populates it with transport class references; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The license comment states a future date (2025), which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and local modules, creates an ordered dictionary for registry, and adds class references to it. It then specifies the __all__ variable for public API exposure. The license date is set to 2025, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No code executes any sensitive actions, system modifications, or network activity. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module setup for transport class registration, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and functional.",
