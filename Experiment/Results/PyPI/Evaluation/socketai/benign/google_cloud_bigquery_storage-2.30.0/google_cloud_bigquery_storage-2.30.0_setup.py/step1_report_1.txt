  "purpose": "Setup script for the google-cloud-bigquery-storage Python package, handling package metadata, dependencies, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading the version from 'google/cloud/bigquery_storage/gapic_version.py', reading README.rst, and importing dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executing the content of 'gapic_version.py' via exec, which could run malicious code if the file is tampered with.",
  "flows": "Reading and executing version file -> setting package metadata and dependencies -> setup() call with configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code from an external file ('gapic_version.py') instead of safer parsing methods; reliance on external version file increases risk if compromised.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs standard setup operations for a Python package, including reading version info, dependencies, and metadata. The use of 'exec' to execute the version file is a common but risky practice, as it can run arbitrary code if the version file is malicious or tampered with. No other suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The rest of the script involves standard package setup procedures with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical setup script with a potential security concern due to the use of 'exec' on an external version file. If the version file is secure and controlled, the risk is minimal. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected beyond this pattern.",
