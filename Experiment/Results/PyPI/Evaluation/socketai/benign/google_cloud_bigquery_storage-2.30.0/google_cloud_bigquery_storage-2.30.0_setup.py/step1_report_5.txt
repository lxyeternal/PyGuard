{
  "purpose": "This script sets up and configures the 'google-cloud-bigquery-storage' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads the version from 'gapic_version.py' and the README from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data outputs or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and documentation files, then passes data to setuptools.setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors detected. The only dynamic code execution is reading and executing a version file, which is standard for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard package setup operations, such as reading version info, package discovery, dependency specification, and configuration of setup parameters. The version is dynamically loaded via exec(), which is common in setup scripts. No user input, network connections, or suspicious code constructs are present. The script adheres to typical packaging practices and does not exhibit signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard practices without any suspicious activities.",
