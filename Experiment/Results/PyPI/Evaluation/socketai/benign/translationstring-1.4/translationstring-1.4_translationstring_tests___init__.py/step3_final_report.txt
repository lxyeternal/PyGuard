  "purpose": "This code is a placeholder comment indicating a package, with no executable logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only a comment line.",
  "sinks": "None; no data or untrusted input is processed or output.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow exists due to lack of code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only a comment, indicating a non-functional stub or incomplete file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single comment '# package' with no logic, data sources, sinks, or flows. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the minimal, placeholder nature of the code. Confidence levels vary but are justified based on the simplicity of the snippet. No anomalies or suspicious activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-functional placeholder with no security or malicious concerns. The scores are consistent with its minimal content. No modifications are necessary; the overall security risk is negligible.",
