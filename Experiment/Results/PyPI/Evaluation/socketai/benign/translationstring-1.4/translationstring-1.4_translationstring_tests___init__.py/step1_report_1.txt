  "purpose": "The code is a placeholder or incomplete snippet labeled as 'package' with no actual implementation or functionality provided.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are read in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No data or untrusted inputs are processed or sent to any output sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present due to the lack of implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a comment with the word 'package' and no actual code or logic, which is unusual and indicates it may be a placeholder or incomplete.",
  "analysis": "The provided code fragment consists solely of a comment indicating 'package' with no functional code, variables, or logic. Without any executable content, there are no data sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. The absence of code makes it impossible for any malicious behavior or security issues to be present, but it also provides no meaningful functionality to review.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an incomplete or placeholder snippet with no functional content. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. Due to the lack of actual code, the overall risk is negligible, but the code is non-functional as provided.",
