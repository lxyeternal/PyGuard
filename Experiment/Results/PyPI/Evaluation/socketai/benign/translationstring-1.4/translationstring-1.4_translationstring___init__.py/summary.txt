  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate internationalization utility with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The primary risk relates to the interpolation mechanism if used with untrusted data, but this is a common and controlled pattern in translation libraries. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code is safe for deployment."
