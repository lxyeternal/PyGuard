{
  "purpose": "The code provides translation string handling, including interpolation, policy-based translation, and factory functions for internationalization support.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as msgid, default, mapping, and translation objects; internal regex for interpolation.",
  "sinks": "Translation functions and interpolation methods; no external system calls or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from msgid/default through translation string creation, optional interpolation, and policy-based translation lookups.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex for string interpolation could be misused if provided with malicious mappings, but no code injection or malicious activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard i18n utility with safe regex usage for string interpolation. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation are detected. The interpolation regex is used solely for string replacement, not code execution. The functions handle translation strings, policies, and factories securely, with no external network or file operations. The only potential concern is misuse of the interpolation method with untrusted input, which is a known risk in translation utilities but not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate internationalization utility with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The primary risk relates to the interpolation mechanism if used with untrusted data, but this is a common and controlled pattern in translation libraries. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code is safe for deployment.",
