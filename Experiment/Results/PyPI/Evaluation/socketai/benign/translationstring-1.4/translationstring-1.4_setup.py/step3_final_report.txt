  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python library, configuring metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' and 'changes.rst' files, package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows, network activity, or external data leaks.",
  "flows": "File reads during setup, static package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling during file reading, which can mask errors but is common in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script for packaging Python modules. It performs static configuration tasks without dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation. The broad try-except blocks are standard but could hide errors; however, they do not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external data flows are present. The code's purpose is solely package setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard packaging configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
