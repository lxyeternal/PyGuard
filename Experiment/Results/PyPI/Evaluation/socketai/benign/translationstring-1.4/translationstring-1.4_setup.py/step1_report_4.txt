  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library related to internationalization (i18n).",
  "sources": "Reading README and CHANGES files, importing setup and find_packages modules, defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no external data or inputs are processed during execution.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; the script only reads static files and sets up package info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading documentation files, defining package metadata, and invoking setuptools setup(). All operations involve static files or predefined data. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or sensitive data handling. The exception handling for file reading is broad but benign, defaulting to empty strings if files are missing. No signs of malicious activity or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior detected. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious or malicious code.",
