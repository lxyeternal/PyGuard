{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for packaging and distributing a Python library related to internationalization.",
  "sources": "Reading README and changes files, importing os and setuptools modules, package discovery with find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output functions that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations; package metadata and file reads are static or controlled.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling during file reads could mask errors, but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs static setup tasks: reading files, defining package metadata, and invoking setuptools.setup(). No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation observed. The exception handling for file reads is overly broad but not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code, external data flows, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present. It does not perform any malicious operations or contain hidden backdoors.",
