{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'README.rst' and 'changes.rst' for long description; importing modules; defining package data and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that execute untrusted data or lead to data leaks; no network or system command execution.",
  "flows": "File reading operations used to gather package descriptions; no flow from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a broad except block without specific exception handling; no explicit hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: importing modules, reading documentation files, defining package info, and calling setup(). No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The try-except block for reading files is generic but not malicious. No external or network operations are performed. No obfuscated or malicious logic found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to configure package distribution.",
