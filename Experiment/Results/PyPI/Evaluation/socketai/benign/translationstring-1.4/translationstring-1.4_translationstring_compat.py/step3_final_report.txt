  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities for string types and unicode handling across Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info used to determine Python version; input parameter 's' in function u(s).",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Version check leads to defining type aliases and the u() function; 's' passed to u() in Python 2, identity in Python 3.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, standard compatibility shim.",
  "analysis": "The code detects Python version at runtime and defines string type aliases and a unicode conversion function accordingly. It employs common patterns for cross-version compatibility without handling untrusted data, external inputs, or performing any malicious operations. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious logic are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. The code's purpose is purely to facilitate compatibility, with no indications of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign compatibility utility for Python 2/3 support. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified.",
