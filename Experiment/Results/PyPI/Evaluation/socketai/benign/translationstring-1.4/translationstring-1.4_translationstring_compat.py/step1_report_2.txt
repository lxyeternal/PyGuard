  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard compatibility setup with no suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code detects Python version and sets type aliases accordingly, including a compatibility function u() for Unicode strings. No user input, external data sources, or data leaks are involved. The code is straightforward, using common compatibility patterns for Python 2/3 support.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard Python compatibility boilerplate with no malicious intent or security risks.",
