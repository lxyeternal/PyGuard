  "purpose": "Define compatibility utilities for handling string types across Python 2 and Python 3.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info and the input string 's' in the function u(s).",
  "sinks": "None present; no data sinks or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Input string 's' flows through the function u(s), which adjusts encoding depending on Python version.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. The version check and string handling are standard compatibility practices.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version and defines 'string_types', 'text_type', and a function 'u' for unicode conversion to ensure compatibility. It uses sys.version_info to detect Python version, then defines 'u' accordingly. No data is read from untrusted sources, no data is sent externally, and no malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The code is straightforward and serves a compatibility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard compatibility code for handling string types between Python 2 and 3. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks.",
