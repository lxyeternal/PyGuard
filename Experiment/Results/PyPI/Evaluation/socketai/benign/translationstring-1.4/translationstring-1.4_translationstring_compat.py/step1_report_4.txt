{
  "purpose": "The code defines compatibility shims for string types and unicode handling between Python 2 and Python 3.",
  "sources": "Reading Python version information via sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects; no untrusted data handling or external outputs",
  "flows": "Retrieval of Python version info -> defining string type aliases -> defining a unicode function based on Python version",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; standard compatibility code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version to set up string type aliases and a unicode conversion function for cross-version compatibility. It uses sys.version_info to determine the environment. No external data input, no data processing that could lead to leaks or malicious actions. The code is straightforward and standard for maintaining compatibility, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign compatibility code with no malicious intent or security concerns. It correctly handles Python 2 and 3 differences without performing any dangerous operations.",
