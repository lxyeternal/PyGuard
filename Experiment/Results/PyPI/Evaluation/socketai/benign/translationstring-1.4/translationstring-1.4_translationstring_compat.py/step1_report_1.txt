{
  "purpose": "The code defines compatibility shims for handling string types and unicode across Python 2 and Python 3 environments.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version information from sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems",
  "flows": "Uses version info to select appropriate string types and define a unicode function u(s)",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code determines Python version at runtime and defines type aliases and a unicode conversion function accordingly. It uses standard practices for cross-version compatibility. No external data is read other than sys.version_info. No untrusted input or data leaks are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common compatibility patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for maintaining compatibility between Python versions. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
