  "purpose": "Helper functions for reading and managing Google Cloud SDK's configuration and credentials, including obtaining project ID and access tokens.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ), system paths (os.path), subprocess outputs (subprocess.check_output), and configuration files (credentials path).",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_output calls (executing gcloud commands), environment variable reads, file path constructions, and returning access tokens or project IDs.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or system paths -> subprocess commands (gcloud CLI) -> outputs processed and returned as project ID or access token.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard use of subprocess to call CLI commands, no hardcoded secrets or credentials (besides a fixed client ID which is expected), and no obfuscated code or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly manages configuration paths depending on OS, executes gcloud CLI commands to retrieve project IDs and access tokens, and handles environment variables for config directories. subprocess calls are used securely with stderr ignored or captured, and no untrusted input is directly executed. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The fixed client ID is standard for Google OAuth clients, not malicious. The overall structure is straightforward and consistent with normal SDK helper functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate helper functions for Google Cloud SDK configuration management. It securely interacts with the system environment and subprocess calls to retrieve credentials and project information. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attack signs are evident.",
