  "purpose": "Helper functions for reading Google Cloud SDK's configuration, credentials, project ID, and access tokens via subprocess calls and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, configuration file paths, subprocess calls to gcloud CLI commands.",
  "sinks": "Execution of trusted gcloud CLI commands, parsing their output.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (environment variables, file paths) lead to subprocess execution, whose output is processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; subprocess calls are standard for SDK helpers.",
  "analysis": "The code provides legitimate utility functions for managing GCP SDK configurations. It uses environment variables and OS-specific paths to locate credentials and config files. Subprocess calls invoke trusted gcloud commands, with stderr suppressed or captured securely. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code handles exceptions properly and follows standard practices. The only minimal concern is subprocess reliance, which is typical in such helper modules. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard helper module for Google Cloud SDK configuration management. No signs of malware, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects the minimal inherent risk of subprocess execution in trusted environments. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy.",
