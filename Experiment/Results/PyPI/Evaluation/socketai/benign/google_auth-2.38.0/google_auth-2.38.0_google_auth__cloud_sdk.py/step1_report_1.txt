  "purpose": "Helpers for reading the Google Cloud SDK's configuration, managing credentials, and retrieving project and access tokens.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (CLOUD_SDK_CONFIG_DIR, APPDATA, SystemDrive), os functions (os.path, os.environ, os.name), subprocess commands (gcloud CLI), local configuration files.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_output (executing gcloud commands), os.path.join (file path access), environment variables (reading configuration paths).",
  "flows": "Environment variables → subprocess commands (gcloud CLI) → output parsing and returning credentials or project info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; subprocess calls are to trusted gcloud commands; no suspicious dynamic code execution; standard use of environment variables and subprocess. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and uses them for managing configuration and credentials via environment variables, file paths, and subprocess calls to gcloud CLI. It retrieves configuration paths based on environment variables or default locations, then fetches project ID and access tokens by executing gcloud commands. All subprocess commands are executed with controlled arguments, and outputs are processed securely. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code is straightforward and appears to serve legitimate configuration management purposes for Google Cloud SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for managing Google Cloud SDK configurations and credentials with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It performs expected operations securely, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage.",
