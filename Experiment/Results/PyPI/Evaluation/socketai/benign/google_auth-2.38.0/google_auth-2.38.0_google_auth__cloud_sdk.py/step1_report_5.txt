{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for reading and managing Google Cloud SDK's configuration, including retrieving project ID, credentials path, and user access tokens.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (CLOUD_SDK_CONFIG_DIR, APPDATA, SystemDrive), user home directory, subprocess command outputs.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess command execution results, environment variables read for configuration paths, returned project ID, credentials path, and access tokens.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → get_config_path → subprocess commands → get_project_id and get_auth_access_token → return values",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; subprocess commands are used to retrieve sensitive information but are executed securely with stderr suppressed. No obfuscated or unusual language features. Code appears straightforward and consistent with typical SDK helper functions.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves configuration paths and tokens through environment variables, subprocess calls, and helper functions. No malicious payloads or backdoors are present. It handles different OS environments and exceptions properly. Use of subprocess for command execution is standard for CLI integrations. No suspicious code patterns or anomalies observed. No indications of malware or malicious intent; the functions aim to facilitate legitimate SDK configuration access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard helper module for managing Google Cloud SDK configurations and credentials. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain threats. All subprocess and environment variable usages are consistent with expected SDK functionality, and no suspicious activity is evident.",
