  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions within the google.auth package. They emphasize that there are no data flows, external inputs, network operations, or suspicious behaviors. The consistent conclusion across all reports is that the code is benign, standard, and poses no security or malware risks.\n\n**Step-by-step evaluation:**\n\n1. **Code presence and correctness:**\n   - The code matches the description: it defines multiple exception classes, inheriting from Python's built-in exceptions or other custom exceptions.\n   - No external data reading, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - The properties such as `retryable` are straightforward and correctly implemented.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The class structures are standard, and the code follows typical Python exception class patterns.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n3. **Scores and their appropriateness:**\n   - Malware score: 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated score: 0, also appropriate.\n   - Risk score: 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The reports' confidence is high (1), and their conclusions are justified.\n\n4. **Potential vulnerabilities or malicious behavior:**\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities are made, and the code does not support such claims.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are warranted here.\n\n5. **Consistency and justification:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The code's purpose is purely for error handling, with no security implications.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the comprehensive analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, benign exception hierarchy with no security or malware concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores should remain at zero across all categories.",
