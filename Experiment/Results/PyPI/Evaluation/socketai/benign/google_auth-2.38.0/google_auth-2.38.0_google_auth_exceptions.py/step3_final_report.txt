{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling within the google.auth package, facilitating specific error identification and management.",
  "sources": "No external data input, network communication, or dynamic code execution; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external sinks or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class inheritance with properties.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various exception types, inheriting from Python's built-in exceptions or other custom exceptions. Properties like 'retryable' are simple boolean flags. There are no external inputs, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. The code adheres to standard Python exception class patterns, with no obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious code. The purpose is purely for error categorization within the package, posing no security or malicious threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard exception hierarchy with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, well-structured error handling module. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0.",
