  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely defining exception classes for error handling.\n- No external input, data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to standard Python practices.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The purpose is to provide custom exceptions for the google.auth package, which is typical and safe.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not read external data, write to external sinks, or process untrusted input.\n- The properties and initializations are simple, with no complex logic.\n- The exception hierarchy is standard, with no anomalies or suspicious behaviors.\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Scores and justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified; the code is purely for error handling and poses no security threat.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe code is a typical exception hierarchy for a Python package, with no issues related to supply chain security or malicious behavior.",
