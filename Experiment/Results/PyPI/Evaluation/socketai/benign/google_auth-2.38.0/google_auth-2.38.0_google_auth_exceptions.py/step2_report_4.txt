  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Hidden Code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to the google.auth package. There are no signs of external data input, network activity, code obfuscation, or dynamic behavior that could be malicious. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns or security risks. No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code or behavior.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign a risk score of 0, aligning with the conclusion that the code is safe and contains no vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's static analysis, which is appropriate here.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores with the Analysis:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided. Given the code's nature, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, benign exception hierarchy with no security issues.**",
