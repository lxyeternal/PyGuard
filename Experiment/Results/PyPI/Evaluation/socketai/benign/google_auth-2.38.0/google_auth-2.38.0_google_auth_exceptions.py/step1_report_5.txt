  "sinks": "Exception instantiations, especially with potential message strings, property accessors.",
  "flows": "Error occurrences lead to exception instantiation and propagation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a series of custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception types, designed to handle various error conditions in the google.auth package. The only dynamic behavior involves initializing exceptions with messages and properties, such as 'retryable'. There are no external input reads, network operations, or data leaks. The class structures and properties are straightforward, focusing solely on error representation. No obfuscated or malicious code, no suspicious data handling, nor any code that could perform malicious actions is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of exception class definitions for error handling in a Python package. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
