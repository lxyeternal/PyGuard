  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the google.auth package.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input data directly; all classes are definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points where untrusted data could cause vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes and properties.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; the code follows standard exception class patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to authentication errors in the google.auth package. It uses typical Python inheritance from built-in exception classes and defines properties like 'retryable'. No external data input, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured exception hierarchy meant for internal error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes for error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and does not introduce security risks. It is safe and standard in its design.",
