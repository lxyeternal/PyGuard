  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the google.auth package to handle various error scenarios.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources; the code only defines classes and methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external output actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code consists solely of class definitions and initializers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for error handling within the google.auth library. Each class inherits from Exception or other custom exceptions, with some including additional properties like 'retryable'. There are no external inputs, network communications, or sensitive data handling. The code structure is standard and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely for defining exception classes related to authentication errors and contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its intended purpose.",
