  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the google.auth package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions and exception instantiations; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; the code only defines exception classes and properties.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code contains only class definitions and simple initializations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; exception class definitions are standard. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes used in the google.auth package. It includes standard class constructors, properties, and inheritance from Python's built-in Exception and other error types. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or obfuscated constructs. The code appears to be a typical exception module for error handling, with no signs of malicious intent, hidden behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for a Python package. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior, no backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious activity. It is safe and intended for error handling within the package.",
