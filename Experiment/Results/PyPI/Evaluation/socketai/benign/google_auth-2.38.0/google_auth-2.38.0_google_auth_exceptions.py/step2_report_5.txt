  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to the google.auth package.\n- No external data input, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The classes follow standard Python inheritance patterns, with properties like 'retryable' defined appropriately.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose is clearly to facilitate error handling within the package, not to perform any malicious activity.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. The code is purely defining exception classes, with no malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward, readable, and adheres to standard patterns.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable. There are no vulnerabilities or security risks inherent in defining exception classes.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that there are no data flows, external inputs, or network interactions.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- The code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical exception hierarchy for internal error handling, with no malicious or suspicious features. The assessments and scores in the reports are justified and correct.",
