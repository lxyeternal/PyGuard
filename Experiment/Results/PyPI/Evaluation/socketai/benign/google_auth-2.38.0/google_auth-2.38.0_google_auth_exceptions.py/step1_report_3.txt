  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the google.auth package.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external sinks or performs network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code primarily defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class definitions without unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets. No obfuscation or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions used for error handling within a Python package. No input parsing, data processing, or network interaction occurs here. All classes inherit from Exception or other custom exceptions, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign set of exception class definitions used for error handling in the google.auth package. It poses no security risks or malware threat. The code is standard and does not contain any malicious behavior.",
