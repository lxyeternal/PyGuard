{
  "purpose": "This module provides functionality for downscoping Google Cloud credentials using Credential Access Boundaries, enabling restricted access to resources via short-lived tokens.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user-provided rules, resource identifiers, permissions, and optional conditions when constructing access boundary rules and availability conditions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are token exchange requests to the STS endpoint, where credentials are exchanged and tokens are issued, and the token refresh process that retrieves and updates access tokens.",
  "flows": "Flow begins with creating rules and a credential access boundary, which are used in the Credentials class to request token exchanges with the STS service, resulting in downscoped tokens that are stored as class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; code uses standard Google auth libraries and patterns for credential management. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions to create Credential Access Boundaries, add rules, and perform token exchanges securely via Google's STS endpoint. It correctly validates input types and values, adheres to API specifications, and uses standard libraries without obfuscation. The token exchange process involves proper handling of token expiration. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Usage aligns with documented Google Cloud practices for credential downscoping.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for managing downscoped credentials using Credential Access Boundaries, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It employs proper validation and secure token exchange mechanisms, indicating a safe, well-structured module.",
