{
  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions for creating downscoped Google Cloud credentials using Credential Access Boundaries and token exchange.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.auth, google.oauth2, and standard datetime; class constructors and methods reading/using parameters like rules, resource names, permissions, expressions, tokens.",
  "sinks": "Calls to external services (STS token exchange endpoint); use of source credentials to generate tokens; conversion of rules to JSON for API requests.",
  "flows": "Source credentials are refreshed, then an exchange_token request is made to an external STS URL, passing in rules and tokens; the response provides a downscoped access token.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious network domains beyond legitimate Google API URLs; no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors; proper validation of parameters; no code injection or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for managing Credential Access Boundaries and downscoped credentials, including validation and JSON serialization for API compatibility. The main security concern is the external token exchange request, which is standard for this flow and uses provided, validated inputs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network interactions are present. Proper parameter validation and usage of Google's libraries mitigate risks. Overall, the code performs legitimate credential management operations aligned with Google Cloud security practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of Google Cloud credential downscoping using Credential Access Boundaries and token exchange. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It properly validates input, interacts securely with Google's token services, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code.",
