{
  "purpose": "This code implements credential downscoping for Google Cloud Storage using Credential Access Boundaries, enabling restricted, short-lived access tokens for specific resources and permissions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from source credentials during refresh and token exchange processes, and from user-provided rules and conditions.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with Google's STS token exchange endpoint, and serializes access boundary rules into JSON for API requests.",
  "flows": "Source credentials are refreshed, then their tokens are exchanged via the STS endpoint to generate downscoped tokens, which are then used for resource access; rules and conditions flow into JSON payloads for API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; validation enforces limits and types appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code follows documented Google Cloud practices for credential downscoping, validating input rules, and securely interacting with Google's STS API. It does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Validation ensures rules are within limits and correctly typed. The token exchange process is standard, and the code uses official libraries. No signs of malicious behavior or security flaws are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of credential downscoping for Google Cloud Storage, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external API interactions, which are standard for this functionality.",
