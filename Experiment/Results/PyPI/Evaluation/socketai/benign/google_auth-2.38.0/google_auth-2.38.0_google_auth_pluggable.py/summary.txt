  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign but relies heavily on external scripts, which could be malicious if compromised. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness and validation of external commands and outputs. The malware score should be low (around 0.2), reflecting supply chain risk rather than embedded malicious code. The security risk remains high due to external command execution without validation. Obfuscation is not present. Proper validation, sanitization, and environment controls are essential to mitigate risks."
