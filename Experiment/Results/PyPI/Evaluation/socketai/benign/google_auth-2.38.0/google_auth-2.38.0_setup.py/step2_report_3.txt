  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the setup script's role; sources are static files and version.py.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or sensitive flows.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code; standard setup.py pattern. The use of `exec` to run version.py is common, assuming the file is trusted.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior, benign, high confidence (0.9).  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 (very low, justified by standard practices).  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard package setup with no suspicious code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.0.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Also confirms standard setup script, with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 (slightly higher, but still very low).  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Similar findings; standard setup script, uses `exec` for version.py, which is common.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 (still very low).  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Confirms standard setup with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.0.  \n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation.  \n- **Use of `exec`?**  \n  While `exec` can be risky if the version.py is malicious, in the context of package setup, this is a common pattern, assuming the source files are trusted.  \n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  No evidence of vulnerabilities, backdoors, or data exfiltration.  \n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The malware scores are appropriately zero across all reports, as there's no malicious activity detected.  \n- The risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code. Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are acceptable, given the use of `exec`, but overall, the risk remains minimal.  \n- The obfuscated score is zero, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.  \n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** Given the standard nature and no suspicious activity, I would set it at **0.1** to reflect the minor concern about `exec`, but it's acceptable at 0.1 or 0.2.  \n\n### Summary:\n\nBased on all reports, the code is a typical, benign setup script with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My final estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1  \n\nThis aligns with the evidence and standard practices in package setup scripts.",
