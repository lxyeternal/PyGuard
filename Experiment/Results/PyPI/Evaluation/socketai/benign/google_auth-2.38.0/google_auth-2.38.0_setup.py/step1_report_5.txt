{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package called 'google-auth', managing dependencies, package data, and metadata for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long description, reading version information from 'google/auth/version.py'.",
  "sinks": "No unsafe data sinks; no network, file writing, or execution of untrusted data observed.",
  "flows": "Reading external files (README.rst, version.py) which are trusted sources; no data flow involving untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; standard setup.py pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script using setuptools. It reads project metadata, dependencies, and package data. No dynamic execution of untrusted code, no network activity, and no potential data leaks. The only notable dynamic aspect is reading and executing version.py, which is a common pattern for version management. All dependencies are standard and declared explicitly. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate setup script for a Python package. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It simply manages package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
