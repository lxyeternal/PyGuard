  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'google-auth', performing package configuration, dependency declaration, and version retrieval.",
  "sources": "Reads static files 'README.rst' and 'version.py' to obtain long description and version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Reads static files; executes 'version.py' via 'exec' to assign version variable.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'exec' to evaluate 'version.py', which could be risky if the file is malicious, but is a common pattern in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py for packaging a Python library, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The only dynamic code execution is 'exec' on 'version.py', which is standard but could pose a risk if the file is compromised. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned across reports are consistent, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and very low security risk (~0.1), justified by the controlled use of 'exec'. The code's structure and content indicate a benign, well-understood pattern for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The minor concern about 'exec' is acceptable in a trusted environment. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
