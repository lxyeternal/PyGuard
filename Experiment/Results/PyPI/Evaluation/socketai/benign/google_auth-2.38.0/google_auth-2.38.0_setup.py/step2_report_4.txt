  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for a Python package.\n- No report indicates any suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- The only minor concern is the use of `exec()` to run `version.py`, which is common but could be risky if the file is compromised. However, in a controlled environment, this is standard practice.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscated code, or malicious data flows.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code is straightforward and matches the description in all reports.\n- No issues or anomalies are present that would suggest malicious activity.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The use of `exec()` to execute `version.py` could be considered a minor security concern if the file is compromised, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts and not inherently malicious.\n- No other errors or flaws are evident.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign very low or zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No report suggests any reason to assign a higher risk score.\n- The minimal risk associated with `exec()` is acceptable here, given the controlled environment and the nature of the code.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- The reports correctly identify that this is a standard setup script with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (as per reports, acceptable for minor concerns)\n- **Overall:** The code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis supply chain report correctly identifies the code as benign. The only potential minor concern is the use of `exec()` for version assignment, which is common and generally safe if the source file is trusted. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious data flows exists.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The scores are appropriate; no changes needed. The code is safe for use and distribution.",
