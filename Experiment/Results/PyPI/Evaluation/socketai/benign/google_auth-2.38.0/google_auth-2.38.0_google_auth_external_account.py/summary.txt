  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured credential management module with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and inherent to credential exchange processes but not malicious. The initial reports' scores are accurate; a slight adjustment of the risk score to 0.1 is recommended for consistency. Overall, the code poses no supply chain or malicious threat."
