{
  "purpose": "Implementing exponential backoff algorithms for retry mechanisms, both synchronous and asynchronous, to be used as utility classes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; uses standard library modules and imported exceptions from google.auth.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no output or network operations involving untrusted data; functions are purely computational and sleep-based.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of backoff objects → iteration (__iter__ or __aiter__) → retries with jitter → sleep and wait for next attempt.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of random.uniform for jitter introduces variability but not maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for exponential backoff, allowing retries with jitter to prevent thundering herd problems. It includes both synchronous and asynchronous implementations, with configurable parameters. No malicious or malicious-looking behavior, code injection, or data leaks are evident. The usage of random for jitter is standard practice and not suspicious. No external network connections or credential handling are present. The code appears as a typical utility module for retry logic with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of exponential backoff utilities with no malicious intent or suspicious features. It is suitable for inclusion in production systems where retry logic is needed.",
