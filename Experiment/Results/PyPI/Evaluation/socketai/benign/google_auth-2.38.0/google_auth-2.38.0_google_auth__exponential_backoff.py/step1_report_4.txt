  "purpose": "Implementation of exponential backoff algorithms for retry mechanisms, including both synchronous and asynchronous versions.",
  "sources": "Imports asyncio, random, time, and google.auth.exceptions; reads configuration parameters for retry behavior.",
  "sinks": "Uses random.uniform for jitter calculation, time.sleep and asyncio.sleep for delays.",
  "flows": "Initialization of backoff parameters (source) -> calculation of jitter (sink) -> sleep delays (sink) during iteration (source to sink)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No suspicious or unusual code structures detected. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides classes for implementing exponential backoff retry strategies with configurable parameters. It uses randomness to jitter delays, which is standard for such mechanisms. No external data inputs, user inputs, or insecure behaviors are observed. The only notable activity is delaying execution via time.sleep and asyncio.sleep, which is typical in backoff algorithms. The code appears well-structured, documented, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of exponential backoff logic for retrying operations, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It is safe and typical for handling retries with configurable jitter. No security risks or suspicious behavior are detected.",
