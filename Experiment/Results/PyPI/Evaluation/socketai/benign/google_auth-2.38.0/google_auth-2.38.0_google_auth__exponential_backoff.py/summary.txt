  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of exponential backoff with jitter, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; minor adjustments suggest setting the security risk score to 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident."
