  "purpose": "Implementing exponential backoff algorithms for retry mechanisms in synchronous and asynchronous contexts, primarily used to handle transient failures such as network errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'google.auth.exceptions', which are used for exception handling. Usage of 'random.uniform' for jitter calculation. No external or untrusted data sources detected.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'time.sleep' and 'asyncio.sleep' for introducing delays. No data leaks or untrusted data processing detected.",
  "flows": "Initialization of backoff parameters -> Iteration over backoff attempts -> Calculation of jitter -> Delays between retries.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code employs standard practices for implementing exponential backoff. No hidden or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for exponential backoff retry mechanisms with configurable parameters such as total attempts, initial wait, jitter, and multiplier. It uses 'random.uniform' for jitter and 'time.sleep'/'asyncio.sleep' for delays. Exception handling is limited to raising 'InvalidValue' if total_attempts < 1. The code appears well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior or privacy violations. It does not perform network operations or system modifications beyond adding delays, which are typical in retry logic. Usage of the 'google.auth.exceptions' is limited to exception raising, not used to read sensitive info.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of exponential backoff retry logic, both synchronous and asynchronous. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious network activity. It appears safe and legitimate, serving its purpose for robust retry mechanisms.",
