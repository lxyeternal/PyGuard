{
  "purpose": "Implement an exponential backoff utility for retrying operations with configurable parameters, including synchronous and asynchronous versions.",
  "sources": "Constants defining retry parameters; class constructors reading configuration arguments; random.uniform() for jitter calculation; sleep functions for delay.",
  "sinks": "time.sleep() and asyncio.sleep() introduce delays; no untrusted data inputs or outputs are evident; no external network or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Class instantiation reads configuration -> iteration (__iter__/__aiter__) resets state -> __next__/__anext__ methods compute jitter -> sleep delays -> backoff count increments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code, code injections, or misleading variable names; use of random.uniform for jitter is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation of exponential backoff algorithms with configurable parameters, including jitter to avoid thundering herd effects. It employs standard libraries (asyncio, random, time) and does not perform any network or file operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or hidden backdoors. The use of randomness and sleep functions aligns with common retry strategies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for handling retries with exponential backoff, both synchronously and asynchronously. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks within this code segment.",
