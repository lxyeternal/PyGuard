{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a utility for exponential backoff with jitter, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous retries.",
  "sources": "Sleep functions (`time.sleep()`, `asyncio.sleep()`), parameters for retries and jitter, validation of total_attempts.",
  "sinks": "Sleep delays used internally; no external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Source parameters influence jitter calculation and sleep delays; no external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard use of libraries and practices; no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard exponential backoff with jitter, validating input parameters, and providing both sync and async iterators. It uses common libraries (`random`, `time`, `asyncio`) and performs no external network or data handling. The jitter calculation is typical, and the sleep functions are standard for retry mechanisms. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code is well-structured, documented, and aligns with best practices for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of exponential backoff with jitter, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; minor adjustments suggest setting the security risk score to 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
