  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'workdays' Python package, providing package metadata and description.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are used in this code; it is a static setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script purely defines package metadata and instructions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; standard setup script with well-known modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'distutils.core.setup' to define package metadata and description. All fields are static strings or lists, with no user input, external data, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. The URLs point to a GitHub repository and are used for package distribution references. The script is straightforward and conforms to typical Python package setup conventions. There are no signs of malicious activity or security issues within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely defines package metadata for distribution and has no suspicious or harmful code components.",
