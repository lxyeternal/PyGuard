{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'workdays' that extends datetime functionalities with workday calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata from hardcoded strings and variables in the setup() function arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; all data appears static and intended for package distribution.",
  "flows": "The static data flows from the setup() function arguments to the package metadata during installation or building.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns observed. The code consists solely of a standard setup() call with package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script imports distutils.core.setup and calls it with hardcoded package information such as name, version, description, author, and URLs. All data appears static and intended for package publication. There are no user inputs, network operations, or code execution based on external data. The structure is typical of Python package setup scripts, with no suspicious behavior or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup configuration with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains only static metadata for publishing a Python package. Therefore, the likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
