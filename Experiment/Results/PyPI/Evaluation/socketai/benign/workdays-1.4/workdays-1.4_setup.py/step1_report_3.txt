  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'workdays' Python package, including metadata and description.",
  "sources": "Imports from distutils.core and the setup() function call with package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, external data processing, or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only contains static setup metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a setup script using distutils to specify package metadata such as name, version, description, author info, URLs, keywords, classifiers, and long description. There are no external data inputs, user inputs, or dynamic code execution. The script appears to be a standard package configuration with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a typical package configuration for distribution. It contains no malicious code, no external data flows, and poses no security risks.",
