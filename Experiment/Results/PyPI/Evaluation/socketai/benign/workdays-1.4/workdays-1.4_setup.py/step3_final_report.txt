{
  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata for distribution using Python's distutils, including name, version, description, author info, URLs, keywords, classifiers, and a long description. It serves to facilitate the packaging and distribution process.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields such as name, version, description, author, URLs, keywords, classifiers, and long_description.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data that could lead to leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the script only declares static metadata without runtime data processing or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a standard setup script with no suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static setup script for a Python package, containing only hardcoded metadata. It does not perform any dynamic operations, input handling, or external data interactions. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present. All indicators point to a benign, conventional package configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports correctly identify its static and safe nature. Therefore, the malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0.",
