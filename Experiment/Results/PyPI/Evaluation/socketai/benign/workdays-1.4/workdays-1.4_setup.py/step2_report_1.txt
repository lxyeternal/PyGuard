  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of the code:**\nThe provided code is a straightforward Python package setup script using `distutils.core.setup`. It defines static metadata such as package name, version, description, author info, URLs, keywords, classifiers, and long description. There are no dynamic behaviors, no external data inputs, no code execution beyond static configuration, and no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is static and conventional.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors or mistakes?**  \n  None identified. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices. No mistakes or security flaws are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code. No reason to adjust this.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports correctly identify the code as not obfuscated (score 0).\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports give a risk score of 0 or 0.5, with some at 0. Confidence in the benign nature supports a risk score of 0.\n\n### Justification for risk score:\n- Since the code is a static setup script with no external dependencies, no code execution, and no obfuscation, the risk score should remain at **0**.  \n- A score higher than 0.5 would imply some potential security concern, which is not supported here.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities.  \n- The URLs point to GitHub, but there is no indication of malicious content there from this script alone.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis setup script is entirely benign, serving only to define package metadata for distribution.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, non-malicious Python package setup script with no security risks, obfuscation, or malware. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
