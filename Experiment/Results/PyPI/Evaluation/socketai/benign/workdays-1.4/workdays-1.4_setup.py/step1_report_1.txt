{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'workdays', providing utility functions related to working days calculations.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from the package metadata fields such as 'name', 'version', 'description', 'author', 'author_email', 'url', 'download_url', and 'keywords'. It does not read external input or data during execution.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks that could lead to data leaks or external effects. It only sets up package metadata and description.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows, as this is a static setup script that does not process input or execute logic beyond defining package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors present. The script strictly adheres to standard Python packaging conventions without obfuscation, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward package setup script using 'distutils.core' to define package metadata. It does not contain code that reads untrusted input, writes to external systems, or performs any actions beyond static configuration. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The package appears to be a utility library for date calculations, with no embedded code that could be malicious or harmful.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and serves its purpose of defining package metadata for distribution.",
