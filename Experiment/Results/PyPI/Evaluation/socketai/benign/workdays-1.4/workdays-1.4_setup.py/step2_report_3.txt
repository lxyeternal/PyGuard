  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package.\n- No external input, dynamic code, or runtime data processing is involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code only defines static package metadata and does not perform any operations beyond that.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None of the reports identify any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports indicate the code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risks:** Given the static nature and lack of external data processing, the risk is effectively zero.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign a risk score of 0 or 0.5; since there's no malicious activity, 0 is justified.\n\n**Any discrepancies?**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- The code is a typical package setup script with no malicious or security issues.\n- The malware score should be **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n- The risk score should be **0**, as there's no security concern.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and poses no security risk.\n- The scores provided in the reports are reasonable and should remain as they are.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nNo further action needed.",
