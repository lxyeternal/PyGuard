{
  "purpose": "Provide functions to calculate working days between dates and move dates by a number of workdays, considering weekends and holidays.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as start_date, end_date, holidays, and days; internal date manipulations and comparisons.",
  "sinks": "Return calculated number of workdays, and modified date objects; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input dates and holidays are processed to determine workdays; date adjustments based on weekends and holidays; results returned as date objects or integers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks; usage of standard date manipulation functions; no obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs date calculations related to working days, considering weekends and specified holidays. It uses standard datetime operations, list comprehensions, and straightforward control flow. No external network, file operations, or environment variable usage present. No suspicious or malicious code detected. The functions are logically structured for their purpose, with no signs of malicious intent or covert behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for calculating working days and adjusting dates accordingly. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The functions rely on standard library features and follow typical patterns for date calculations.",
