  "purpose": "Calculate working days between dates, accounting for weekends and holidays, and compute workday offsets.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: start_date, end_date, holidays, days; external data such as dates and holidays.",
  "sinks": "Return values: number of workdays, adjusted date calculations.",
  "flows": "Inputs (dates, holidays) influence calculation of workdays and date adjustments; no external network or sensitive data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or malicious code patterns, no external data leakage, and no suspicious system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard date calculations for working days, considering weekends and holidays. It uses basic arithmetic, list comprehensions, and date manipulations. No code injection, network activity, or system modifications are present. All functions are straightforward and focus on date logic. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The functions are self-contained, with no external dependencies beyond Python's datetime library.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate date calculations related to working days and scheduling, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks.",
