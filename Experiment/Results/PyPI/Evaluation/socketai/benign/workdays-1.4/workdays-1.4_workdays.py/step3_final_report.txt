  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to calculate working days between dates and to shift dates by a specified number of workdays, considering weekends and holidays.",
  "sources": "Reads input dates as datetime objects; processes holiday lists containing datetime objects.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions return computed datetime objects based on input data.",
  "flows": "Input dates and holiday lists flow through date calculations; no external or network data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard date calculations for business days, handling weekends and holidays appropriately. It uses Python's datetime module, list comprehensions, and control flow to adjust dates and count workdays. No external dependencies, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The functions are logically correct, handle edge cases, and do not contain vulnerabilities or malicious payloads. The code's purpose is utility-based, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for date calculations related to workdays. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The assigned malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting its utility nature. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent.",
