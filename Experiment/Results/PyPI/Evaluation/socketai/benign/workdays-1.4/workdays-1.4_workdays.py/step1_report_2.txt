{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to calculate working days and workdays offset for date ranges, considering weekends and holidays.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: start_date, end_date, holidays, days, and optional data read from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Return values: number of working days, computed dates; no direct untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (dates, holidays, days) are used to compute outputs through date arithmetic, with no external or network data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The logic is straightforward date calculations. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. The holidays list is filtered, but not dynamically sourced or tainted from external input. The functions do not perform any network operations or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script defines constants for weekdays, and functions to calculate working days between two dates and to compute a new date offset by a number of workdays, considering weekends and holidays. It handles edge cases such as holidays on weekends and adjustments for starting on weekends. The code uses standard date arithmetic, with no indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No external data sources or sinks, no use of eval, exec, or network operations. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscation or hidden mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for date calculations related to working days, with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It handles holidays and weekends properly and contains no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
