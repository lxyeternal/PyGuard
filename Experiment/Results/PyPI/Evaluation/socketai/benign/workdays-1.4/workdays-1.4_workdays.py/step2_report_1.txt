  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's security implications, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code provides utility functions (`networkdays`, `workday`) to calculate working days between dates and to shift dates by a specified number of workdays.\n- It handles weekends and holidays, filtering out non-working days.\n- Uses standard Python `datetime` library; no external or network dependencies.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, straightforward date calculations, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0.\n- **Logic correctness:** The code correctly computes workdays, handles holidays, weekends, and edge cases.\n- **Malware/security risk:** None detected.\n- **Score justification:** The low risk score (0.1) aligns with the absence of security concerns.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, confirms legitimacy, no suspicious code, high confidence (1.0), malware score 0.\n- **Logic correctness:** The functions correctly handle holidays, weekends, and date shifts.\n- **Malware/security risk:** None.\n- **Score justification:** No malicious activity, security risk remains minimal.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, straightforward date utility functions, no malicious indicators, confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n- **Logic correctness:** The functions are consistent and handle edge cases.\n- **Malware/security risk:** None.\n- **Score justification:** The low security risk is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous assessments, no suspicious behavior, high confidence, malware score 0.\n- **Logic correctness:** Functions perform expected date calculations.\n- **Malware/security risk:** None.\n- **Score justification:** No concerns.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion, benign utility code, no malicious activity, confidence 1.0, malware 0.\n- **Logic correctness:** Proper handling of date calculations.\n- **Malware/security risk:** None.\n- **Score justification:** No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The code is purely date calculation logic, with no network, file I/O, or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or suspicious behavior, a low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Aspect             | Score |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Malware            | 0      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      |\n| Security Risk      | 0.1    |\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is a standard, transparent implementation of business day calculations.\n- No vulnerabilities, malicious payloads, or obfuscation detected.\n- The minimal security risk score accounts for the fact that, as a utility, it could be misused if integrated into a malicious system, but on its own, it is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and the scores are reasonable. I concur with the assessments and suggest maintaining the low malware and obfuscation scores, with a very low security risk score reflecting the utility nature of the code.",
