  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward implementation of calculating network days and adjusting dates based on holidays and weekends.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, justified given the benign nature.\n- **Logical issues:** None identified; the code performs standard date calculations.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, confirming the code's legitimacy as a date utility.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Logical issues:** None.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Also confirms the code's legitimacy, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Logical issues:** None.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, straightforward date calculations.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Logical issues:** None.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—benign date utility functions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Justification:\n\n- **Code Presence:** The code is present and matches the description—it's a standard date utility for calculating working days and adjusting dates.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0, as there's no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the nature of the code—pure date calculations without network, file I/O, or external data leaks—the risk scores are appropriately low (mostly 0 or 0.1).\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's functionality.\n- No adjustments needed; the code is benign.\n- The high confidence levels across reports support this conclusion.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering minimal risk from potential misuse, but given the benign code, 0 is more appropriate)\n\n**In conclusion, this code is a legitimate, straightforward utility for date calculations with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.**",
