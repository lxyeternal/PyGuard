  "purpose": "Calculate working days and workday adjustments considering weekends and holidays.",
  "sources": "Input parameters start_date, end_date, holidays, and optional days; internal datetime operations.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data being output or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input dates (start_date, end_date, holidays) are processed through date calculations; no data is transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or obfuscated logic; straightforward date computations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for calculating network days, comparing dates, and shifting dates considering weekends and holidays. It uses standard datetime operations and list comprehensions without involving external inputs or unsafe operations. No data leaks, malicious network calls, or code injections are present. The functions operate purely on datetime objects and perform logical date manipulations. The code appears to serve a utility purpose for calendar calculations without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign date utility library designed to compute working days and adjust dates accounting for weekends and holidays. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. All operations are safe, straightforward, and consistent with typical date handling routines.",
