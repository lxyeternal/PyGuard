  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a set of date utility functions for calculating workdays and adjusting dates considering weekends and holidays.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, uses standard Python datetime operations, and lacks any suspicious or malicious constructs.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Checks:\n- **Code correctness:** The functions `networkdays` and `workday` implement standard algorithms for calculating working days and date adjustments, considering weekends and holidays.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No input validation or external data handling that could lead to security issues. The code relies on trusted datetime objects.\n- **Scores:** The assigned scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Specific observations:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly higher in some reports (0.1), but given the code's utility nature and lack of external dependencies, 0 or 0.1 are reasonable.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- The confidence levels are high, which is justified.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk score:** 0.1 (maximum) — given the code's utility nature, this is acceptable, though it could be 0 for complete benignity.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very low, considering it's a date utility library with no external interactions)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate, and free of malicious intent. The scores in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.",
