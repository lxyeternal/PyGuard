{
  "purpose": "The code calculates workdays and dates based on given date ranges, holidays, and weekends.",
  "sources": "Reads input dates, holidays, and the number of days to shift in functions 'networkdays' and 'workday'.",
  "sinks": "Returns computed number of workdays or adjusted dates; no untrusted data sinks such as network or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "Input dates and holidays flow into calculations to determine workdays and adjusted dates without external untrusted data outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Use of standard library functions with no hidden dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard date calculations for workdays, respecting weekends and holidays. It uses common control flows and arithmetic operations. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious logic detected. No network activity or system commands are invoked. Functions are straightforward and utilize Python's datetime module appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of date calculations for business days and date adjustments. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious actions or data leaks.",
