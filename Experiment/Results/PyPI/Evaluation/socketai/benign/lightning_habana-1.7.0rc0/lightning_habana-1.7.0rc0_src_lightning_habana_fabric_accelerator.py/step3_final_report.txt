  "purpose": "Hardware abstraction layer for Habana HPU devices, managing device setup, validation, detection, and registration within ML frameworks.",
  "sources": "Imports from torch_hpu, _parse_hpus, device_count functions, and device info retrieval methods.",
  "sinks": "Device info functions such as get_device_name(), setup_device validation, and registration; no external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (device info) flow into validation and parsing functions; device info retrieved and registered locally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward hardware management module for Habana HPUs, utilizing standard APIs and exception handling. It performs device validation, info retrieval, and registration without network activity or data exfiltration. All signals indicate benign, intended functionality. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard hardware abstraction layer for Habana HPUs with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores are appropriate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
