  "purpose": "Environment validation and dependency version checks for Habana Labs, Torch, Lightning, and related libraries.",
  "sources": "Version info from get_hpu_synapse_version(), torch.__version__, and import statements for required modules.",
  "sinks": "No external data handling, network communication, or untrusted input processing.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and availability flags, compares versions to set environment flags.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward dependency and environment validation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard environment setup tasks: importing modules, checking package versions, and verifying resource availability. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. All version comparisons and resource checks are typical for setup scripts. No external data or untrusted inputs are processed, and there are no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the benign nature of environment validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment validation script with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
