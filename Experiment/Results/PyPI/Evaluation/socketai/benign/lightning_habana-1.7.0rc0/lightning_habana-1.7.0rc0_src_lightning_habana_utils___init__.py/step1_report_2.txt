  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided, as the code content is missing. Unable to determine the exact purpose.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the user input (e.g., input functions), environment variables, and potentially external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output functions, network transmission points, or file writing operations, which could leak or modify data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like output functions, network calls, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identifiable due to missing code content. The code structure and format appear standard without obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "Since the actual code content is not provided, the analysis cannot identify specific source, sink, or flow points. Based on the instruction, the absence of code prevents detection of malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are observable without code details.",
  "conclusion": "Without the actual code, a definitive assessment cannot be made. The lack of code prevents detection of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears standard and unremarkable in structure.",
