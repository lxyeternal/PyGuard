{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes from the 'lightning_habana' library related to strategies for Habana Labs hardware, and defines the module's public interface.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'lightning_habana.fabric.strategies' modules, which load classes related to hardware strategies.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific strategy classes from a library related to Habana Labs hardware. It defines the __all__ list to specify what is exported when the module is imported. There are no functions, no data handling, no network calls, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and aligned with typical Python package practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely imports specific classes and defines exports, with no indicators of malware, backdoors, or security issues.",
