{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define an API for importing and exporting specific classes related to Habana Labs' hardware strategies within the Lightning framework, likely for distributed training configurations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'lightning_habana.fabric.strategies' modules for various strategy classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports classes and defines an export list, with no data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and conforms to typical Python module structure.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific classes from the 'lightning_habana.fabric.strategies' package and exposes them via '__all__'. There are no sources of untrusted data, no data processing, and no sink points for sensitive or malicious actions. It serves as a module index or API entry point. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a Python package, defining the public interface with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
