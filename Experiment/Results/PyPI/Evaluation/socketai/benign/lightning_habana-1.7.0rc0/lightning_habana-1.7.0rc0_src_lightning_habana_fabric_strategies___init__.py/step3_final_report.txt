{
  "purpose": "This code module imports specific strategy classes from the 'lightning_habana.fabric.strategies' package and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'lightning_habana.fabric.strategies' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or data processing involved.",
  "flows": "Import statements to module exports; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ list, serving as a module setup for exposing classes. It contains no dynamic code, data processing, network activity, or user input handling. The structure is standard and benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup for exposing hardware strategy classes. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
