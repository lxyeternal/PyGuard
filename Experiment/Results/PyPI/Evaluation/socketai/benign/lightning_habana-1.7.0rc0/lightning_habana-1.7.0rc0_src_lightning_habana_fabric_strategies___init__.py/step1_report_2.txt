{
  "purpose": "The code defines imports and exports related to Habana Labs' strategies for distributed and parallel training within the Lightning framework, specifically for Habana accelerators.",
  "sources": "The code reads static module imports from 'lightning_habana.fabric.strategies' submodules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated or unusual code behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward, importing specific strategy classes from the 'lightning_habana' package and defining an __all__ list for module exports. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or external communications. The code is consistent with typical module setup in a Python package, focusing on organizational imports and exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely organizational, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It functions as part of a larger framework to expose Habana-specific strategies for use elsewhere.",
