{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for querying Habana HPU device information, including version, device name, and memory statistics, as well as modifying JSON configuration files.",
  "sources": "External system commands ('hl-smi', 'hl-smi -v', 'hl-smi -L') and JSON files on disk.",
  "sinks": "JSON file write operations and subprocess calls that execute system commands.",
  "flows": "System commands are executed via subprocess, outputs are parsed with regex, and data is used for device info or written to JSON files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads detected. Use of subprocess calls is standard for hardware info retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with hardware management utilities and performs JSON modifications with proper exception handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. Subprocess calls are typical but could be exploited if the environment is compromised; however, this is a common pattern for such utilities. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), justified by reliance on external commands but consistent with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs legitimate hardware management functions without malicious intent. The low security risk score is appropriate given the context. No evidence of sabotage or malicious behavior is present.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
