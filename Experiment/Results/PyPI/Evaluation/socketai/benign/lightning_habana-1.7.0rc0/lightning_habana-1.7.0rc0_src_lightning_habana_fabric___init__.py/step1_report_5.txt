{
  "purpose": "To define and expose modules related to Habana Labs' hardware acceleration strategies and plugins for integration with a machine learning framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'lightning_habana.fabric' package, which load specific classes and functions related to Habana hardware and strategies.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not process untrusted data or include network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs module imports and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes from a Habana Labs-related package and defines an '__all__' list for exports. It contains licensing information and import statements only. No data inputs, outputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution observed. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's module initializer or API definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily consisting of import statements and an export list for a package. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code detected.",
