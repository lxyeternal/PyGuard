{
  "purpose": "This module imports specific classes and functions from the 'lightning_habana.fabric' package and defines an __all__ list for public API exposure.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'lightning_habana.fabric' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network communication, or data processing present.",
  "flows": "Import sources are directly assigned to the __all__ list; no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The __all__ list includes 'HPUFSDPStrategy' which is not imported or defined in the code snippet, indicating a potential typo or inconsistency.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API export module with only import statements and an __all__ list. No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing occurs. The only notable anomaly is the inclusion of 'HPUFSDPStrategy' in __all__, which is not imported or defined, potentially leading to runtime errors but not malicious intent. The code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module exporting classes related to Habana Labs hardware acceleration strategies. The only issue is a likely typo in the __all__ list, but this does not indicate malicious activity or security risks.",
