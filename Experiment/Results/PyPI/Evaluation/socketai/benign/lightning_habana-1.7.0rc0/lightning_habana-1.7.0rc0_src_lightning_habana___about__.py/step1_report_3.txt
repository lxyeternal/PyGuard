  "purpose": "Define metadata for a Python package related to Lightning AI's support for Intel Habana accelerators.",
  "sources": "No external data input or untrusted data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that could leak information or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static metadata assignment without data flow or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward metadata definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns package metadata attributes as string literals, which is standard for Python modules. The __all__ list explicitly exports selected attributes. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity present.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists solely of static metadata definitions for a Python package. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
