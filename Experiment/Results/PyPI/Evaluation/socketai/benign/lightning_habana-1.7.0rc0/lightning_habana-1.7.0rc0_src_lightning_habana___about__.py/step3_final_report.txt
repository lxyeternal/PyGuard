  "purpose": "Static package metadata declarations including version, author, email, license, copyright, homepage, docs, and __all__ list.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals assigned to module-level variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Static assignments from code to variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. There are no dynamic behaviors, input handling, external data fetching, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or anomalies are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, static package metadata declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. All reports are accurate and justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
