  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for a Python package, including version, author, license, and documentation info.",
  "sources": "None; all data are static string assignments and list definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; all variables are statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or obfuscated elements are present. The code is straightforward metadata assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata variables with static values, including version info, author details, license, and project description. The data are hardcoded and do not involve any dynamic input or external data processing. No code execution, data handling, or network communication occurs. The code is structured as typical Python module metadata, with no suspicious patterns or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting solely of static metadata declarations for a Python package. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
