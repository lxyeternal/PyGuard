  "purpose": "Defines metadata for a Python package/module related to Lightning support for Intel Habana accelerators.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting module-level metadata variables (__version__, __author__, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data being sent or processed insecurely",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static metadata assignments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward metadata definitions, no obfuscated or unusual code structures",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static string values to module-level variables that describe the package. There are no inputs, no processing of external data, and no dangerous code execution. All variables are hardcoded with benign metadata information. No suspicious activity or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign metadata definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
