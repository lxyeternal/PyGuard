  "purpose": "Define metadata for a Python package related to Lightning support for Intel Habana accelerators.",
  "sources": "Module-level variables assigning strings, such as __version__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __homepage__, __docs__, and __all__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no network, file, or environment variable access observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets static string variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is standard metadata declaration with no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata variables in a straightforward manner. There are no dynamic code executions, no input reading, no external data sources, and no sink operations. All variables contain static string literals providing package information. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package metadata definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
