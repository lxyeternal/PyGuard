  "purpose": "Define package metadata including version, author, license, and documentation details for a Python package related to Lightning support for Intel Habana accelerators.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments for package metadata (__version__, __author__, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks present; no data leakage points or untrusted data processing observed",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from source to sink; simple assignment statements with static data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. Metadata is standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments defining package metadata, such as version, author, email, license, and homepage. All data is static, hardcoded strings, with no dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data fetching. No suspicious or malicious activity is present. The structure and content follow common Python package conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard metadata declaration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and correctly formatted.",
