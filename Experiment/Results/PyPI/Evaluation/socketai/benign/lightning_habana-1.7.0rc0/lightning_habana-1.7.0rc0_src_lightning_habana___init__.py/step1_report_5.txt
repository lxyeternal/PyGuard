{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and configures Habana Labs' PyTorch/Hypothesis acceleration strategies and plugins for use in a larger machine learning framework, with version checks and conditional imports.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), compare_version, import statements, environment variables, conditional import logic, __all__ list",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data flows or external data leaks identified",
  "flows": "The code flow involves version checking, conditional imports based on framework availability, and exporting symbols for external use; no dangerous data flow paths detected",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present. Usage of standard libraries and explicit licensing info suggests normal operation.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs version checks, conditional imports, and defines module exports. It verifies environment versions, imports modules accordingly, and sets a boolean indicating hardware availability. All actions are standard and do not involve untrusted input, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, focusing on initializing Habana hardware acceleration components and compatibility checks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as a typical setup script for a Python package supporting Habana hardware with proper licensing.",
