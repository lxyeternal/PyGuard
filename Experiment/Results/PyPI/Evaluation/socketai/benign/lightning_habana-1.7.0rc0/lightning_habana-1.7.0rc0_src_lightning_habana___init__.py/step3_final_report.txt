  "purpose": "Initialization and environment validation for Habana hardware support within PyTorch Lightning, including version checks and conditional imports.",
  "sources": "Module imports, version comparison functions, environment variables, and hardware availability checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; primarily local environment checks and module imports.",
  "flows": "Version checks and conditional imports based on environment variables and hardware detection; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from ... import *' in the __about__ module, which is common but can obscure imported symbols; no malicious or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks: importing modules, verifying package versions, checking hardware availability, and setting flags accordingly. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The use of 'import *' is typical in __about__ modules and not suspicious. Version checks and environment detection follow common practices. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate, standard initialization script for Habana hardware support in PyTorch Lightning. No malicious activity or security risks are present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
