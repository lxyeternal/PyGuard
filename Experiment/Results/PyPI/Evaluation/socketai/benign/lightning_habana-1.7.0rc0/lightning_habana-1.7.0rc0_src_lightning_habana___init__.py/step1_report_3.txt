{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and configures Habana Labs' hardware acceleration tools, imports various modules, checks for package version compatibility, and determines Habana hardware availability.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), compare_version function, imported modules and their attributes, is_habana_available function",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input are present in this code",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; version checks and hardware availability checks are straightforward and not influenced by external untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are present. The code performs standard imports, version comparisons, and feature detection.",
  "analysis": "The code performs initial setup tasks: importing modules, performing version compatibility checks, and verifying hardware availability. It uses version comparison functions and conditional imports, which are standard practices. No evidence of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or backdoors, is detected. The code structure and logic are clear, and it does not execute any untrusted or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard initialization and setup script for Habana Labs' hardware acceleration framework. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malicious code, or suspicious anomalies. Its purpose is to facilitate hardware and software environment configuration safely.",
