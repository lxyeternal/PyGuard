  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate package setup configuration with minimal security concerns. The primary risk is the dynamic execution of external files without validation, which could be exploited if files are tampered with. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the security risk is modest at 0.3 to account for the dynamic loading pattern. Overall, the code is safe if source files are trusted."
