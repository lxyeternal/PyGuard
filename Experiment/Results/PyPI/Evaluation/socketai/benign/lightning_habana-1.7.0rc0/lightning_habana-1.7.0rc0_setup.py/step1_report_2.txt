Usage of standard setuptools setup procedures.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code performs standard setup operations: loading metadata from a local module, reading requirements and README files, preparing extras from requirement files, and configuring package metadata for distribution. All file reads are from local, controlled sources. No dynamic code execution beyond standard module loading occurs. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or obfuscated logic is present. The functions are straightforward and intended for package configuration. The presence of functions to load modules and requirements from the filesystem is typical in setup scripts, with no indication of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package. It only reads static files, loads module data, and prepares package metadata. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this code.\",\n  \"confidence\": 1.0,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.\n}",
