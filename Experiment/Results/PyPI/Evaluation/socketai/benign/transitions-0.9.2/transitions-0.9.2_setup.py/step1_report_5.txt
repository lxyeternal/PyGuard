  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'transitions' Python package, including reading version info, preparing long description, and specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'transitions/version.py'; reading 'README.md'; checking 'sys.modules' for 'setuptools'.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sinks or external command execution.",
  "flows": "Reading version file -> setting package info; reading README.md -> processing description; checking sys.modules for 'setuptools' -> modifying extras_require.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec(f.read())' on version file is a potential risk if the file contains malicious code; otherwise, it's a common pattern for dynamic versioning. No other suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs setup configuration tasks: reading version info via 'exec', sanitizing README content with regex, and setting dependencies based on the environment. The use of 'exec' could be risky if the version file is compromised, but in typical package workflows, this file is controlled. No network operations, credential handling, or obfuscated code present. Overall, the script appears standard for a Python package setup, with a minor concern regarding 'exec'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with minimal security concerns. The only notable point is the use of 'exec' to evaluate the version file, which, if the version file is tampered with, could execute malicious code. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior in the provided code.",
