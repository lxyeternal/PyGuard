  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python project, defining dependencies, reading version info, and preparing distribution metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'transitions/version.py' via exec(), reads README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or credential handling.",
  "flows": "Version info is loaded by executing the contents of 'version.py'; README content is processed for description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info, which could be risky if 'version.py' is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks with minimal security concerns. The use of exec() to load version info is common but could be exploited if the version file is malicious. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with a minor security concern related to executing external code for versioning. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The supply chain risk is minimal, and the scores reflect that.",
