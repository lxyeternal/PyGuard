  "purpose": "This module provides asynchronous state machine functionality, including states, transitions, events, and timeouts, using asyncio for concurrency.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from event_data objects, callback functions, and transition conditions; also from environment variables or external modules if callbacks are specified via strings.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could be introduced through callback functions, transition conditions, or externally supplied callback strings, which may be executed without sanitization. No explicit data leakage or malicious data exfiltration points are directly evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (event data, callbacks, conditions) through various async methods (e.g., trigger, execute, check) and is processed by callbacks or condition functions, with state changes and timeout handling as effects. There is no evidence of untrusted data being sent over networks or malicious external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses dynamic callback resolution and async tasks management, which could be misused if callbacks are maliciously supplied as strings, but this is standard for flexible callback invocation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are found.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a complex asynchronous state machine framework with support for states, transitions, events, nested states, and timeouts. All functionality appears to be legitimate for a state machine library: it manages callbacks, handles async timing, supports nested transitions, and manages transition queues. The only potential concern is the dynamic resolution of callbacks from strings, which could allow executing malicious code if external strings are maliciously provided. However, this is a common pattern in callback-driven frameworks and does not inherently indicate malicious intent. There are no network connections, data exfiltration, or reverse shells present. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads. It is designed for safe asynchronous state management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured asynchronous state machine implementation intended for general use. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware signatures are evident. The only minor risk is the dynamic callback resolution, which depends on how callbacks are supplied—if external inputs are sanitized, this risk is minimal. Overall, the code appears safe and intended for legitimate purposes.",
