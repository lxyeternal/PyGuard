{
  "purpose": "The code implements an asynchronous state machine framework with support for states, transitions, callbacks, nested states, and timeouts, designed for flexible and concurrent state management.",
  "sources": "Event data, current model state, transition conditions, callback functions, configuration parameters, and external inputs such as callback strings or callables.",
  "sinks": "Callback functions invoked during state entry/exit, transition execution, timeouts, and event processing; potential for malicious callbacks if supplied untrusted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from event triggers into condition checks, callback executions, state changes, and timeout handling, often involving dynamic resolution of callback functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; use of dynamic callback resolution is standard but warrants validation if inputs are untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard asyncio patterns for concurrency, with well-structured classes for states, transitions, and events. Callback invocation via dynamic resolution introduces potential risk if callbacks are malicious, but this is typical in plugin systems. No embedded malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall risk is low, approximately 0.2, primarily due to reliance on external callback functions. The code's design is mature and aligns with best practices for async state management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured async state machine framework with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is ensuring callback functions are validated and trusted, as external callbacks could be malicious if supplied from untrusted sources. Overall, the code itself is safe, with a low risk profile, and no embedded malware detected.",
