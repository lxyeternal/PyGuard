  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scoring consistency, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides an async state machine framework, with no malicious payloads or obfuscation. It relies on user-supplied callbacks and conditions, which could be malicious if untrusted, but the code itself is standard.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No evidence of malicious behavior, network activity, or sabotage embedded in the code.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No obfuscation detected; code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2  \n  *Justification:* The primary risk stems from executing external callbacks, which could be malicious if supplied untrusted functions. The code itself does not perform malicious actions.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns well with the code content. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the extensive async features, nested states, and callbacks. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present. The `_DictionaryMock` class is noted as slightly unusual but benign.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* Clear code, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2  \n  *Justification:* Same as above; risk depends on external callback functions.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the use of asyncio, callback execution, and timeout management. No malicious network activity or backdoors. The dynamic callback invocation could be a vector if callbacks are malicious, but this is standard.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No malicious payloads or behaviors.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2  \n  *Justification:* External callback functions could be malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, emphasizing the async features, callback handling, and timeout support. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No malware or sabotage detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2  \n  *Justification:* Risks are external callback-related.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the legitimate design, with no malicious activity. Notes the dynamic callback resolution as a potential vector if external inputs are malicious, but standard in such frameworks.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No signs of malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* Clear code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2  \n  *Justification:* External callback functions could be malicious if untrusted.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Code Presence:** The code is present and functional as described.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malware or obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Scores:** All reports assign a low risk (0.2), justified by reliance on external callbacks, which is standard in callback-based frameworks.\n- **Behavior & Logic:** No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or network activity.\n- **Potential Concerns:** The only vector for malicious activity would be malicious callbacks or condition functions supplied externally. This is inherent to callback systems and not specific to this code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** (low, based on external callback execution, which is standard but should be validated in practice)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured asynchronous state machine framework with no embedded malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of externally supplied callback functions, which is a common consideration in callback-driven systems. Proper validation and sandboxing of callback functions are recommended in deployment, but the code itself is safe.",
