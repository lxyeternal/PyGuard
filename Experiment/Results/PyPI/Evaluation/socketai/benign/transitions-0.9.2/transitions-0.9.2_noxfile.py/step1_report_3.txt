  "purpose": "Automated testing configuration using nox for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads dependencies from requirements files, installs packages, and runs tests.",
  "sinks": "The code executes shell commands via session.run, which could execute untrusted code if installed packages or test files are malicious.",
  "flows": "Dependencies are installed from requirement files, followed by test execution via shell commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears to be a standard test automation script. No obfuscation or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The script configures nox sessions for testing with specified Python versions. It installs dependencies and runs pytest on test directories. No user input, data leakage, or suspicious network activity is observed. The code relies on external files for dependencies and test scripts, which should be reviewed separately, but within this fragment, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate automated testing setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this fragment.",
