{
  "purpose": "Define and run testing sessions for a Python project using nox, including checks for manifest, mypy type checking, and pytest-based tests.",
  "sources": "Static code analysis, no external input sources or untrusted data reads.",
  "sinks": "Execution of shell commands via session.run, installation commands via session.install.",
  "flows": "No external untrusted data flows; the code executes controlled install and test commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. No use of dynamic execution or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up multiple nox sessions for testing purposes, installing dependencies, and running tests. It uses predefined Python versions, installs packages from requirements files, and runs test commands. There are no indications of data leakage, malicious payloads, or malicious code behavior. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and consistent with typical testing automation scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard nox configuration for running tests and checks, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It functions as intended for development workflows.",
