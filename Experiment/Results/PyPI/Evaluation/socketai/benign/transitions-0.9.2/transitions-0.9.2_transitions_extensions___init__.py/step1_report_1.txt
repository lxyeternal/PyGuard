{
  "purpose": "This code provides imports for various transition extension classes related to state machine functionality, including diagrams, nesting, locking, and asyncio support.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.diagrams, .nesting, .locking, .factory, .asyncio)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external interactions present in the code",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports modules without data flow logic",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; standard import structure with optional asyncio support",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs module imports to extend state machine capabilities. The use of try-except for optional asyncio imports is standard for compatibility. No dynamic execution, data handling, or external network activity is present. No indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import setup for transition extensions. No malicious or security risks identified.",
