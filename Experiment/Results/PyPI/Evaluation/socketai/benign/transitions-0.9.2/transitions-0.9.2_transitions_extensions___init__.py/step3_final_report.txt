  "purpose": "Module setup for state machine extensions, importing various classes and functions for hierarchical, threaded, and diagrammatic state machines.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.diagrams, .nesting, .locking, .factory, and conditional from .asyncio).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; no network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Import statements executed at module load; no data flow or dynamic execution beyond imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import pattern with conditional asyncio support.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module import setup with documentation. It conditionally imports asyncio modules for Python 3 compatibility, which is a common pattern. There are no data handling, external communications, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The code serves as an extension point for a state machine library, with no malicious or security-related behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements and documentation. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified.",
