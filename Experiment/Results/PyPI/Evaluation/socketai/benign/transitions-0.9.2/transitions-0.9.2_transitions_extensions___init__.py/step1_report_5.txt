  "purpose": "This code provides imports for various extension modules of a state machine framework, including hierarchical, graphical, threading, and asynchronous features.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports modules from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or security-sensitive actions are performed.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external input; the code only sets up imports for internal modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behavior are present. The conditional import for asyncio modules appears standard for optional Python 3 features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import structure for a Python package, with comments explaining functionality. It uses standard import practices and a typical try-except block for optional modules. No malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an extension import setup for a state machine library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
