  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules (.diagrams, .nesting, .locking, .factory, and conditionally from .asyncio).\n- It includes a docstring describing the purpose of the module.\n- The only conditional logic is a try-except block to import asyncio-related modules if available, which is standard for Python 3 compatibility.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is purely import statements with documentation; no data handling, external interactions, or dynamic code execution.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logic or reasoning errors:** None. The code structure and pattern are typical for a Python package's extension module setup.\n- **Security flaws:** None. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.\n\n### Scores Given in Reports:\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1 (or very close to it)\n- These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since the code only performs imports and documentation, and there's no data processing, external communication, or dynamic execution, **risk scores should remain at 0**.\n- Any higher score would imply potential malicious activity or vulnerabilities, which are not present here.\n\n### Malware Score:\n- All reports correctly assign **malware = 0**.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, so this is justified.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is standard, benign import setup.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made, and none are evident.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign and poses no security threat.**\n\n---\n\n### Additional Recommendations:\n- No changes needed; the current scoring and analysis are appropriate.\n- For completeness, I would reaffirm that the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk, given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- The code is a straightforward module import setup for a state machine extension library.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The current scores are justified and should remain unchanged.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **malware:** 0\n- **obfuscated:** 0\n- **risk:** 0",
