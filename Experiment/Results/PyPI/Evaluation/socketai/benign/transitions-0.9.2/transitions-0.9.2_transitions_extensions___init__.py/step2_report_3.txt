  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily a set of import statements, with conditional imports for Python 3 asyncio support.\n- No untrusted data handling, external network activity, or data flow is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- The use of try-except for optional modules is standard practice for compatibility.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is a straightforward module setup for a state machine extension library.\n- The only dynamic element is the conditional import, which is common and benign.\n- No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious logic are present.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n- The reports are consistent and justified in their assessments.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**My own evaluation:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward import statements)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a benign, standard setup for a Python package extension, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep the scores as they are: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- No further action needed based on this code snippet.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a simple, well-structured module import setup with no malicious or security issues. The reports' assessments are correct.",
