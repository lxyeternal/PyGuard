{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for importing various extension modules related to state machine functionality, including diagrams, nesting, locking, and asynchronous operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads only from its own module imports; no external input sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform any data output, network operations, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; this module only imports classes and modules without processing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. Use of try-except for optional Python 3 features is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes from submodules, some conditionally based on Python version. There are no signs of malicious code or malicious behavior. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's extension interface, with no obfuscated code or suspicious logic. The only dynamic element is the conditional import, which is common for compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign extension module for a state machine library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
