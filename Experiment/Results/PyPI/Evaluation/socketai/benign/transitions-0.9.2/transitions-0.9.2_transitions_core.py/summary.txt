  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, non-obfuscated state machine framework that relies on dynamic import and method resolution, which could be exploited if callback or module strings are influenced by untrusted sources. No active malicious code or sabotage is evident. The current scores are appropriate, with a moderate risk level reflecting the potential for code injection if inputs are compromised. Proper input validation and whitelisting are recommended to ensure safe operation."
