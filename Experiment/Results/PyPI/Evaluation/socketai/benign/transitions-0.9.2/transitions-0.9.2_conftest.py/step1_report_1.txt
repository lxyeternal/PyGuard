  "purpose": "Configure pytest to only run async tests if necessary modules are available",
  "sources": "Import statements, specifically the try-except block that checks for asyncio and contextvars modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data effects; the code only influences test collection behavior",
  "flows": "Import check (source) influences the decision in pytest_ignore_collect (sink) to skip certain tests based on module availability",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard conditional import pattern used to determine feature availability",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the presence of asyncio and contextvars modules, setting a flag (WITH_ASYNC). The pytest_ignore_collect function uses this flag to skip certain test files if async support is unavailable. The implementation is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, code injection, or malicious behavior observed. No external data is read or written in a harmful way; it solely controls test collection based on environment capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration script for pytest, intended to skip async tests if the environment does not support required modules. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are present.",
