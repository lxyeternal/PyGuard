  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward pytest configuration that conditionally skips async tests if `asyncio` and `contextvars` modules are unavailable.\n- The code employs a try-except block to detect module presence, setting a boolean flag `WITH_ASYNC`.\n- The `pytest_ignore_collect` function uses this flag and the filename to decide whether to skip certain tests.\n- No report indicates any suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- The code relies solely on standard library modules and standard practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. All reports accurately describe the code's behavior: conditional test skipping based on environment capability detection.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The logic is straightforward, standard, and correct for the purpose described.\n\n- **Are the scores (malware, obfuscated, security risk) reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Are any claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports do not claim vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as a benign configuration script.\n\n- **Are the scores consistent with the report?**  \n  Yes. The high confidence (1) and zero malware/obfuscated/security risk scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Assessment:\n- The code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The logic is standard for environment feature detection and test management.\n- No external data or untrusted sinks are involved.\n- The purpose is clear and legitimate: compatibility handling for async tests in pytest.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk, no vulnerabilities, benign purpose)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll evidence points to this being a safe, standard configuration snippet for pytest. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign, well-understood pattern for conditional test execution based on environment capabilities. No changes to scores are necessary.",
