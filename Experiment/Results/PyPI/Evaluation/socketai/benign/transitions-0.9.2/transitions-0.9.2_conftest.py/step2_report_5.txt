  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core logic: attempting to import `asyncio` and `contextvars`, setting a flag (`WITH_ASYNC`), and then using this flag in `pytest_ignore_collect` to skip certain test files if async support isn't available.\n- The code uses standard library imports, straightforward conditional logic, and no external data sources.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks is present across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code correctly checks for module availability via try-except.\n- The `pytest_ignore_collect` function correctly skips async tests if the environment lacks support.\n- The code is simple, clear, and uses standard practices.\n\n**No issues or malicious behavior are present.**\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **None identified.** The code functions as intended, with no logical errors or security flaws.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and their appropriateness:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5; given the benign nature, 0 is appropriate.\n\n**No adjustments needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all reports assign 0, and the code is purely configuration logic for test skipping, there's no justification for higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### Malware considerations:\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.\n- The code only influences test collection, with no external data or network activity.\n\n**Malware score remains 0.**\n\n---\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- The code relies on the presence or absence of modules, which is a standard practice.\n- No assumptions about untrusted input or external data are made.\n- No security vulnerabilities or attack vectors are introduced.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe pytest configuration snippet with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis supply chain review confirms that the code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- No further action required.\n\n**Work completed.**",
