  "purpose": "Configure pytest to only run async tests if asyncio and contextvars modules are available",
  "sources": "Imports of asyncio and contextvars modules, check for module availability, usage of basename from os.path",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Availability check of modules -> Conditional test collection logic -> Exclusion of async tests if modules missing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard library features and straightforward conditional logic",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the presence of asyncio and contextvars modules to determine if async tests should run. It imports only standard libraries and performs a simple conditional check. The async_files list and pytest_ignore_collect function implement logic for skipping async tests when necessary. No suspicious or malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation, is present. The code is simple, clear, and uses standard practices for optional async support.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration script for pytest, enabling or disabling async tests based on environment capabilities. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
