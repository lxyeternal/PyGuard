  "purpose": "Detects environment support for asyncio and contextvars to conditionally skip async tests in pytest.",
  "sources": "Import statements for asyncio and contextvars, and the filename in pytest_ignore_collect.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Import success or failure influences the WITH_ASYNC flag, which then determines test skipping behavior.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward environment detection logic with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import asyncio and contextvars modules within a try-except block to set a support flag. It then uses this flag in pytest_ignore_collect to skip async tests if modules are unavailable. The logic is standard, simple, and relies solely on module availability detection, with no external data or malicious activity involved. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for environment-aware test skipping in pytest. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
