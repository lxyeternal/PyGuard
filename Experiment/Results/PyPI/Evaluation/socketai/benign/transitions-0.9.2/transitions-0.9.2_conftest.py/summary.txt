  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for environment-aware test skipping in pytest. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature."
