  "purpose": "Configure pytest to selectively run async tests based on the availability of asyncio and contextvars modules, ensuring compatibility with Python 3.7+.",
  "sources": "Imports of asyncio and contextvars modules, check for module import errors, and the list of test files.",
  "sinks": "The function pytest_ignore_collect determines whether certain test files should be ignored based on environment conditions.",
  "flows": "Import attempt of asyncio and contextvars → setting WITH_ASYNC → pytest_ignore_collect uses this flag to decide whether to ignore async test files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. The code conditionally disables test collection based on module availability, which is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a descriptive comment and disables a pylint warning for unused imports. It attempts to import asyncio and contextvars, setting a flag based on success. This is used in the pytest_ignore_collect function to prevent collection of async tests if required modules are missing. The logic is straightforward and aims for compatibility, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest configuration for compatibility with different Python versions. It conditionally ignores async tests if necessary modules are unavailable. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
