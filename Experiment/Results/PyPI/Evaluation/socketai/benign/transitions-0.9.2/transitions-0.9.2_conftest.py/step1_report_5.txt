  "purpose": "Configure pytest to conditionally run async tests based on the availability of asyncio and contextvars modules, ensuring compatibility with Python 3.7+.",
  "sources": "Import statements for asyncio and contextvars, check for module availability, and the list of async test files.",
  "sinks": "The function pytest_ignore_collect that can exclude specific test files from collection based on module availability.",
  "flows": "Import check sets the WITH_ASYNC flag; pytest_ignore_collect uses this flag and filename to determine whether to ignore certain test files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; the logic is straightforward and standard for compatibility checks.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically checks for the presence of asyncio and contextvars modules. If these modules are missing, it sets a flag to prevent collection of certain async test files. The approach is simple and adheres to compatibility practices, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest configuration snippet designed for compatibility with different Python versions. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation appears safe and intentional for managing async test execution based on environment capabilities.",
