  "purpose": "Configure pytest to skip async tests if necessary modules (asyncio and contextvars) are unavailable",
  "sources": "Import statements for asyncio and contextvars, and the conditional logic based on their availability",
  "sinks": "The function pytest_ignore_collect which determines whether certain test files are collected or skipped",
  "flows": "Import check → setting WITH_ASYNC → pytest_ignore_collect decision based on module availability and filename",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs straightforward feature detection and conditional test skipping",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules asyncio and contextvars within a try-except block to determine if async features are available. It sets a flag accordingly. The pytest_ignore_collect function uses this flag to skip certain async test files if necessary modules are missing. The logic is simple and based on module presence and filename matching. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation detected. The code is legitimate configuration logic for conditional test collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest configuration that conditionally skips async tests when required modules are not available. No malicious behavior or security issues are present.",
