  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the module as a factory for various state machine classes supporting features like hierarchy, graphs, locking, and asyncio. Notes the conditional import and fallback mock classes for asyncio, and finds no malicious code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The code indeed defines classes, a class map, and handles optional asyncio imports with fallback classes. The `format_references` method is benign, likely for debugging or display purposes.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified; no malicious behavior observed.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1, very low, as the code is primarily structural and does not handle untrusted data or perform risky operations.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate; the code appears safe and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the factory pattern, class mapping, and compatibility handling. No suspicious activity or malicious code detected.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is a standard class factory with conditional imports and fallback classes.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0, appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; the code is a legitimate factory setup.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on class creation, feature flags, and safe handling of optional dependencies. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; the code is a straightforward factory pattern, with no data leaks or malicious behaviors.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0, consistent with the code's functionality.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies the code as safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the class map, optional asyncio support, and fallback classes. Finds no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the fallback classes are simple mocks, and class selection is controlled.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1, minimal, as the code does not process untrusted data.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate; the code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, notes the class map, optional imports, and no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is a standard factory pattern with fallback classes.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; the code is safe and intended for flexible class creation.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious actions—no network activity, no code injection, no data exfiltration, and no backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1), consistent with the code's nature as a factory and class map setup, with no handling of untrusted data or external inputs.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, primarily due to the nature of the code being a factory pattern with optional dependencies)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured factory module for state machine classes supporting various features. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified based on the code's content.",
