  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its structure, and the reasoning provided.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The report correctly identifies that the code defines classes, factory functions, and a mapping for feature combinations.\n- **Malicious code / anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation. The conditional import fallback for asyncio is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. Security risk is 0.1, possibly reflecting the minimal complexity or reliance on external modules, but this is acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion that the code is safe and designed for feature flexibility is accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment is reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Code presence:** Accurately describes class definitions, imports, and class mapping.\n- **Malicious code / anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly states that the code appears legitimate and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the assessment is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Code presence:** Correctly notes class definitions, factory pattern, and handling of optional dependencies.\n- **Malicious code / anomalies:** No evidence of malicious behavior; the code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, security risk is 0, matching the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriately concludes the code is safe and intended for legitimate use.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code; no changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Code presence:** Recognizes class definitions, import handling, and factory pattern.\n- **Malicious code / anomalies:** No suspicious activity; fallback classes are simple mocks.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, security risk is 0.1, which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is a standard factory with no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Code presence:** Describes the code's purpose, class definitions, import handling, and class map.\n- **Malicious code / anomalies:** No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.1, consistent with the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, recognizing the code as a legitimate factory pattern implementation.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, reflecting the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in all reports, which is reasonable given the code's nature as a factory pattern module.\n\n**My own estimate after review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to reliance on external modules and conditional imports, but nothing suspicious.\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a standard, well-structured factory module for creating various state machine classes with support for features like nesting, graphs, locking, and async operations. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.\n\n**Summary:** All reports are consistent with the code's nature. No modifications needed.",
