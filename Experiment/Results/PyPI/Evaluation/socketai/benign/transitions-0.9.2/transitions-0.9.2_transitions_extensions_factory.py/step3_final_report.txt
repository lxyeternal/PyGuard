{
  "purpose": "Provides a factory for creating various state machine classes with support for features like hierarchy, graphs, locking, and async operations.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (functools, itertools, six), local modules (core, nesting, locking, diagrams), conditional asyncio imports with fallback classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Class selection via _CLASS_MAP based on feature flags; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code; fallback classes are simple mocks for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes for state machine variants, uses a factory pattern with a class map for feature combinations, and handles optional asyncio dependencies with fallback classes. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The conditional imports and fallback classes are standard compatibility measures. The format_references method is benign, likely for debugging or display. Overall, the code is a straightforward, well-structured factory module for state machine classes supporting features like nesting, graphs, locking, and async processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign factory module with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. All reports correctly assess its safety, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and low security risk scores (~0.1). The code's purpose and implementation are clear and standard for such a library component.",
