{
  "purpose": "Defines a factory and classes for creating different configurations of state machines with support for threading, graphs, nesting, and asynchronous behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports of modules, especially dynamic import of asyncio extensions, and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code primarily involves class definitions and static methods, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic class selection via a class map; conditional imports with fallback mock classes; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious network or system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, handles optional asyncio extensions with fallback mock classes for older Python versions, defines various machine classes for state management, and uses a class map for dynamic class retrieval based on feature flags. The fallback classes are simple mocks with no behavior, merely placeholders. No untrusted input handling, no data leakage, and no network or file system interactions are present. The overall structure is straightforward, focused on object-oriented configuration and class selection. No obfuscation or malware indicators detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard factory pattern implementation for state machine configurations with fallbacks for compatibility. It contains no malicious or suspicious code. It appears safe and legitimate, designed for flexibility in a state machine library.",
