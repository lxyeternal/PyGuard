{
  "purpose": "Defines a factory for creating various machine classes with different features such as nested states, graph support, locking, and asynchronous capabilities.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes; uses dynamic import fallback; defines class mappings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows, as the code mainly defines classes and static methods without handling user input or network data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation observed. Uses standard Python features and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up class hierarchies, factory methods, and static methods for retrieving class types based on feature flags. It conditionally imports async classes, providing mock classes if imports fail, which is standard practice for compatibility. No data leaks, network operations, or malicious code are present. The code is well-structured with no signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate module for creating and managing state machine classes with various features. No malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious activities are detected.",
