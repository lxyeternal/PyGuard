{
  "purpose": "Provides a lightweight, object-oriented finite state machine implementation in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ for compatibility, and local modules __version__, core (State, Transition, Event, EventData, Machine, MachineError).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly imports modules and defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs; no obfuscated code or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, imports version and core modules, and sets package metadata. There are no user input handling, network communications, or data leaks. The code appears to be a straightforward package initialization with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as the entry point and metadata definition for a Python state machine package. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
