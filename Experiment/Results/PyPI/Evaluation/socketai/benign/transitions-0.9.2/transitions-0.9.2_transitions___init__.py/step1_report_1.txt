{
  "purpose": "Provides a lightweight, object-oriented state machine implementation in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ for compatibility, imports version info and core classes from local modules.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sources or outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily imports modules and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization with metadata and imports. It imports necessary classes and version info, defines some metadata variables, and sets a repository URL. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, data leaks, or malicious logic. The code appears standard and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as an entry point and metadata definition for a state machine library without any suspicious or harmful code present.",
