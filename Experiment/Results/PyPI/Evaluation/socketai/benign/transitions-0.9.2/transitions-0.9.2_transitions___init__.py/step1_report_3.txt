{
  "purpose": "The code provides a lightweight, object-oriented finite state machine implementation in Python, intended for use as a library for managing state transitions in applications.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__ and local modules (.version and .core), which load version info and core classes for state machine functionality.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or network operations present.",
  "flows": "The code imports version and core modules to initialize the library; no data flows from sources to sinks are evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behavior detected. The code appears to be straightforward library setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines metadata variables, and links to a public repository. It does not process user input, handle external data, or perform any system modifications. The import of __future__ ensures compatibility across Python versions but does not introduce risks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The overall structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign library initialization script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply sets up the package metadata and imports core components.",
