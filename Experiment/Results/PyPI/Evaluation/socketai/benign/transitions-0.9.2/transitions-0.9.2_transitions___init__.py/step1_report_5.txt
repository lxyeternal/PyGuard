{
  "purpose": "Provides a lightweight, object-oriented state machine implementation in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports version information and core classes from local modules, possibly user-defined or third-party.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Imports modules for version info and core functionality; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. The code is a typical package initialization script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports essential components for a state machine library, including version info and core classes. It includes metadata such as copyright, license, and URL. There are no dynamic code execution, data handling, or network operations present. The structure is consistent with a standard Python package's __init__.py file. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign package initialization script for a Python state machine library. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
