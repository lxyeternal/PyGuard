{
  "purpose": "Provides a lightweight, object-oriented finite state machine implementation in Python, compatible with Python 2.7+ and 3.0+.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ (absolute_import), and relative imports of version and core modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sources or sinks; no network, file, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code mainly consists of import statements and metadata definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are observed; the code is standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Python package by importing compatibility features (__future__), version information, and core modules for the state machine. It includes metadata such as copyright, license, summary, and URL. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions that could be malicious. The structure and content are typical for an open-source package's entry point or main module initialization, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization script for a Python state machine library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. The package seems safe for use based on this analysis.",
