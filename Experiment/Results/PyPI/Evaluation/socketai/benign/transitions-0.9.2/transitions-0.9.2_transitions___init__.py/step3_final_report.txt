  "purpose": "Initialize the Python package by importing version info, core classes, and setting metadata variables.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, version module, core module, and metadata variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static imports and variable assignments only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static imports and variable definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package initialization with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py file for a Python package, importing compatibility features, version info, core classes, and setting metadata. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network communication, or data processing. All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. The confidence level is high (1), given the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports and scores are appropriate and consistent.",
