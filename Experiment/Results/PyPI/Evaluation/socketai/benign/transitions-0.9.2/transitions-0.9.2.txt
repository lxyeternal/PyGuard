      "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, non-obfuscated state machine framework that relies on dynamic import and method resolution, which could be exploited if callback or module strings are influenced by untrusted sources. No active malicious code or sabotage is evident. The current scores are appropriate, with a moderate risk level reflecting the potential for code injection if inputs are compromised. Proper input validation and whitelisting are recommended to ensure safe operation."

The primary potential security concern is reliance on user-supplied callbacks, which is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. Overall, the supply chain security risk is very low."

The primary security consideration is ensuring callback functions are validated and trusted, as external callbacks could be malicious if supplied from untrusted sources. Overall, the code itself is safe, with a low risk profile, and no embedded malware detected."
