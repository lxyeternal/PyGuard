  "purpose": "Provides extension classes for state machine functionality, including tagging, error handling, timeouts, volatile data, retries, and dynamic feature addition.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters (tags, timeout, retries), event data attributes, callback functions, threading.Timer for timeouts.",
  "sinks": "Callback invocations, attribute modifications, timer creation and cancellation.",
  "flows": "From configuration and event data to callback functions and attribute management, with timers managing timeouts.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected; standard use of threading.Timer and callback invocation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility classes for state extension, employing threading.Timer for timeouts, callback mechanisms, and attribute management. No external input handling or network activity is present. Callbacks are user-defined, which could be malicious if supplied by an attacker, but this is typical in callback-based frameworks. The code is well-structured, clear, and uses standard Python practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or secrets are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured extension module for a state machine framework. It does not contain malicious logic, obfuscation, or sabotage. The primary potential security concern is reliance on user-supplied callbacks, which is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. Overall, the supply chain security risk is very low.",
