  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured extension module for a state machine framework. It does not contain malicious logic, obfuscation, or sabotage. The primary potential security concern is reliance on user-supplied callbacks, which is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. Overall, the supply chain security risk is very low."
