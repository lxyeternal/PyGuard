  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical flaws, scoring appropriateness, and potential security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides standard state extension classes with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no evident vulnerabilities.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected. The high confidence (0.9) is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on callback risks if callbacks are malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher, considering potential malicious callbacks.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly notes that callbacks could be a vector if malicious, but the code itself doesn't contain malicious logic.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score is reasonable, given that callbacks are user-defined and could be malicious if supplied by an attacker. The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** No external input sources or suspicious behavior; standard design.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to reliance on external callbacks.\n- **Comments:** The analysis is thorough; no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1.\n- **Comments:** Well-reasoned; no issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Clear that the code is benign, with no obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns; scoring is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores across all reports are 0.** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated malware.\n- **Obfuscated scores are 0,** consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk scores** are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the code's nature and the reliance on user-defined callbacks.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, well-structured, and standard.\n\n**Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to callback invocation, which is typical in such frameworks and not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's content. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
