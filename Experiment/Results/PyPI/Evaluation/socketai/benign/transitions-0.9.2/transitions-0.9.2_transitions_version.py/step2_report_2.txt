  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe code is a simple assignment:\n```python\n__version__ = '0.9.2'\n```\nThis is a standard pattern for defining package versioning in Python. It involves no external inputs, no dynamic code, no network activity, and no obfuscation. It is a static, straightforward declaration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- The code is a static string assignment.\n- No external data, inputs, or dynamic behaviors are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.\n- The purpose is purely to declare the package version.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, standard, and secure.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple version string assignment.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- All reports assign a confidence level of 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- All scores for malware and security risk are 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Any issues or inconsistencies?**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The reasoning is sound; no false positives or assumptions about vulnerabilities are made.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging Claims and Potential Vulnerabilities:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code does not involve untrusted data, dynamic execution, or external dependencies.\n- There are no claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the evidence, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard, safe version declaration.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a typical, benign pattern with no security concerns.",
