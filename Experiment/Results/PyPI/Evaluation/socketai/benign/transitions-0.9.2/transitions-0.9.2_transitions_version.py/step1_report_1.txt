  "purpose": "Defines the current version of the package for setup and runtime use.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable, which is a hardcoded string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs are present; the code does not contain sinks that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: the version string is assigned to __version__, with no data movement from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code is simple and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to __version__, a common practice for package versioning. No external input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution is involved. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code serves a documentation or configuration purpose only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version declaration with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It is safe and typical for Python packages.",
