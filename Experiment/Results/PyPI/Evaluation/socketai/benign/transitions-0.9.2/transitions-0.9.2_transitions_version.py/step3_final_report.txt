  "purpose": "Declare the current version of the package for setup and runtime use.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of the string '__version__' in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a straightforward version string assignment with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to '__version__', serving as a package version indicator. It involves no inputs, external data, dynamic execution, or network activity. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No logical errors or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
