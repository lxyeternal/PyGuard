  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code carefully.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code is a straightforward assignment of a static version string to `__version__`. All reports agree that the code is simple, static, and contains no dynamic or external inputs.  \n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected in the code.  \n- The code serves a standard purpose in package versioning.\n\n**Conclusion:** The issues described in the reports (which are essentially the same) are *not* present in the code. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a simple static string assignment with no malicious or security-related concerns.  \n- There are no logical flaws or mistakes in the reasoning.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since all reports and the code itself show no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.  \n- The code is a standard version string assignment, common in Python packages, with no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate malware score**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.  \n- There is no malicious behavior, no code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- All claims are based on the code's simplicity and static assignment. No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made; the assessment is accurate.\n\n**Step 7: Check for consistency**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: all zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, with high confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall recommendation:\n\n- The code is a minimal, standard version declaration. It is safe, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, static version string assignment with no malicious or security issues. The reports are correct, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed.",
