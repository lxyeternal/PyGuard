  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string to `__version__`. All reports correctly identify this as a standard practice for package versioning in Python. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, external input, or other suspicious behaviors.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. This is accurate given the simplicity of the code. There are no logical errors or flawed reasoning apparent in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - *Obfuscated score:* All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is clear and straightforward.  \n   - *Malware score:* All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.  \n   - *Security risk score:* All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for any high risk scores:**  \n   Since all reports agree that the code is harmless, there is no justification for a risk score higher than 0.5. The code is standard, minimal, and does not pose any security threat.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior—no code injection, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the actual code content, not assumptions. They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a simple, static version declaration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores appropriately reflect the benign nature of this code snippet.\n\n**Overall recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe, and the scoring is appropriate.",
