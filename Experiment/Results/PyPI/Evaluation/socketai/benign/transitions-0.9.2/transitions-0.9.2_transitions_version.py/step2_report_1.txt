  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code is a simple assignment of a static string `__version__ = '0.9.2'`.\n   - It is used for package versioning, both in setup scripts and at runtime.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or external data fetching.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Malware**:\n   - Given the simplicity, the risk of malicious behavior is negligible.\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or used maliciously.\n\n4. **Scores & Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward nature.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n   - The malware score is 0, correctly indicating no malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential Flaws or Logical Errors in Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; no flaws or logical errors are evident.\n   - They correctly identify this as a standard version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n6. **Any Unreasonable Scores?**:\n   - No, all scores seem appropriate and justified based on the code.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment & Personal Estimate**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n   - **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are reasonable.\n\n**Final recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scores. No changes needed.",
