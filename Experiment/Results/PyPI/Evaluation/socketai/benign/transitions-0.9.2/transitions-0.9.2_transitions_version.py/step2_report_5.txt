  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the original code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Code Flaws:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward assignment of a static version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, input handling, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and serves a clear purpose in version tracking.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - The reasoning that this code is benign and typical for Python packages is correct.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the clarity of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting high certainty based on the simplicity and clarity.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since there's no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior, raising the risk, malware, or obfuscated scores would be unjustified.\n   - The code's purpose is purely informational and standard in package development.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly dismiss any assumptions of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - No assumptions about hidden behaviors or malicious payloads are warranted here.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies or overestimations are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns.**",
