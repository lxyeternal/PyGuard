  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package for use in setup.py and runtime version checks.",
  "sources": "The string assignment '__version__ = '0.9.2'', which provides the package version.",
  "sinks": "Potential use in setup tools and runtime version checks; no direct data leak or untrusted input processing.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version string to __version__; no flow from external input to output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a static version string to the __version__ variable. There are no inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activities, and no suspicious behaviors. This is standard practice for versioning in Python packages and contains no malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
