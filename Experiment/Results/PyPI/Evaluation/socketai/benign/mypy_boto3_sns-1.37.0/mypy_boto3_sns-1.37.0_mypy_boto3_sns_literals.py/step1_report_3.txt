  "purpose": "Define type annotations using Literal for various AWS SNS and resource identifiers to improve type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Literal string definitions assigned to variables, import statements for Literal based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, input, or output operations present.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors observed. The code strictly defines type literals and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static string literals used for type annotations related to AWS SNS and other AWS services. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version. No user input handling, network operations, or file manipulations are present. No malicious patterns or anomalies are detected in the structure or content. The code appears to serve as a type definition module with no executable or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type annotation module for AWS service string literals. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It merely provides type safety for other modules. No security concerns or malware detected.",
