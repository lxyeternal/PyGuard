  "purpose": "Static type annotations for AWS resource names, regions, and related string literals, intended to improve type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Constant string literals defining AWS service names, resource identifiers, regions, paginator names, and related types.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data inputs, external data, or untrusted sources; static definitions only.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow or dynamic execution; purely static type alias definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-structured, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code employs conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines multiple type aliases as string literals for AWS services, regions, and other identifiers. It contains no runtime logic, external data handling, secrets, or obfuscation. All indicators point to static, benign type annotations intended for SDK or codebase type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, safe module defining AWS resource string literals for type annotations. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and poses no security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
