{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS SNS service literals, including regions, resource names, and other enumerations for type safety.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module; no external input sources; type annotations are static.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; code is purely defining constants and types.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static type definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of type annotations conditional on Python version is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines type aliases using Literal for various AWS service constants, with conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version. No external data input, network calls, or dynamic execution. The content appears to be static, well-structured, and purpose-specific for type safety in a larger codebase. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious payloads are present. The inclusion of a copyright notice and documentation link further supports its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, static type definition module for AWS SNS literals. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It serves a purely structural purpose for type safety and clarity within AWS SDK usage.",
