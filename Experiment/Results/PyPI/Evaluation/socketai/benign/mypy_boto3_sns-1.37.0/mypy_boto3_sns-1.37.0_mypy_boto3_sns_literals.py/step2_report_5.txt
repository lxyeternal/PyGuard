  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, as well as the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is purely static, defining string literals and type aliases for AWS resource names, regions, and related identifiers.\n- Conditional import of `Literal` based on Python version is standard practice.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network operations, or file I/O.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks.\n- The purpose is for type safety, documentation, and code clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Define type literals for AWS SNS and related resources.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as static type definitions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on AWS SNS configurations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes the static nature, no dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Define type annotations for AWS SNS and related string literals.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is static, with no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Define type literals for AWS services, regions, and identifiers.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly recognizes the code as benign static type definitions, no external data or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 0.95.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly less than perfect confidence, but justified given the static, benign nature.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Define string literal types for AWS SNS literals.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as safe, static, and for type safety.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is purely static type definitions.\n- **Malware / Obfuscation:** None detected. All reports correctly assign malware score = 0.\n- **Security risk:** None. The code does not process untrusted data or perform any risky operations.\n- **Confidence levels:** Appropriately high, given the static nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\n- **Scores:** All reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Potential adjustments:** None necessary; scores and conclusions are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, well-structured static type definition module for AWS resource literals, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate, and their assessments align with the code's nature.
