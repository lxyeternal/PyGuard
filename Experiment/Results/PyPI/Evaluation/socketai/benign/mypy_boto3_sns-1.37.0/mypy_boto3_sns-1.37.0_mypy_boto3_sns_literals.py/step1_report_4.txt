{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS SNS and related service string values to ensure type safety and consistency in code that interacts with AWS services.",
  "sources": "Literal string definitions assigned to variables like LanguageCodeStringType, ListEndpointsByPlatformApplicationPaginatorName, etc.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data or external inputs are present; the code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as there are only type definitions and import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily consists of static type annotations and large lists of string literals. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code detected. No dynamic execution or external data processing. The license notice and documentation are typical and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines various string literal types to be used elsewhere in the codebase for AWS-related string constants. It includes an extensive list of AWS resource names, regions, and other identifiers. No external inputs, runtime data, or environment variables are used or manipulated. There is no indication of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The purpose is solely to enhance type safety and code clarity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module defining string literal types for AWS services, with no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks. The code is safe and intended for type hinting and validation within a larger codebase.",
