  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS SNS service configurations and related resources to facilitate type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Reading module imports, type alias assignments, and string literal definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data is processed or used insecurely; primarily static type definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines constants and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the code appears to be static, well-structured, and solely for type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static type definitions for various AWS SNS and resource names using Python's Literal types, with conditional import for compatibility. It includes no dynamic code, no input handling, and no network or file operations. No hardcoded secrets or sensitive information are present. All elements are static string literals used for type safety and documentation purposes, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard static type definition module for AWS resource and service names, intended for type safety and documentation. There are no malicious behaviors, security issues, or suspicious anomalies detected.",
