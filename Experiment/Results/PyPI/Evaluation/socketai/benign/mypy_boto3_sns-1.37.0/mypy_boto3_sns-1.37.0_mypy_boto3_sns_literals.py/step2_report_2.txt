  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, cross-examining the code content, logic, and the provided conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS SNS and other AWS services, regions, and resource names.\n- It employs conditional import of `Literal` for compatibility with Python versions >=3.12.\n- No runtime data processing, user input, network calls, or dynamic behavior.\n- No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- The purpose is clearly for type safety, documentation, and code clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type literals for AWS SNS and related resources.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as static, safe, and standard for type annotations.\n- **Risk & Malware:** Both are zero, which aligns with the static nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on AWS SNS configurations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes the absence of dynamic code or malicious patterns.\n- **Risk & Malware:** Zero, consistent with the static definitions.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on type annotations for AWS SNS string values.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is static, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk & Malware:** Zero, matching the static nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literal types for AWS SNS and other services.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately recognizes the code as static, safe, and for type safety.\n- **Risk & Malware:** Zero, consistent with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others, defining AWS literals.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states no malicious behavior or anomalies.\n- **Risk & Malware:** Zero, aligns with the static, safe nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is purely static type definitions.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None. The logic and structure are standard and correct.\n- **Scores:** All malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Consistency:** The reports are consistent with each other and with the code content.\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities:** None are made; all claims are about static, benign code.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert judgment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Additional note:** Given the code's purpose and structure, I would agree with the provided assessments. There is no indication of supply chain attack vectors, malicious payloads, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a benign, static module defining AWS string literal types for type safety and documentation purposes. All reports correctly identify its safety and purpose. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.",
