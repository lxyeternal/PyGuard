  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS SNS service-related strings and other AWS service identifiers to facilitate type safety and code documentation.",
  "sources": "Literal string definitions for various AWS resource names, paginator names, region names, and specific service-related string types.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted or external data; the code only defines constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs; the code uses standard conditional imports for compatibility with Python versions >=3.12.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and literal types for AWS services, regions, and paginator names. It employs conditional imports for 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice. There are no runtime data inputs, external data processing, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code is purely static and intended for type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of type definitions for AWS service string literals. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is safe and aligns with best practices for type annotation in Python.",
