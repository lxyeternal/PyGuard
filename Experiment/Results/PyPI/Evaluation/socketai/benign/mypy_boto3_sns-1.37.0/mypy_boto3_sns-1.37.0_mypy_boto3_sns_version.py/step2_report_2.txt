  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the accuracy of their assessments and scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code snippet is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, external data handling, or dynamic behaviors.\n- The code is minimal, with only a comment and a variable assignment.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, assigning malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code?**  \n   - No. All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple, static version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign and standard.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - Malware score: all 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n   - Obfuscated: all 0, correct given the straightforward code.  \n   - Security risk: all 0, appropriate for static version assignment.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   - None of the reports assign a high risk score; all are 0, which is justified.\n\n5. **Malware score reflection:**  \n   - Correctly assigned as 0, since there's no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n   - No. All reports base their conclusions on observable, static code analysis.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   - Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The code is a standard practice for defining a package version.\n- No external data, no code execution, no obfuscation, no signs of malicious intent.\n- The copyright year is 2025, which is in the future relative to current knowledge, but that alone isn't suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and well-reasoned.** There is no evidence of malicious or suspicious behavior, and the code is a typical version declaration.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current analysis and the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns.",
