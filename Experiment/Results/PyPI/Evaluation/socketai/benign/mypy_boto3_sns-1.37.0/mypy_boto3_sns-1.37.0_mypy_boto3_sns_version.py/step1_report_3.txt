  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a static version string and includes a copyright comment. There are no input sources, data processing, or external communications. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. It is safe and typical for Python packages.",
