  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code snippets are minimal, consisting solely of a version string assignment and a copyright comment.\n- No external inputs, data flows, or I/O operations are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- The version string is hardcoded, which is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No, all reports agree that the code is straightforward and benign. The code does exactly what it claims: defines a version string as the source of truth.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that there are no security concerns, no malicious behavior, and no obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 0.5. Given the benign nature, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. No malicious activity is present or implied.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All assign 0, which is appropriate. No security risks are introduced by such a version declaration.\n\n- **Any anomalies or assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports do not assume malicious intent where none exists.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### My overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the actual code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the analysis is accurate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
