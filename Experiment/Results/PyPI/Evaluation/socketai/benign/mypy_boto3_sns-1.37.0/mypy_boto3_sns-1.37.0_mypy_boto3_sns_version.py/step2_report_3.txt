  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - The code contains only a version string, a copyright comment, and no external data handling or complex logic.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious code are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly state that the code is minimal, benign, and typical for version declaration.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n   - The confidence score of 1 is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - All scores are zero, which is reasonable.\n   - There is no indication of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n   - No need to adjust scores upward.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code is a standard version string assignment with no malicious intent.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate and consistent across reports.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They focus on the actual code content, which is benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Personal Estimate (Post-Review):\n\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code poses no security threat.",
