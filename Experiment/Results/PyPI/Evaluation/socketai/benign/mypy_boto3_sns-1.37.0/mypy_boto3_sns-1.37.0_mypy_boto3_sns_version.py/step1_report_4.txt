  "purpose": "Define and expose the version number of the package/module.",

  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version assignment with no hidden or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string '1.37.0' to __version__, which is a common practice in Python modules. There is no input, no data processing, and no code execution or data leakage. The only content is a comment indicating source of truth and copyright info, and a straightforward version assignment. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version identifier for the package. It contains no malware, no suspicious data flows, and no security risks.",
