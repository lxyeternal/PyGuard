  "purpose": "Define the package version as a static string for source of truth.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data flows, or I/O; static assignment of __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment with no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version string assignment with a copyright comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of a version string assignment and a comment. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity. The confidence score is high (1), given the static and standard nature of the code. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No further action is necessary.",
