  "purpose": "Type annotations and resource class definitions for AWS SNS SDK, facilitating type-safe interactions without processing external data.",
  "sources": "Method parameters (e.g., **kwargs) passed directly into SDK calls, originating from user inputs or external data, but not explicitly read within the code.",
  "sinks": "AWS SDK method calls that utilize **kwargs to configure resources or actions, potentially influenced by external inputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method arguments (kwargs) into AWS API calls, with no internal validation or sanitization.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; standard SDK pattern with dynamic kwargs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured set of class definitions and method signatures for AWS SNS resources, designed for type safety. No dynamic code execution, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The use of **kwargs is typical for SDK wrappers; while it could be misused if external inputs are malicious, this is a known pattern and not inherently malicious. No signs of backdoors, data leaks, or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated SDK stub for AWS SNS resources, with no malicious intent or behavior. The potential security concern is the passing of untrusted data via **kwargs, which is standard for SDK interfaces but should be used cautiously. Overall, the supply chain security posture is safe.",
