  "purpose": "Type annotations and resource class definitions for AWS SNS service using boto3, enabling type-safe interaction with SNS resources.",
  "sources": "Imports from boto3.resources and custom type definitions; resource methods creating and managing SNS entities; dynamic attribute access and method calls.",
  "sinks": "Method calls that accept untrusted input via **kwargs, which are unpacked into API parameters; resource creation functions; resource attribute assignments.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input via kwargs flows into SNS API calls such as create_platform_endpoint, set_attributes, subscribe, publish, etc., via **kwargs unpacking; resource method invocations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of **kwargs with Unpack for passing parameters; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; method signatures are consistent with official SDK usage; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; resource class definitions appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines type annotations, resource collection classes, and resource classes for the SNS boto3 service, with methods corresponding to SNS API operations. It relies on dynamic parameter passing via **kwargs with explicit type definitions, consistent with SDK usage. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are present. The resource classes facilitate resource management and do not contain executable logic beyond calling AWS APIs. No backdoors, hidden network calls, or suspicious behavior are detected. Use of dynamic kwargs could potentially lead to misuse if untrusted data is passed, but that is expected behavior for SDK wrappers, not malware. Overall, the code appears to be a well-structured, type-safe SDK wrapper without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type annotations and resource class definitions for AWS SNS SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It facilitates safe resource management with explicit type definitions and standard SDK patterns. There is no evidence of malware or security risks in the provided code.",
