{
  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the package, including version and documentation links.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout.write for output.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data; no untrusted input handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (from sys.argv) leading to print_version or print_info output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, then conditionally prints package info or version to stdout. The data printed is static, hardcoded documentation URLs and version info. No user input is used directly in outputs, nor are there external data fetches or network connections. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be a straightforward CLI utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign CLI script that outputs static package information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or security risks.",
