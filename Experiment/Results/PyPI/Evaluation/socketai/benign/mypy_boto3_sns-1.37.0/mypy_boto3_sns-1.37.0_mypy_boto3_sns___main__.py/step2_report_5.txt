  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI script that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - No dynamic code, user input processing beyond argument check, or external data fetching.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors.\n   - The code is benign and intended solely for informational purposes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as simple, static, and benign.\n   - They consistently note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No inaccuracies or logical flaws are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1.0 (or 1)\n   - These scores are reasonable given the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code shows no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and no vulnerabilities.\n   - All reports agree on zero malware and security risk.\n   - Therefore, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n   - Malware score should be 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and do not assume malicious intent where none exists.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign based on static, straightforward logic.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n   - Confidence scores are high, reflecting the clear benign nature.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Final Justification:**\nThe code is a simple, static CLI utility that outputs package info or version. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly reflect this assessment.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence presented.",
