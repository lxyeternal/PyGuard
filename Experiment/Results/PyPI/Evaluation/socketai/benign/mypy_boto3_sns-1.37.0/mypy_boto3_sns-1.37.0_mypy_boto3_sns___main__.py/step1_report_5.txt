  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about a Python package, including its version and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments from sys.argv; writing package info to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Writing output to stdout.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version() which writes to stdout; otherwise, print_info() writes package details to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs detected. The code strictly outputs package info and version details.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys for standard input/output operations, defines functions to print package info and version, and a main function that conditionally executes based on command-line arguments. No external inputs are processed beyond command-line args, and outputs are limited to informational text. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The code appears to be a simple CLI utility intended for informational purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility that outputs package metadata and version info. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
