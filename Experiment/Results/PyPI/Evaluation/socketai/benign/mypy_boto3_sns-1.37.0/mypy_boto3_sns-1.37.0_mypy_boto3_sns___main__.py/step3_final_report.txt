  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout using sys.stdout.write",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) -> conditional branch -> stdout.write output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static, straightforward code with no dynamic input, external calls, or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a static CLI script that checks for '--version' argument and prints either version or package info. It contains no external network activity, no dynamic data processing, no secrets, and no obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The code's simplicity and static nature justify assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as zero. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0), given the clear and straightforward code structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility that provides package info and version details. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
