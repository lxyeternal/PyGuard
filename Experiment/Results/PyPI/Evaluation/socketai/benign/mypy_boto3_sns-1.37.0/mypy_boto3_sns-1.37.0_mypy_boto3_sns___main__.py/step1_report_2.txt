  "purpose": "CLI entry point for a package providing information about boto3 SNS type annotations and version.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments; sys.stdout for output.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (e.g., '--version') flows to control logic, then to output functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys to handle command-line arguments and output. It defines two functions: print_info() and print_version(), both outputting static, informational text about the package. The main() function checks for the '--version' argument and calls the appropriate function, or defaults to print_info(). The script is a straightforward CLI utility providing static info. No user input is processed beyond argument checking, and no data is sent over network or stored. The code contains no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated logic, no external resource fetching, or hidden behaviors. Overall, the code is simple, static, and contains no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script that outputs static package information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply serves as an informational entry point with no hidden or suspicious activities.",
