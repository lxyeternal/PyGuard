  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info or version.\n   - It reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) to determine whether to print version or info.\n   - It outputs data via `sys.stdout.write`.\n   - There are no dynamic inputs, external network calls, or data manipulation.\n   - No obfuscation, no secrets, no malicious code, no backdoors.\n\n2. **Review of the Reports**:\n   - All five reports agree that the code is benign, static, and purely informational.\n   - They consistently mention the absence of suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware.\n   - The analysis confirms that the code performs simple, safe output based on command-line arguments.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, no obfuscation.\n   - **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, no malicious activity or payloads.\n   - **Security Risk (0)**: Correct, no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n4. **Potential for Higher Scores?**\n   - Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, there is no basis for increasing the malware or security risk scores.\n   - The reports' assessments are consistent and justified.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - The code does not process untrusted input beyond argument checking, which is safe.\n   - No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a benign CLI utility with no security issues.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports (all zeros for malware, obfuscated, and risk) are appropriate.\n   - The confidence level of 1.0 in all reports is justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Security Risk Score**: 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the code's nature.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a simple, static CLI script providing package info. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors are present. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
