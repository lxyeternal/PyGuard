  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for SNS service client in boto3, providing paginated access to various SNS API endpoints with type safety.",
  "sources": "The code reads only static type definitions, module imports, and method parameters; no external input or user data handling occurs.",
  "sinks": "The only sinks are the paginate methods returning PageIterator objects; these are standard for boto3 paginators and do not process untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data; the code strictly defines paginator classes with no data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. The code strictly defines type-safe classes and methods with no malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type annotations and classes for paginators in boto3 SNS client, including type definitions, conditional imports for compatibility, and class inheritance for paginator behavior. No external input handling, network operations, or data processing occurs. All operations are static class and method definitions, following boto3 documentation. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or backdoors, is present. The code is well-structured and adheres to typical boto3 stub conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for type safety and API interface definition, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard pattern for boto3 type stubs, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
