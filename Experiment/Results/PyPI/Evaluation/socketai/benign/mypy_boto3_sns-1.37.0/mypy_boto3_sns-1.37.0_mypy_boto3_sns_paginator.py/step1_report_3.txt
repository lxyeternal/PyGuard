  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for SNS service client in boto3, enabling type-checked pagination support.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; class method parameters; type annotations for pagination.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external effects; typical paginator methods returning PageIterator objects with response types.",
  "flows": "Paginator classes' paginate methods accept arbitrary kwargs with specific types, returning PageIterator objects with response data; no external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of sys.version_info check for importing Unpack is standard for compatibility; no obfuscation evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for the SNS service, adding type annotations for method parameters and return types. Conditional import for Unpack ensures compatibility across Python versions. The classes inherit from a base Paginator class, with paginate methods properly typed using Unpack and specific response types. No signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. All code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of enabling type-safe pagination support. No external network calls, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are identified. The code structure is typical for generated type stubs with standard patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, type-annotated paginator class implementation for boto3 SNS client with no malicious behavior detected. It primarily facilitates static type checking and code completion, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
