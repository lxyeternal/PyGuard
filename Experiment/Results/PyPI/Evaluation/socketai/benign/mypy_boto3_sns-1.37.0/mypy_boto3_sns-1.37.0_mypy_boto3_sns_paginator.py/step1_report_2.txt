  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for boto3 SNS service client, providing structured access to paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions. Data reads from sys.version_info, imported modules, and class method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters in 'paginate' functions, which receive keyword arguments unpacked from specific type definitions; no untrusted data sources or external network calls observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method call parameters (kwargs) through the 'paginate' methods, which are type-annotated for structured data, to return PageIterator objects. No external data injection points or sinks connecting to network or file operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious logic. The code consists mainly of class definitions, type annotations, and method signatures. Use of 'Unpack' for type annotations is standard in Python 3.12+ and typing_extensions fallback. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple paginator classes inheriting from a base Paginator class, with 'paginate' methods that accept keyword arguments with specific type annotations. These classes are designed to interface with the boto3 SNS client, facilitating paginated responses. The code includes conditional imports based on Python version, type checking blocks, and detailed docstrings referencing documentation URLs. There are no external calls, network operations, or dynamic code execution. All elements serve to provide type hints and class structures, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for type annotations and class structures to support boto3 SNS paginators. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK stub with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
