  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard set of paginator class definitions for AWS SNS, focusing on type annotations and class structure. It notes the use of '**kwargs' in 'paginate' methods, which could theoretically accept untrusted input, but this is typical for API wrappers.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Scores malware=0 and obfuscated=0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose and lack of malicious elements, a low risk score (0.1) is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The reasoning is sound and the scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's role in providing type safety and structure. It notes the conditional import for Python version compatibility and the absence of external effects.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Scores malware=0, obfuscated=0, which is justified.\n- **Risk Score:** Also appropriately low at 0.0 or 0.1.\n- **Verdict:** No concerns. The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Focuses on the code's role in enabling static type checking, with no external data handling or dynamic behaviors. Highlights the standard pattern of boto3 stub classes.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Risk Score:** Zero or near-zero is justified.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; reasoning and scoring are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Recognizes the code as purely defining type annotations and classes for paginator support, with no external or malicious effects.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, as expected.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states that the code is for type-safe iteration over SNS paginated responses, with no malicious behaviors. Notes the use of '**kwargs' and conditional imports.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Risk Score:** Appropriately low.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a set of boto3 stub classes for SNS paginators, mainly for type safety and IDE support.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Use of '**kwargs':** Standard for API wrappers; no indication of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are 0, obfuscated scores are 0, and risk scores are very low (~0.1), consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0.1 (due to potential misuse of '**kwargs', but this is standard and not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured type stub for boto3 SNS paginators with no malicious or security concerns. The reports' reasoning and scoring are consistent and appropriate.",
