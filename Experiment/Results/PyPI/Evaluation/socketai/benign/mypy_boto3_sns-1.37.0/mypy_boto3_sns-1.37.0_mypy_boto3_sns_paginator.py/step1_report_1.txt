  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for the AWS SNS service client, providing structured and typed access to paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "Code reads import statements, system version checks, and class method parameters (particularly in 'paginate' methods).",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods could potentially handle untrusted input via '**kwargs', which are unpacked into API request parameters.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input in '**kwargs' flows into the 'paginate' methods, which invoke the underlying Paginator's 'paginate' method, leading to API calls with user-supplied parameters.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Usage of type annotations and imports appears standard. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for AWS SNS using boto3 stubs with detailed type annotations. It conditionally imports 'Unpack' for Python 3.12+ compatibility. Each paginator class inherits from a base Paginator, and the 'paginate' method accepts '**kwargs' unpacked into the request parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system harm. The primary concern is that 'kwargs' could contain untrusted data, but this is typical for such API wrappers. No suspicious code patterns or malicious payloads are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and class definitions for paginating SNS API responses. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
