  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for AWS SNS service client, enabling type-safe iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class methods that invoke paginators.",
  "sinks": "Paginator.paginate methods which accept **kwargs and return PageIterator; no direct untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "The paginate() methods receive untrusted input via **kwargs and produce paginated responses; no data leakage or command execution points evident.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution. It adheres to typical pattern for boto3 stubs with conditional import based on Python version. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple paginator classes for AWS SNS, with type annotations for safe usage. The classes extend generic Paginator with specific response types, and their paginate() methods accept dynamic parameters. The conditional import of Unpack based on Python version is standard. No suspicious code behaviors such as network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious logic are present. The code is straightforward, mainly for type checking and safe API iteration.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, standard set of type-safe AWS SNS paginator class definitions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a type stub library for boto3, ensuring safe and correct usage of paginators.",
