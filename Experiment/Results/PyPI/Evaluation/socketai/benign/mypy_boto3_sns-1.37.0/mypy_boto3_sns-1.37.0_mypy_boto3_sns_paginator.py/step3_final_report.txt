  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for AWS SNS SDK stubs, facilitating static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Class method signatures accepting '**kwargs' for pagination parameters, imported type definitions, conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or sinks; 'kwargs' are used solely for API parameter passing within the SDK stub context.",
  "flows": "Unpack '**kwargs' in 'paginate' methods into API calls; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for paginators with type annotations, conditional imports for compatibility, and no dynamic or external data handling. The use of '**kwargs' is standard for SDK wrappers and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or malicious logic is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the code's static, structural nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured SDK stub code for boto3 SNS paginators with no malicious or security issues. The low risk score reflects the potential for misuse of '**kwargs' but does not imply actual malicious activity.",
