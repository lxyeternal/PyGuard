  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, straightforward setup.py script.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code reads a local README.md file for the long description, which is safe.\n- Package metadata, dependencies, URLs, and classifiers are statically defined.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- The confidence levels are high (1.0), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the script.\n- The reasoning is sound: no external inputs, no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- None detected. All reports are aligned with the code's actual content.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or obfuscated.\n- The dependency declaration `typing-extensions; python_version<\"3.12\"` is standard and safe.\n\n**Risk score justification:**\n- Since all evidence points to a benign setup script, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n- Malware score is correctly 0.\n- Obfuscated code score is correctly 0.\n- Security risk is correctly 0.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a typical, benign setup.py script for packaging a Python library.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The scores and conclusions in all reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the script is standard, safe, and free of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard package setup script with no security concerns. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
