{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package 'mypy-boto3-sns', used to configure package metadata, dependencies, and packaging details for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, static metadata declarations, and dependencies specified in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input; the script primarily defines package configuration data.",
  "flows": "No dynamic or untrusted data flow present; the script reads static files and declares package info, with dependencies declared statically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed. The code is straightforward package setup with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a README.md file for a long description, and calls setup() with static package metadata and configuration parameters. The dependencies are explicitly declared, and no code execution or untrusted input handling occurs. The code strictly adheres to standard package setup patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies. It performs normal package configuration tasks with static data and safe file reading operations.",
