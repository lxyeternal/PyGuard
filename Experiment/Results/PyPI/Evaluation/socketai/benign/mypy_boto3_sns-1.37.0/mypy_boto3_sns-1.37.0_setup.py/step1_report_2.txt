{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-sns package, defining metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long_description; static package metadata (name, version, author, etc.); no external data inputs or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used; the script only reads local files and defines package configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; static data used for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward setup script with no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a local README.md file, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. All operations are standard for Python package setup. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, hidden code, or credential handling. No external inputs or dynamic code execution are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious actions or handle sensitive data improperly.",
