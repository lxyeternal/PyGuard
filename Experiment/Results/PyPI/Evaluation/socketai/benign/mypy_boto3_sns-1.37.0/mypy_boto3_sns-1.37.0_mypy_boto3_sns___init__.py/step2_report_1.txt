  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code sets up an SNS client interface, importing various classes and a conditional import for SNSServiceResource.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing or external input handling is present.\n- **Anomalies:** The fallback to `object` for SNSServiceResource is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no security risks. The confidence score is 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly describes the module as an interface with no data processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** The fallback import pattern is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity, obfuscated code, or malicious intent. Confidence is 0.9, which is reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, which seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the import setup and conditional import.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** The fallback to `object` is typical, though it could theoretically be exploited if local modules are compromised—but this is highly unlikely and standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security issues detected. The confidence score is 0.9, which is acceptable.\n\n**Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, consistent with the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar description, focusing on the import structure.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** The fallback pattern is standard; no suspicious logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity. Confidence is 1, fitting the straightforward nature.\n\n**Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the module's role.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or external data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** The fallback import is standard, with no malicious implications.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. Confidence is 1.\n\n**Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is a simple module setup for an SDK interface, with no processing of untrusted data, no network activity, and no embedded secrets.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both scores are 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0.1 in some reports due to the fallback import pattern, but this is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- The code is entirely benign, serving as a module interface with standard import patterns.\n- The fallback to `object` is a common pattern for optional dependencies and does not introduce malicious behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Proposed Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low; just the fallback import pattern, which is standard and not risky)\n\n**Summary:** The current scores are accurate and justified. The code is safe, well-structured, and typical for an SDK interface module.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is secure and free of malicious intent.",
