  "purpose": "Provides an interface for AWS SNS service, importing client classes, paginators, and an optional service resource.",
  "sources": "Import statements for SDK classes, paginators, and conditional import for SNSServiceResource.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up imports and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "The fallback import pattern for SNSServiceResource is standard; no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface module with no data processing, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The conditional import for SNSServiceResource is a common pattern for optional dependencies. No obfuscated code, secrets, or malicious logic are present. The scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are justified given the simplicity and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and serves as a typical SDK interface module. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The current scores are accurate and appropriate.",
