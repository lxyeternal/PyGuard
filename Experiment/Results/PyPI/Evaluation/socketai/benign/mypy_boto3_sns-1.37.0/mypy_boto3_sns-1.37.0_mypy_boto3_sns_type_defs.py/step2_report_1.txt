  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the conclusions are justified, and whether any adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a static module providing type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS SNS interactions.\n- No executable logic, data handling, or network operations are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.\n- The code is well-structured, uses conditional imports for compatibility, and adheres to standard typing practices.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as type annotations for SNS.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The analysis correctly states the code is static, benign, and serves as type definitions.\n- **Confidence & Scores:** High confidence, malware score 0, security risk 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes type annotations and constants.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of data flow or untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly concludes the code is static, safe, and solely for type checking.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as type annotations for static analysis.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime or data processing logic.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is benign, for static type hints only.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as data type definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is purely static, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as type definitions for SDK interactions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data flow or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No issues.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly concludes the code is safe, static, and for documentation/type safety.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as there's no security risk.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, static type definition module for AWS SNS SDK, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and appropriately assess the code as benign, purely static, and intended for type safety and documentation. No modifications are necessary.",
