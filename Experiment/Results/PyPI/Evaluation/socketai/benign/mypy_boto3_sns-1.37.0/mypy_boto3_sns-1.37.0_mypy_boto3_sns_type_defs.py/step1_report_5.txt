  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS SNS service API interactions, including input/output structures and data types.",
  "sources": "Constants, imported modules, and class definitions primarily for data type annotations; no external or untrusted data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data flows into system commands, network calls, or file writes are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve structured data assignments within type definitions; no runtime data flow or untrusted input processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of standard type annotations and structured data is typical for SDK type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type annotations, data structures, and documentation for the SNS SDK. It imports standard modules, defines types, and annotates expected data formats without any dynamic or executable code. There are no input handling, network calls, or data processing logic that could be exploited or used maliciously. The code appears to be a safe, static schema for data validation and type checking, consistent with SDK type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static collection of type definitions for AWS SNS SDK and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured, and intended for type safety and documentation.",
