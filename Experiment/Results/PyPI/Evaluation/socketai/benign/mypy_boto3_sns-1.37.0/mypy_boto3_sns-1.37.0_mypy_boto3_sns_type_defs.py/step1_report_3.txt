{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and data structures for interacting with the AWS SNS service, primarily for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, imported modules, and type definitions; no external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data flows that handle untrusted input or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows indicative of malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code strictly defines type annotations and data structures with no logic or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of type definitions, imports, and docstrings intended for static analysis and documentation. It imports standard libraries and AWS SDK types, defining various TypedDicts for SNS API parameters and responses. There are no executable statements, data handling, or network operations. The code appears well-structured for type safety without any signs of obfuscated or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely declarative, serving as type annotations for AWS SNS service interactions. It contains no executable logic, data leaks, or malicious behavior. It is a benign, well-structured module for type hints and documentation purposes.",
