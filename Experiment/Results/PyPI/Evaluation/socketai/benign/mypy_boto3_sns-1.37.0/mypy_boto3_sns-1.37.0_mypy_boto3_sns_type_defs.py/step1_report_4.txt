{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations for AWS SNS service data structures, facilitating static type checking in Python projects that interact with SNS.",
  "sources": "Type definitions, imports, and constants that provide data schemas and type annotations; no direct data input reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions; the code only declares data types and does not execute any logic that processes untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow or data processing logic; primarily static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. Use of conditional imports based on sys.version_info is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of type annotations and data structure definitions for SNS interactions, utilizing TypedDict and Union for type safety. It employs standard Python typing practices, conditional imports for compatibility, and no executable logic. No sources or sinks for untrusted data are present, and there are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. The code appears to be part of a type hints library for AWS SDKs, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type definitions for AWS SNS service, with no malicious behavior, no data processing, and no security risks. It is intended for static type checking and documentation purposes only.",
