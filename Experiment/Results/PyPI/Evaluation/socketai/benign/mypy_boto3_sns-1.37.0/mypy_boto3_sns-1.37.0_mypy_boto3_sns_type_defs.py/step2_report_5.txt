  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for SNS in boto3, imports standard modules, no dynamic code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing, no external data handling, no network calls.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; no secrets or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely static type definitions, no executable logic, no malicious activity.\n- **Risk & Malware:** Both are zero; code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static type annotations for AWS SNS.\n- No runtime logic, no external interactions, no signs of obfuscation.\n- Clear conclusion: purely for static type checking, safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the code being solely data structures and type annotations.\n- No data handling, no network or external system interaction.\n- No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- Safe and intended for documentation and static analysis.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: type definitions, data schemas, no executable code.\n- No untrusted data processing or external calls.\n- No signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous reports: static type annotations, data models for SNS.\n- No runtime logic, data flows, or external interactions.\n- No anomalies or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis Summary:\n- **Code Content:** Entirely composed of type annotations, TypedDicts, constants, and import statements.\n- **Behavior & Data Flow:** No executable logic, data processing, or external system interaction.\n- **Potential for Malicious Activity:** None detected; no secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Security Risks:** None; static data structures only.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — purely static type definitions, no security implications.\n\n### Justification:\nThe code is a standard static type annotation module for AWS SNS SDKs, designed to improve type safety and documentation. It does not process data at runtime, does not interact with external systems, and contains no malicious or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and justified.**  \nNo changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nBased on all reports and analysis, I concur with the provided evaluations. The code is benign, static, and safe.",
