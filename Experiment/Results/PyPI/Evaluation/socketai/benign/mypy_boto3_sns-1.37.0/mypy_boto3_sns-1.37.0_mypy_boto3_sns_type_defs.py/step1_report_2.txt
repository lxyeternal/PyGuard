  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS SNS service type definitions for static type checking.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, imported modules, and type annotations throughout the code.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data directly; primarily type definitions and constants.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; this code is strictly type annotations and data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns. No code execution, network operations, or data leaks present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly contains type definitions, class declarations, and import statements for static type checking. No runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions are present. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The module provides structured data types for SNS interactions, adhering to type annotations. It uses conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions and defines various TypedDicts for request and response structures. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for type annotations and data structure definitions related to AWS SNS. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or sabotage. The code appears safe and intended solely for static type checking purposes.",
