{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for SNS service type definitions used in boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as sys, datetime, typing, botocore.response, and local literals; defines TypedDicts, Union types, and constants.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks, but data structures potentially used in network communication or API calls; no direct untrusted data handling, input/output, or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No executable logic or data flow; primarily static type definitions and data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. The code appears to be a straightforward type definition module, with conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly provides type annotations and data models for SNS API interactions using TypedDict and other typing constructs. It conditionally imports modules for compatibility across Python versions. There is no executable logic, dynamic code execution, or data handling that could be malicious. The code does not interact with external systems, files, or network sources, nor does it contain any obfuscated or suspicious code constructs. The copyright statement is benign and typical for open-source projects. Overall, the code appears to be standard, purely static, and for type hinting purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of type annotations and data structure definitions for SNS services. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It serves as a static helper module for type safety and documentation.",
