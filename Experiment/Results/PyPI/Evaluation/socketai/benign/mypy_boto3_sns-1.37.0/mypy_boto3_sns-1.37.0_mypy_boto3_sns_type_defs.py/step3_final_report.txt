  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS SNS SDK interactions, facilitating static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static definitions, TypedDicts, constants, and conditional imports; no runtime data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, external calls, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; purely static type annotations and data schemas.",
  "anomalies": "None; no suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions, TypedDicts, constants, and compatibility imports. It does not include executable logic, data handling, or network operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is to serve as type hints and documentation for AWS SNS interactions, which inherently poses no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module providing type annotations for AWS SNS SDK, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-related concerns. All evidence and analysis support a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, consistent with the original assessments.",
