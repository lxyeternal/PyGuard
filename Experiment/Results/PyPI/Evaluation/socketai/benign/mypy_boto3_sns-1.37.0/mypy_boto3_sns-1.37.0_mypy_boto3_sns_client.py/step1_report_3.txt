  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for interacting with AWS SNS service using boto3-stubs for type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard and third-party libraries; type definitions; class and method definitions including client operations and pagination.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to AWS SNS API endpoints; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks observed within this code.",
  "flows": "Method signatures define source (input parameters) leading to AWS API calls (sinks); no data flow analysis beyond method signatures as actual implementations are not present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual logic detected. The code strictly defines types and method signatures for a client library. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and a class structure for AWS SNS client interactions. It includes imports, class definitions, method signatures, and overloads for paginators. There is no executable or malicious logic; it is a standard type stub implementation for AWS SDK. The code appears to be a well-structured type hinting module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The only potential concern could be if malicious code was inserted into the method implementations, but these are placeholders and signatures only, consistent with a stub or interface file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type stub/interface for AWS SNS client with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It strictly defines types and method signatures for safe interaction with AWS SNS, with no suspicious or harmful code detected.",
