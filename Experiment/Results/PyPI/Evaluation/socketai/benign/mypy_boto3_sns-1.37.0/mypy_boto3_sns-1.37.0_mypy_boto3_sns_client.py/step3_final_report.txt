{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and class definitions for the AWS SNS client, including exception classes, method signatures, and paginator overloads, serving as a static type stub for boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore and typing modules, class definitions, method signatures with type annotations, overloads for paginators, and exception class declarations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; the code is purely declarative with no runtime logic or external data processing.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; the code defines interfaces and type annotations only.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual element is the copyright year '2025', which appears to be a placeholder or future date but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured type stub for the boto3 SNS client, including exception classes, method signatures, and paginator overloads. No executable logic, network operations, or data leaks are present. The code serves solely for static type checking and IDE support. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The minimal security risk score (around 0.1) reflects the nature of SDK interface code, not an actual vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, static type stub for the AWS SNS boto3 client, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a standard, safe interface definition.",
