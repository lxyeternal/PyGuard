  "purpose": "Define and parse the package version information as static metadata.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ and splitting it into __version_info__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static data only",
  "flows": "Assignment of __version__ -> split and convert to tuple -> stored in __version_info__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no dynamic or obfuscated elements",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string and converts it into a tuple of integers. It involves no external data, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscation. The operations are simple and serve as metadata. No suspicious patterns, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is safe, static, and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as version metadata. All reports correctly identify its safe and static nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and security risk is 0, which are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
