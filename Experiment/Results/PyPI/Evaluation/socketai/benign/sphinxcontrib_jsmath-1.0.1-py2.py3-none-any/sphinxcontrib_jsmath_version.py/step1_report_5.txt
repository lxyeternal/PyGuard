  "purpose": "Define version information for the sphinxcontrib.jsmath package.",
  "sources": "Read the __version__ string, split and convert it into a tuple of integers.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause harm or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining __version__, splitting it, and converting to a tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward version assignment and parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports no external data, defines a static version string, and converts it into a tuple of integers for version info. No inputs, no outputs beyond simple variable assignments, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated elements. It is purely definitional and metadata-focused.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely defining version metadata with no malicious intent or security risks.",
