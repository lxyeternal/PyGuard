  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports no modules, defines a static version string, and creates a tuple of integers from it. It serves as version metadata. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors that could be exploited or indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely declarative, defining version information with no malicious or security-risk behavior.",
