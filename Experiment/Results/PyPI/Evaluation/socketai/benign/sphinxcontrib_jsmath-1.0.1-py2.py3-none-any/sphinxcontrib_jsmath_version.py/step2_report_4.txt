  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The original code is a straightforward version declaration: assigning a static string to `__version__` and parsing it into a tuple `__version_info__`.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, static, and serves purely as metadata.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The code does not process untrusted input, perform external communication, or execute dynamic code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Code correctness:**\n   - The code is correct: it assigns a version string and splits it into integers safely.\n   - The parsing method (`tuple(map(int, __version__.split('.')))` ) is standard and safe given the static version string.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - No errors or flaws are evident in the logic or reasoning.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as simple and benign.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - Security risk score is 0, which is correct.\n   - Confidence is 1, reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n\n4. **Risk justification:**\n   - Since the code is static, simple, and does not process untrusted data, the risk scores are justified at 0.\n   - No reason to increase the scores based on the evidence.\n\n5. **Malware and obfuscation:**\n   - No malware or obfuscation is present; the scores reflect this.\n\n6. **Potential vulnerabilities:**\n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is clearly safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and appropriate.\n- The analysis correctly identifies the code as benign and metadata-only.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\nThe code is safe, and the reports are accurate.",
