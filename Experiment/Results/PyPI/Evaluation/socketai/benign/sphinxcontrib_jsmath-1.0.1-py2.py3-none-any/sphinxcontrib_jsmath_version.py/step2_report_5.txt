  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code simply assigns a version string (`__version__ = '1.0.1'`) and creates a tuple of integers (`__version_info__`) by splitting and mapping the string.\n   - There are no external inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No code execution, obfuscation, or external data handling is present.\n   - The operations are straightforward and serve as metadata for version tracking.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Vulnerabilities:**\n   - The code is static and declarative.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No external modules or dynamic code execution.\n   - No potential for code injection, data leaks, or malicious activity.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature of this code.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is straightforward, static, and serves only as version metadata.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), which aligns with the benign assessment.\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The security risk score is also 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are reasonable and consistent.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the evidence.\n\n5. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n   - The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** This is a straightforward, static version information module with no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports correctly identify this.",
