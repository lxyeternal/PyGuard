  "purpose": "Defines version information for the sphinxcontrib.jsmath package.",
  "sources": "Reads the __version__ string variable, splits it into components, and converts to integers.",

  "flows": "The version string is split and converted into a tuple of integers, serving as internal metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard version info code.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string, then parses it into a tuple of integers. It imports no external data, executes straightforward string splitting and casting, and contains no dynamic code or external communication. It is a minimal version info module with no suspicious patterns or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version information module with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
