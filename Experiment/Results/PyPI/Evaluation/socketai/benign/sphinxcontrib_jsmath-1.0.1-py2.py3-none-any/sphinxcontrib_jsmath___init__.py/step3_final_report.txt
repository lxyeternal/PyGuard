  "purpose": "A Sphinx extension to render math equations in HTML using the JSMath JavaScript library, conditionally loading external JS based on configuration.",
  "sources": "Configuration value 'jsmath_path' and environment data for equation presence.",
  "sinks": "Loading external JavaScript file specified by 'jsmath_path'.",
  "flows": "Checks for equations; if present and configured, loads external JS; renders math nodes into HTML.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard extension behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Sphinx extension that sets up math rendering with JSMath. It loads an external script based on user configuration, which could be malicious if the configuration is compromised. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The external script inclusion is the primary security concern, but this is a common pattern and depends on trusted configuration. The code itself is benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The extension is safe internally, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main risk stems from external script loading via user-controlled configuration, which is typical but warrants trust in the configuration source. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is approximately 0.2, reflecting moderate concern due to external resource inclusion.",
