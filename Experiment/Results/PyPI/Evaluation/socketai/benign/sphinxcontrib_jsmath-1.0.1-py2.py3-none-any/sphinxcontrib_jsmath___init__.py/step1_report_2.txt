{
  "purpose": "The code sets up the 'jsmath' extension for Sphinx documentation to render mathematical equations using JavaScript in HTML output.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration values (jsmath_path), environment data (math domain), and data from nodes (math content).",
  "sinks": "Adding JavaScript files to the HTML builder for rendering math, appending HTML tags, and encoding math text for output.",
  "flows": "Configuration check → Loading math domain → Conditionally injecting JS file → Rendering math nodes into HTML output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of standard Sphinx extension setup functions and safe HTML encoding. No obfuscated code, external network calls, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily functions as a Sphinx extension to render math using JavaScript. It performs configuration validation, adds necessary JavaScript files, and renders math nodes as HTML. There are no suspicious dynamic code executions, network communications, or data leaks. The code uses standard libraries and APIs, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate Sphinx extension setup for math rendering with no signs of malicious behavior. It adheres to expected patterns for such extensions and does not contain any malware or security threats.",
