      "conclusion": "The extension is safe internally, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main risk stems from external script loading via user-controlled configuration, which is typical but warrants trust in the configuration source. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is approximately 0.2, reflecting moderate concern due to external resource inclusion."
