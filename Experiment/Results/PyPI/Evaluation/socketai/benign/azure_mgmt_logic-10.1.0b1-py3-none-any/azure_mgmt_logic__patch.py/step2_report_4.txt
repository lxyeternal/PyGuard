  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code is a standard, well-commented template with a license header.\n- It defines a single function `patch_sdk()` which is empty (no implementation).\n- The code contains no data processing, input/output, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n- The code is a minimal placeholder, serving as a template for user customization.\n- No malicious or suspicious code is present.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No issues are present in the code.** It is benign and standard for SDK extension points.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic or Reasoning**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a placeholder/template with no operational logic.\n- They consistently state the absence of data flows, sources, sinks, anomalies, or suspicious patterns.\n- The reports' reasoning aligns with the code's content.\n\n**Potential concern:**  \n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- The reports also assign a security risk score of 0, which is justified.\n\n**No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports.**\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Correct, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** 0 — Correct, no malware present.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — Correct, no security issues.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \n- The scores seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**\n- The risk scores are all 0, which is justified.\n- The code is a benign placeholder with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n**No justification needed for higher scores.**\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware Score Reflection**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's nature.\n- No malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as a simple placeholder.\n- No overreach in their analysis.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n- All scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are high (1.0), which is appropriate given the straightforward analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — The code is entirely benign.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk.\n\n**Overall:**  \nThe reports correctly identify the code as a benign, standard SDK placeholder with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, benign placeholder for SDK extensions.\n- All reports' reasoning and scoring are appropriate.\n- No changes to the scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores reflect this accurately.",
