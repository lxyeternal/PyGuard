{
  "purpose": "The code provides a template or placeholder for handwritten extensions to a generated SDK, specifically a patch function.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in the code.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the function is a no-op.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows since the function does nothing and there are no data inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard, well-documented template with licensing comments. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script contains licensing and documentation comments followed by a single empty function 'patch_sdk'. The function does not perform any operations, data processing, or I/O. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The purpose seems to be to serve as a placeholder for future code customization. No sources, sinks, or flows indicate malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder template for SDK extension with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified.",
