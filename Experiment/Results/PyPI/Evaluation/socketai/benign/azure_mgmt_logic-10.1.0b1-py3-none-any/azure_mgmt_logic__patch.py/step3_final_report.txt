{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a placeholder for handwritten extensions to generated SDK code, allowing developers to customize or patch SDK behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it contains only a function definition with no parameters or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function is empty and does not process any data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a minimal, standard template with no suspicious or unusual elements; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, boilerplate placeholder with licensing comments and an empty function intended for user customization. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or contain any malicious logic. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate no security risks or malicious intent. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless SDK extension placeholder with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
