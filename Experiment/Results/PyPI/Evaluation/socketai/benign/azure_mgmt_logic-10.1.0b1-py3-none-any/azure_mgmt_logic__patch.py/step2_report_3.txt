  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal, boilerplate placeholder with no actual logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - The code does not read input, write output, or perform any operations.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n   - The code is benign and serves as a template for user customization.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The reports assign a security risk of 0, which is justified.\n   - The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent.\n   - The code is a placeholder with no dynamic or suspicious behavior.\n   - Therefore, risk scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign assessment.\n   - No evidence of malicious activity or hidden payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a standard, harmless template.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code’s content and the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final System Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\nThe code is a straightforward, standard placeholder with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign, serving as a template for SDK extensions.  \n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.  \n- Scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware and risk.",
