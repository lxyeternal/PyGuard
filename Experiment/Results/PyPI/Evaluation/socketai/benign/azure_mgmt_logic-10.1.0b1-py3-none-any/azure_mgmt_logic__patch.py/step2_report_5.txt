  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a minimal, boilerplate placeholder with no logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - The code contains only an empty function `patch_sdk()` with licensing comments.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are evident.\n   - No evidence of code that could be used maliciously or that performs any suspicious activity.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a benign template intended for user customization.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The high confidence is justified because the code is straightforward, well-documented, and contains no suspicious elements.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is a simple, empty placeholder with no logic, no data flow, and no external dependencies or secrets, the overall security risk should remain very low.\n   - The risk score should stay at 0 or very close to it, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - There is no indication of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a benign template.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed without evidence.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, harmless SDK extension placeholder.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
