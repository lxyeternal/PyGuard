  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code presence and logic**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal, boilerplate placeholder function (`patch_sdk`) with no operational logic.\n   - There are no signs of data input/output, external communication, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is standard for SDK customization points, with licensing comments and an empty function body.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the code is benign and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and their reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious activity.\n   - The `malware` score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious intent.\n   - The `obfuscated` score of 0 is correct since the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n   - The `securityRisk` score of 0 is justified as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5**:\n   - No issues warrant a higher risk score. The code is clearly a benign placeholder.\n   - The reports correctly assign a risk of 0, indicating no security concern.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n   - There is no malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a template for SDK extension with no malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the reports' analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is a standard SDK extension placeholder with no embedded malicious logic.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
