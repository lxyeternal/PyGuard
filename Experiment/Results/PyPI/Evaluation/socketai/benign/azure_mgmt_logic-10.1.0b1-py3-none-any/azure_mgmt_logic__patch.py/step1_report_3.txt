  "purpose": "The code provides a template for handwritten extensions to a generated SDK, serving as a placeholder for custom modifications.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input, as the code contains only a function definition with no implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and appears to be a standard template. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-commented placeholder function with licensing and licensing-related comments. It does not perform any operations, data processing, or external interactions. No sources or sinks are involved, and there are no unusual or suspicious code patterns. The purpose is to serve as a customizable extension point, with no embedded or hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a template for future extensions. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. Overall, it is safe.",
