  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the details:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple, boilerplate placeholder with an empty function `patch_sdk()`.\n   - There are no signs of code execution, data processing, or external input/output.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment; they correctly classify the code as benign, standard, and non-malicious.\n   - No logical errors or misleading claims are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly reflecting the straightforward, un-obfuscated code.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the absence of any vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - No report assigns a risk score above 0.5; all are 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - Therefore, no adjustment is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a harmless template.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's content.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a standard placeholder with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code is a benign, boilerplate template intended for user customization. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
