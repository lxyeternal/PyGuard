{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to serve as a placeholder for handwritten extensions to generated SDK code, specifically for patching or customizing SDK behavior.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs to untrusted locations; the function is a no-op.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths exist within this code as it contains only a placeholder function that does nothing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. The code contains standard licensing comments and a simple, empty function.",
  "analysis": "The code includes licensing and copyright comments followed by a simple function definition 'patch_sdk' which currently performs no operations. There are no data inputs, outputs, or side effects. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious activity is present. The structure and content appear to be typical for SDK customization points.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder for SDK patching with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, non-malicious template with no harmful intent.",
