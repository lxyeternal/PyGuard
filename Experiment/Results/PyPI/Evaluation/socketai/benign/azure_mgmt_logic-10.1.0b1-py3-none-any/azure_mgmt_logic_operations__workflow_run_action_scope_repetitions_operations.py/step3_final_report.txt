{
  "purpose": "The code constructs HTTP requests for managing Azure Logic Apps workflow run action scope repetitions, including listing and retrieving specific repetitions, and handles responses accordingly.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as resource group name, workflow name, run name, action name, repetition name, subscription ID, and optional headers and params; URL templates and query parameters.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request execution and response processing; deserialization of responses; error handling via exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to format URLs and query parameters; requests are built via helper functions; requests are sent through the pipeline; responses are deserialized and errors are mapped; data is returned to caller.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity; standard SDK boilerplate code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SDK implementation for Azure Logic Apps, constructing REST API requests with proper URL formatting, query parameters, and headers. It includes request builders, response deserialization, error handling, and pagination support. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.1 accurately reflects the low inherent risk of SDK code interacting with cloud services. The high confidence scores (0.9-0.95) are justified given the code's structure and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured SDK boilerplate for Azure Logic Apps management, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The assigned scores are consistent and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
