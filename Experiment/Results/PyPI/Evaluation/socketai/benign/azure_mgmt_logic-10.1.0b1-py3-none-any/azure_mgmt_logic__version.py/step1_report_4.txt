  "anomalies": "Presence of a version string with a 'b' (beta) indicating pre-release, but no malicious indicators",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple header with licensing info and a version string assignment. There are no input, output, or processing functions. The version string suggests a pre-release but is not suspicious in itself. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to define a version identifier. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
