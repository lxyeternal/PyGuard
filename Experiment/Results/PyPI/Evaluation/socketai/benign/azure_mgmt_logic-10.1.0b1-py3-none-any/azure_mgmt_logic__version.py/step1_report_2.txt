  "purpose": "Define a version string for the package or module.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignment for VERSION variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data flow.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; presence of licensing and autogenerated comments, but no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple header with licensing comments, copyright info, and a version string assignment. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or input/output operations. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. It appears to be auto-generated boilerplate code establishing a version identifier.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a version identifier with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
