{
  "purpose": "Define the package or module version as a static string.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the VERSION variable; licensing comments and autogenerated notices.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; static assignment with no external input.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code contains only a static variable assignment and comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated boilerplate with no dynamic or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static declaration of a version string with licensing comments, generated by an automated tool. There are no functions, data processing, input/output, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's benign and static nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose is purely informational, serving as a version identifier in a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify its static, auto-generated nature and assign appropriate scores. No further action or concern is necessary.",
