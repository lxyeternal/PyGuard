  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is boilerplate SDK setup, with safe import patterns, no untrusted data handling, and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The confidence is high (1).\n- **Assessment:** No issues. The code is standard SDK initialization.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with mention of wildcard import (*), which could be risky but is common in generated code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (minor risk due to wildcard import). Confidence slightly lower (0.9).\n- **Assessment:** The wildcard import is a minor concern but not malicious. No untrusted data or network activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, with focus on the wildcard import and extension of __all__, which could be misused if the module is compromised.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 2, minor concern over wildcard import but overall safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Highlights the potential risk of executing arbitrary code via `_patch_sdk()` if `_patch` is malicious or compromised.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, but emphasizes that this pattern is common and trusted in SDKs.\n- **Assessment:** The call to `_patch_sdk()` is standard but does pose a slight risk if the `_patch` module is compromised. However, given the source (Microsoft), this is unlikely.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with focus on import patterns and patching. No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Very low risk, standard SDK setup.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Justification:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code is auto-generated SDK boilerplate.\n- **Wildcard Import Risks:** While wildcard imports can be risky, in the context of generated SDK code, they are common and generally safe, assuming the source is trustworthy.\n- **Execution of `_patch_sdk()`:** This could be a vector if `_patch` were malicious, but given the source (Microsoft), this is standard and unlikely to be malicious.\n- **Obfuscation & Hardcoded Secrets:** None present.\n- **External Data/Network:** No external data handling or network activity observed.\n\n### Adjusted Scores & Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** Remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** Given the standard pattern and source, I would assign a **risk score of 0.1** to reflect the minor concern about wildcard import and patch execution, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  | Justification |\n|-----------|--------------|--------|--------------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0.1** | No malicious intent, standard SDK pattern, minor concern over wildcard import and patch execution, which are typical in generated code from a reputable source. |\n\n**Overall, I conclude this code is safe and does not pose security risks.**",
