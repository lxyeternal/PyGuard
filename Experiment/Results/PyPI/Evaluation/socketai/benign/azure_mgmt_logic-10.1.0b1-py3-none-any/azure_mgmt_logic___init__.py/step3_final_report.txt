{
  "purpose": "This code initializes the SDK by importing core modules, managing versioning, and applying optional patches. It serves as boilerplate setup code for the SDK environment.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (_logic_management_client, _version, _patch), and the execution of _patch_sdk() after importing _patch.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; the flow involves importing modules, setting version info, conditionally importing and extending __all__, and executing _patch_sdk() which may execute code from _patch.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import 'from ._patch import *' and the execution of _patch_sdk() could be points of concern if the _patch module is compromised, but these are standard in generated SDK code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SDK bootstrap pattern with safe import practices, version management, and optional patching. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The wildcard import and execution of _patch_sdk() are common but could pose risks if the source is compromised. The overall structure is straightforward, with no external data handling or network activity. The confidence in benign intent is high, and the risk is minimal but slightly above zero due to dynamic execution points.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard SDK initialization boilerplate with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minor risk associated with dynamic import and patch execution is acceptable in the context of a trusted SDK from Microsoft. Overall, it is safe and does not pose security threats.",
