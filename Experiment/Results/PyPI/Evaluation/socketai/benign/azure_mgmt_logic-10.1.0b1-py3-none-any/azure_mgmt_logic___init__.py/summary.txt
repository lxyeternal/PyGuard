  "conclusion": "The code is standard SDK initialization boilerplate with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minor risk associated with dynamic import and patch execution is acceptable in the context of a trusted SDK from Microsoft. Overall, it is safe and does not pose security threats."
