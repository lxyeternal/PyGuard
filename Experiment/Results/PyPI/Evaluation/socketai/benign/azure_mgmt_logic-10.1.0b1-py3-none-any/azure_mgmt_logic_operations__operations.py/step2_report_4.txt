  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe a standard SDK client component for listing Azure Logic operations.\n- No mention of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious URL patterns.\n- The code employs standard Azure SDK practices: request building, pagination, error mapping, deserialization.\n- No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), indicating minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: it constructs GET requests, handles pagination via `next_link`, and maps errors.\n- No evidence of code that could be malicious or obfuscated.\n- No hardcoded credentials or secrets.\n- The code is generated and follows standard patterns.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The code's flow and error handling appear correct.\n- The request building, URL parsing, and response processing are standard.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the low potential for security issues, scores around 0.1-0.2 are reasonable.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports suggest any activity that warrants a higher risk score.\n- The code is a standard SDK component, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code's nature.\n- The scores assigned seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1-0.2 (low, typical for SDK code)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a typical auto-generated SDK client, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The request construction and handling are standard, with no suspicious URL manipulations or data handling.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the provided scores. The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk scores are justified given the context.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: ~0.1-0.2 (consistent with SDK code)",
