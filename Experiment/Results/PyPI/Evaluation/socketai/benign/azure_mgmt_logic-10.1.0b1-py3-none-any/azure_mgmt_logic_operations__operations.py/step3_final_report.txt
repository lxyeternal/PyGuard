  "purpose": "Client SDK component for listing Azure Logic operations, constructing requests, handling pagination, and error mapping.",
  "sources": "Input parameters, URL templates, headers, and query parameters used to build HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request execution via Azure SDK pipeline, response deserialization, and error handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into request construction; requests are sent over network; responses are deserialized and processed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, suspicious URLs, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK client for Azure Logic, employing typical request building, pagination, and error handling patterns. It uses URL parsing and request serialization without any signs of malicious payloads, code injection, or backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscation are present. The network activity is limited to legitimate API calls. Error mapping and response deserialization follow best practices. Overall, the code appears benign and aligns with standard SDK implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated Azure SDK client component for listing operations. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk (around 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
