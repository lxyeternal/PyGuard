{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for interacting with Azure Logic Management API to list available operations, handling request building, pagination, and error mapping.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, headers, URL parameters, and constructed request objects.",
  "sinks": "Uses the constructed HttpRequest objects to make HTTP requests via the Azure client pipeline. Response handling includes deserialization and error raising.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> build_list_request() -> HttpRequest -> pipeline.run() -> response -> deserialization and error mapping",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. Use of standard Azure SDK libraries and conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard SDK-generated code for Azure management operations. It constructs HTTP requests for listing operations, handles pagination via 'next_link', and processes responses with error handling. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The libraries used are typical for Azure SDKs, and no obfuscated or suspicious logic was detected. The code is primarily focused on API interaction, with proper error handling and request preparation. It does not contain any network calls outside the SDK context or attempts to access sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, generated SDK component for Azure logic operations management. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected API request/response handling without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
