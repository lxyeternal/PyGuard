  "purpose": "A minimal SDK customization template allowing user-specific modifications without active logic.",
  "sources": "No data input, external data sources, or runtime data processing.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external communication, or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; static code with no dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static template with comments, import statements, an empty list, and a placeholder function. It contains no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions. All indicators point to benign, intended-for-user-customization code. No anomalies or suspicious features are present, and the code does not pose any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SDK customization stub with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
