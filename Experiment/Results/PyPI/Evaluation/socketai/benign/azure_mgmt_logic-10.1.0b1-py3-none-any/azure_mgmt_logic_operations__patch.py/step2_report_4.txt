  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n1. **Code Analysis:**\n   - The code is a minimal SDK customization template.\n   - It contains only comments, import statements, a list declaration, and an empty function `patch_sdk()`.\n   - No dynamic code, external data handling, or I/O operations.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n   - The code is straightforward and intended for user customization.\n\n2. **Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - Obfuscation is correctly scored as 0, given the code's clarity.\n\n3. **Security Risk Score:**\n   - The code poses no security risk; it is a static template.\n   - All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment, emphasizing the benign and template nature.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent based on assumptions.\n   - The purpose of the code and the lack of any suspicious activity justify the low scores.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n   - The code is safe, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n   - The risk scores are appropriately low, and malware/obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
