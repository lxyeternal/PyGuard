  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, straightforward SDK customization template.\n- It contains no dynamic behavior, no external data input, no network or file operations.\n- The `patch_sdk()` function is a placeholder for user modifications.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- The code matches the description: a simple template with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- No evidence of malicious code, data flows, or external data handling.\n- The code is consistent across reports.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n- The scoring aligns with the code's nature: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Conclusion:** No flaws or mistakes in the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These are appropriate given the code's content.\n- The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- The code is a benign template with no malicious behavior, so a risk score of 0 is justified.\n- No potential vulnerabilities are suggested, only a placeholder for user customization.\n\n**Conclusion:** No justification for higher risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- No malicious activity, code, or behavior is present.\n\n**Conclusion:** Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:\n\n- The reports correctly assume no vulnerabilities, as the code does not process data, perform I/O, or execute logic.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made; the analysis is based on the code content.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessments are sound.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on all the above, my own estimates are:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall:** The code is a benign, standard SDK customization template with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- The code is safe and intentionally minimal.\n- No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further analysis or have other reports to review.",
