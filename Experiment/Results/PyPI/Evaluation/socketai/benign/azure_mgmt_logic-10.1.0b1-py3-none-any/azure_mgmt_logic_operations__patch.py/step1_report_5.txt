  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could be exploited or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows present in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only placeholder functions and comments, with no suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple template with a licensing comment, import statement, an empty list, and a function `patch_sdk()` meant for future customization. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications. The structure and content are standard for SDK customization files and contain no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign SDK customization template with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a placeholder for user modifications and does not contain any suspicious or harmful code.",
