  "purpose": "This code serves as a template for customizing generated SDK code, providing a placeholder function for modifications.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string and list variables, imports a standard typing module, and defines a function with no external data input.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only template comments and placeholder functions with no active or suspicious behavior; no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal template for SDK customization with clear comments and no executable or harmful logic. It does not perform any input/output operations, network access, or data manipulation. The 'patch_sdk' function is a stub for future modifications. There are no anomalies, suspicious code segments, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template for SDK customization with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
