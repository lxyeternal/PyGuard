  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal, standard SDK customization template.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is identified.\n- The `patch_sdk()` function is a placeholder for user modifications, with no active logic.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: a simple template with license comments, import statements, an `__all__` variable, and an empty function.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- The code is benign and intended for user customization.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is consistent with the code content.\n- The confidence scores are high (1.0), appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or anomalies:**\n- There are no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or code that could be exploited.\n- The code does not perform any I/O, network, or system operations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign SDK template with no security risks.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent, and the code is safe. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign SDK customization stub with no malicious or risky features. The scoring aligns with the code's nature.",
