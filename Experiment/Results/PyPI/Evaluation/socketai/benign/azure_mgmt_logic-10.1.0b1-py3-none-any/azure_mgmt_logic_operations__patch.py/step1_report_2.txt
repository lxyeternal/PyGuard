  "purpose": "The code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code for Microsoft Azure, with no specific functionality implemented.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code does not read data or user input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths present; the code is primarily a placeholder with an empty function.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of license comments and a placeholder function; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, well-structured template with license headers and a single function intended for future customization. It does not process data, perform I/O, or execute any logic that could lead to security issues. There are no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. The code appears to be a safe, intentional stub for further development.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a placeholder for SDK customization and does not perform any harmful operations.",
