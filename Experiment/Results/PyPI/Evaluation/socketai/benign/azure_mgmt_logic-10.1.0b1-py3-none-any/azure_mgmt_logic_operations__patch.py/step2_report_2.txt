  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a minimal, straightforward SDK customization template.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The `patch_sdk()` function is a placeholder for user customization, with no active logic or external interactions.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is static, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external communication.\n- The license comments and import statements are standard.\n- The `__all__` variable is an empty list, which is typical for a stub or template.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware score: all reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated: all assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Security risk: all assign 0, matching the lack of any risky operations.\n\n**Any issues or discrepancies?**\n- No issues detected; the assessments are consistent and justified.\n- The confidence levels are all at 1, appropriate given the clear benign nature.\n- No claims are made based on assumptions; the analysis is based on code inspection.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign SDK customization template with no malicious activity or security concerns.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final justification:**\nThe code is a standard, minimal template with no dynamic behavior, no external data handling, and no suspicious constructs. The reports' assessments are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, benign, and intended for user customization.\n- The scores are correct and justified.\n- No further action needed.",
