{
  "purpose": "The code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code, with a placeholder function `patch_sdk()` for user modifications.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; only imports and function definitions are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely structural and definitional.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The `patch_sdk()` function is a placeholder for user customization but contains no malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard comments, a license notice, an import statement, and an empty list declaration. The `patch_sdk()` function is documented as a customization point. There is no runtime logic, no external data handling, and no malicious constructs present. The code appears to be a standard template or stub for further customization, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template for SDK customization with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It is likely part of a larger SDK codebase intended for user modifications.",
