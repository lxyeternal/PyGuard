      "conclusion": "The code is a standard serialization/deserialization utility with no malicious intent. The main security concern is the use of 'eval' for type conversions, which could be exploited if 'data_type' is influenced by untrusted input. No evidence of sabotage or backdoors is found. The malware score is appropriate at 0, but the security risk should be increased to reflect the potential for code injection via 'eval'."

Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
