  "conclusion": "The code is benign, utility SDK functions with no malicious intent or security issues. The unusual exception handling is benign and does not warrant a higher risk score. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
