  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting and formatting HTTP requests and URLs, likely for use within an SDK or API client.",
  "sources": "request.content, request.method, request.url, request.headers, request (input parameters), template, kwargs",
  "sinks": "HttpRequest constructor, request.set_formdata_body, string formatting with template.format()",
  "flows": "request.content -> HttpRequest data, template + kwargs -> formatted URL string",
  "anomalies": "The URL formatting function `_format_url_section` attempts to handle KeyError by modifying the template string, which could potentially mask URL template issues or lead to malformed URLs if used improperly. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: `_convert_request`, which constructs a new HttpRequest object with optional file attachments, and `_format_url_section`, which formats a URL template with provided keyword arguments. The first function performs straightforward request object reconstruction without user input handling, which is standard. The second function handles URL formatting with exception handling for missing keys; it attempts to remove URL components with missing keys. The code does not perform any network communication, data leakage, or include malicious logic. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard utility for request handling and URL formatting with no malicious intent or security risks. The URL formatting function's exception handling could be unusual but does not pose a security threat. Overall, the code is benign.",
