  "purpose": "Utility functions for constructing HTTP requests and formatting URL templates within an SDK context.",
  "sources": "Request object content, URL template strings, and provided keyword arguments for URL formatting.",
  "sinks": "Creation of HttpRequest objects, setting form data, and URL string formatting; no untrusted data leaks or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input request content and files flow into HttpRequest object; URL templates and kwargs flow into string formatting functions, with exception handling managing missing keys.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual try-except logic in `_format_url_section` that attempts to handle missing keys by removing URL components; no malicious intent but somewhat complex and potentially obscure.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward utility code with functions for request creation and URL formatting. No malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The exception handling in `_format_url_section` is unconventional but benign, aimed at handling missing keys gracefully. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Malware scores are correctly set to 0; security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the benign nature. The anomaly in URL formatting is noted but not harmful. Overall, the code is safe, with scores aligned with its utility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, utility SDK functions with no malicious intent or security issues. The unusual exception handling is benign and does not warrant a higher risk score. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
