  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Azure SDK configuration class with no indications of supply chain attack, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily due to credential handling, which is standard practice. No modifications are necessary."
