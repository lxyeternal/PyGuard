  "purpose": "Standard SDK configuration class for Azure Logic Management Client, handling credentials, policies, and API versioning.",
  "sources": "Credential object, subscription_id parameter, optional kwargs for policies and settings.",
  "sinks": "Attributes such as self.credential, self.subscription_id, self.api_version, and instantiated policies.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class attributes; policies are instantiated with these attributes or default values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured SDK configuration class. It validates essential parameters, sets default values, and initializes various policies using standard Azure SDK patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. Credential handling is standard, with validation to prevent null inputs. The code relies on official SDK modules and follows best practices for configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Azure SDK configuration class with no indications of supply chain attack, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily due to credential handling, which is standard practice. No modifications are necessary.",
