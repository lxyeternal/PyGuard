  "purpose": "Defines configuration class for Azure Logic Management Client, setting up credentials, policies, and client parameters.",
  "sources": "Credential input parameter, subscription_id parameter, keyword arguments for policies and configuration.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink if credentials or tokens are mishandled or leaked, but no explicit data leakage or network activity is present in this code.",
  "flows": "Credential and configuration parameters flow through class initialization, setting policies and authentication mechanisms.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code is standard for SDK configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a configuration class, initializes required parameters, and sets up various policies. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are detected. The credential handling is standard, with validation for None values. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation present. The structure and imports are typical for SDK setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign configuration class for an Azure management client. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are identified.",
