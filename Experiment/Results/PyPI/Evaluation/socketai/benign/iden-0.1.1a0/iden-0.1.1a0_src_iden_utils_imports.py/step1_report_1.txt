{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to check for, verify, and conditionally execute code based on the presence of optional dependencies ('cloudpickle', 'joblib', 'safetensors', 'yaml').",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially 'find_spec' from 'importlib.util' for detecting package availability, and 'decorator_package_available' for conditional execution decorators.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not perform any data output or side effects based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking package availability via 'find_spec', raising errors or conditionally executing functions based on these checks, and applying decorators for optional execution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or malicious code behaviors such as hidden network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code strictly handles package availability checks and decorators for conditional function execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a custom 'decorator_package_available' to create functions that check for the presence of specific optional packages. It uses 'find_spec' to detect if packages are installed without executing or importing them fully, minimizing risk. The functions raise RuntimeErrors if dependencies are missing and provide decorators for conditional execution based on package availability. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is detected; all functions are straightforward and serve well-understood purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of optional dependency checks and conditional decorators, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It strictly manages dependencies and provides safe mechanisms for optional features.",
