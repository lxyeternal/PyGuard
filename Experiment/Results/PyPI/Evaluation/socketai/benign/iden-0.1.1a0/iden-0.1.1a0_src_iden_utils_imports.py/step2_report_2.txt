  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code provides functions to check for optional dependencies ('cloudpickle', 'joblib', 'safetensors', 'yaml') using `find_spec`.\n- It includes functions to enforce presence (`check_*`) and decorators (`*_available`) for conditional execution.\n- The use of `decorator_package_available` (assumed to be a standard decorator) suggests safe conditional wrapping.\n- No data processing, external communications, or obfuscated code is present.\n- The code is straightforward, dependency management-focused, and does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code accurately checks for package presence without importing or executing potentially unsafe code.\n- No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The functions and decorators are standard patterns for optional dependencies.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or security issues are apparent.\n- The only minor point is that the code relies on `find_spec`, which is safe for detection but does not guarantee the package's correctness or integrity. However, this is standard practice.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5. Since the code only manages dependencies and does not execute untrusted code, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk score:\n- The code does not execute or import the dependencies directly; it only checks their presence.\n- The decorators are wrappers that execute only if dependencies are available.\n- No external network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.\n- Therefore, a risk score of **0** is appropriate.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment that the code is benign and standard for dependency management.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is well-structured, with clear purpose and no signs of malicious intent.\n- The use of `find_spec` is appropriate and safe for dependency detection.\n- The decorators rely on an external, presumably well-tested, `decorator_package_available`.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe implementation for optional dependency checks and conditional execution. No security risks or malware are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Risk             | 0              |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the purpose of the code.",
