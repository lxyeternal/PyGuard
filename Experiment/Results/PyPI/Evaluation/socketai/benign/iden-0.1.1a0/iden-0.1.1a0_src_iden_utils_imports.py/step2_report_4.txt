  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a utility module that checks for optional dependencies ('cloudpickle', 'joblib', 'safetensors', 'yaml') using `find_spec`.\n- It provides functions to verify presence, raise errors if missing, and decorators to conditionally execute functions.\n- The implementation is straightforward, relying on standard Python practices.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code behaviors are evident.\n- The use of `decorator_package_available` from an external module appears to be a common pattern for conditional decorators.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Observations:\n- The code only performs dependency checks.\n- No data leaks, network activity, or code execution beyond import checks.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The logic is clear, and the scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.\n\n### Specific Points:\n- The `find_spec` method is a safe way to check for package presence without importing.\n- Raising `RuntimeError` when dependencies are missing is standard.\n- Decorators are used to wrap functions conditionally, which is a common pattern.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The only external function used is `decorator_package_available`, which is assumed to be safe. If this function had malicious behavior, it would be a concern, but given its naming and typical usage, it is likely benign.\n- No assumptions about malicious behavior are justified based on this code alone.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** 0. No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0. The code is transparent and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0. Since the code only performs dependency checks and conditional execution, the risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's content.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe dependency management utility with no security concerns.",
