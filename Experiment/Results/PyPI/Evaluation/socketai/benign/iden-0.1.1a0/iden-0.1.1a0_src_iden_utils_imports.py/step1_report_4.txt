{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to check and import optional dependencies ('cloudpickle', 'joblib', 'safetensors', 'yaml') in a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the environment via 'find_spec' to determine if packages are installed; also imports from 'coola.utils.imports'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; functions raise RuntimeError if dependencies are missing, but do not perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "The functions flow from checking package availability via 'find_spec' to optional decorators or exception raising based on presence.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors; the code performs standard dependency checks and decorators for optional imports. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module that checks for optional dependencies using 'importlib.util.find_spec'. It defines functions to verify package availability, raise errors if missing, and decorators to conditionally enable functions. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or privacy violations are present. It follows standard practices for optional dependency management without any suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focused solely on dependency checking and optional decorators. No malicious or security-compromising behavior observed.",
