{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to check for the presence of optional dependencies ('cloudpickle', 'joblib', 'safetensors', 'yaml') and decorators to conditionally execute functions based on their availability.",
  "sources": "Uses 'find_spec' from 'importlib.util' to detect if packages are installed.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Dependency check functions call 'find_spec'; decorators wrap functions to execute only if dependencies are available.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behaviors; straightforward dependency management.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dependency detection using 'find_spec', raises errors if dependencies are missing, and provides decorators for conditional execution. It relies on an external 'decorator_package_available' for wrapping functions. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious logic is present. The implementation is transparent, with no network activity or data leaks. The functions are safe and typical for dependency management modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for managing optional dependencies with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware and obfuscation, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
