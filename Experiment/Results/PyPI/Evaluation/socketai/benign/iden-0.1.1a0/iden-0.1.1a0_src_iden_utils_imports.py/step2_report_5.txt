  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code's purpose is to provide utility functions for checking optional dependencies ('cloudpickle', 'joblib', 'safetensors', 'yaml') and decorators for conditional execution.\n- It relies on `find_spec` from `importlib.util` to detect whether packages are installed, which is a safe and standard approach.\n- The functions raise `RuntimeError` if dependencies are missing, and decorators are used to wrap functions to execute only if dependencies are present.\n- The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execute untrusted code beyond standard dependency checks.\n- The `decorator_package_available` is imported from an external module, but assuming it is well-implemented, it likely wraps functions conditionally based on the availability check.\n\n**Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n\n- No evidence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n- The code strictly manages optional dependencies and conditional execution.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is clear, straightforward, and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or lower is appropriate, given the code's purpose. Since it only checks dependencies and conditionally runs functions, the risk is minimal.\n\n**Potential issues or points of critique:**\n\n- The use of `decorator_package_available` from an external module is assumed safe; if that function is malicious or poorly implemented, it could introduce risks. However, in standard practice, such decorators are safe.\n- The code does not import the optional packages directly, avoiding unnecessary risks.\n- No assumptions about the external decorator's implementation are provided, but it's a common pattern.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of optional dependency checks and conditional decorators.\n- No signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (since it's low but not zero, considering possible external decorator issues, but generally safe)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and serves a common purpose in dependency management. No security concerns are evident.",
