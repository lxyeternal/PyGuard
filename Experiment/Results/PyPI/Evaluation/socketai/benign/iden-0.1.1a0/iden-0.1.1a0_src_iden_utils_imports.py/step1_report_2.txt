{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to check for and conditionally execute code based on the availability of optional dependencies ('cloudpickle', 'joblib', 'safetensors', 'yaml') in a Python environment.",
  "sources": "Checks for the presence of specific packages using 'find_spec' from 'importlib.util'. Calls to 'find_spec' serve as source points for detecting dependency availability.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the 'decorator_package_available' function, which wraps user-defined functions to execute only if dependencies are present. No data leaks, external communications, or system modifications are observed.",
  "flows": "Source: 'find_spec' checks for package presence -> Decision: availability functions return boolean -> Decorators wrap functions to execute conditionally based on availability.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of 'decorator_package_available' is standard for conditional execution based on package presence.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically checks for optional dependencies using 'find_spec' and provides functions to enforce their presence or conditionally run code via decorators. The approach is straightforward and commonly used in Python package management. No external network operations, file manipulations, or malicious behavior are present. The code functions solely for dependency management and does not include any hidden or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for managing optional package dependencies with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It performs dependency checks and wraps functions for conditional execution in a typical, transparent manner.",
