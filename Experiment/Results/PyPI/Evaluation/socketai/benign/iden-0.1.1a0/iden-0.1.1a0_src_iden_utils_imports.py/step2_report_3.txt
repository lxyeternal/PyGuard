  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are present, assess the reasoning, and assign appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a collection of utility functions that check for the presence of optional dependencies ('cloudpickle', 'joblib', 'safetensors', 'yaml') using `find_spec`.\n- It provides functions to raise errors if dependencies are missing and decorators to conditionally execute functions only if dependencies are available.\n- The implementation relies on standard practices: `find_spec` for detection, and a custom `decorator_package_available` for decorators.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code is evident. The code performs dependency management in a straightforward, transparent manner.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Issues:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All functions are consistent with the described purpose. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n- **Are the logical flows correct?**  \n  **Yes.** The flow from dependency detection to error raising or conditional execution is logical and standard.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The use of `find_spec` is safe and standard for dependency detection.\n- The `decorator_package_available` function is assumed to be a well-implemented decorator that wraps functions conditionally; no suspicious behavior is implied.\n- No code obfuscation, hidden network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.\n- The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n  No malicious code or behaviors detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n  Code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Security risk score:** 0  \n  No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven all the above, I would assign the following scores:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard dependency management utility with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is safe, well-implemented, and contains no security risks or malware. The dependency checks and decorators are standard and transparent.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nI concur with the provided scores and assessments. The code is benign and does not pose security concerns.",
