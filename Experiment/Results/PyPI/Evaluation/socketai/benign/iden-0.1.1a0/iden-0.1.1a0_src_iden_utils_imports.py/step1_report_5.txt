{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to check for the availability of optional dependencies ('cloudpickle', 'joblib', 'safetensors', 'yaml') and decorators to conditionally execute functions based on their presence.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'importlib.util' and 'coola.utils.imports'; functions that check package availability using 'find_spec'; decorator_package_available usage; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; functions raise RuntimeError if dependencies are missing; decorators conditionally wrap functions but do not execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Availability check functions ('is_*_available') flow into 'check_*' functions which raise exceptions; decorators ('*_available') use 'decorator_package_available' to conditionally enable functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows standard dependency checking pattern; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward dependency checks and conditional decorators based on package presence, using 'find_spec' to detect installed modules. All functions are designed for dependency management without executing untrusted code or data. No suspicious or malicious code patterns identified. The code structure is standard, with clear separation of checking and decorating functionalities. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for optional dependency management, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs safe checks for package availability and provides decorators to conditionally execute code based on those dependencies. There are no security risks or malware detected.",
