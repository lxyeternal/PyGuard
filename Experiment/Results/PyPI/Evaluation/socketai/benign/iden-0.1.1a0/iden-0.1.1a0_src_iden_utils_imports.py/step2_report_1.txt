  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Logic:**\n   - The code provides functions to check for the presence of optional dependencies (`cloudpickle`, `joblib`, `safetensors`, `yaml`) using `find_spec`.\n   - It includes functions (`check_*`) that raise `RuntimeError` if dependencies are missing.\n   - Decorators (`*_available`) wrap functions to execute only if dependencies are available, via `decorator_package_available`.\n   - The code is straightforward, relies on standard library functions, and does not perform any unsafe operations or data manipulation.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident.\n   - No obfuscated code, hidden payloads, or malicious logic.\n   - The use of `find_spec` avoids importing modules unnecessarily, reducing risk.\n   - The `decorator_package_available` is an external utility presumed to handle conditional execution safely.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — The code is clear, readable, and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — The code only performs dependency checks and conditional decorators; no security vulnerabilities or malicious actions.\n\n4. **Potential Errors or Flaws in the Reports:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as dependency management utilities.\n   - They consistently note the absence of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n5. **Any Changes to Scores?**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The overall risk scores are 0, matching the code's functionality.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The only external dependency is `decorator_package_available`, which should be trusted or reviewed separately, but given its name and typical pattern, it is likely safe.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited maliciously.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, safe utility module for dependency management.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It performs dependency checks and conditional execution wrappers safely and transparently. No modifications to the reported scores are necessary.",
