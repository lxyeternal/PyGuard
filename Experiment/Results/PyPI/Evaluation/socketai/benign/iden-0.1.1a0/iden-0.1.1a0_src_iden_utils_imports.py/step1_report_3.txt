{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to check the availability and importability of optional dependencies ('cloudpickle', 'joblib', 'safetensors', 'yaml') and decorators to conditionally execute functions based on their presence.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`find_spec` from `importlib.util`, `decorator_package_available` from `coola.utils.imports`), functions checking package availability, functions raising errors if packages are missing, decorators wrapping functions to conditionally run.",
  "sinks": "None directly; functions raise RuntimeError if dependencies are missing, and decorators wrap functions but do not perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Code flow involves checking for package presence via `find_spec`, raising errors or returning booleans, and using decorators to conditionally execute functions based on package availability.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code present. Functions simply perform dependency checks and conditional execution.",
  "analysis": "The code implements dependency checks and decorators for optional packages, relying on `find_spec` to detect package presence. It raises clear RuntimeErrors if dependencies are missing and provides decorators to skip function execution if dependencies are absent. There are no signs of code injection, data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The use of `decorator_package_available` from an external module appears to be a standard pattern for conditional decorators, assuming it's well-implemented. The code is structured, with no obfuscated patterns or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for managing optional dependencies with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs dependency detection and conditional function execution safely, with no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
