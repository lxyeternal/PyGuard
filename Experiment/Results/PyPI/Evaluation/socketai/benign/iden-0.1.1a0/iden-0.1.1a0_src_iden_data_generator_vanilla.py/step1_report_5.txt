{
  "purpose": "Implement a simple data generator that returns stored data, optionally as a deep copy.",
  "sources": "The data provided during initialization (`__init__` method), specifically `data` parameter.",
  "sinks": "The `generate` method returns data; if copying is enabled, it performs a `deepcopy` on the data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from `self._data` to the return value, with optional deep copying when `self._copy` is True.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class `DataGenerator` that stores provided data and returns it via the `generate` method, with optional deep copying. The implementation is straightforward, with no user input handling, external network calls, or sensitive data processing. It imports standard modules and a base class but does not perform any risky operations. The class appears to be a utility for testing or data provisioning without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign data generator utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to store and return data, optionally as a deep copy.",
