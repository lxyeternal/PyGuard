{
  "purpose": "Implement a simple data generator that returns provided data, optionally returning a copy.",
  "sources": "Input data provided during class instantiation (self._data).",
  "targets": "Return statement in generate() method, potentially returning data to external callers.",
  "flows": "Data is stored in self._data; generate() method returns either this data directly or a deepcopy if copy is True.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. No external network interactions, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class DataGenerator that inherits from BaseDataGenerator. It initializes with data and a copy flag, and its generate() method returns the data, optionally a deep copy. No untrusted input handling, no external calls, and no malicious logic detected. The implementation appears straightforward and benign, intended solely for data provisioning.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a data generator with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to return provided data, optionally copying it. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
