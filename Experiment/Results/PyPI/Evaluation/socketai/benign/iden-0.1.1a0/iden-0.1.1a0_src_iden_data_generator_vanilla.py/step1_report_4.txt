{
  "purpose": "Implement a simple data generator that returns predefined data, optionally copying it.",
  "sources": "Input data provided during instantiation (parameter 'data').",
  "sinks": "The return value of the generate() method.",
  "flows": "Input data ('data') is stored, and generate() returns either the original data or a deep copy based on the 'copy' flag.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected. The code is straightforward and relies solely on standard library functions and class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class DataGenerator that inherits from BaseDataGenerator. It takes data and a copy flag during initialization. The generate() method returns the stored data, either directly or as a deep copy. There are no inputs from untrusted sources or external environments, no network operations, no file I/O, and no code execution. The implementation appears standard and does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data container with optional copying behavior. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is safe and functions as a straightforward data generator.",
