  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for measuring execution time, including CUDA synchronization and context-managed timing.",
  "sources": "Imports: torch (conditional), time, logging, and utility functions; sync_perf_counter() reads CUDA state if available; timeblock() reads performance counter and logs elapsed time.",
  "sinks": "logger.info in timeblock() outputs timing info; no other sinks handling untrusted data.",
  "flows": "sync_perf_counter() may call torch.cuda.synchronize() which interacts with CUDA driver; timeblock() measures and logs execution time; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns; use of Mock when torch is unavailable is standard for testing or fallback.",
  "analysis": "The code defines timing utility functions with optional CUDA synchronization for performance measurement. The sync_perf_counter() function conditionally calls torch.cuda.synchronize() based on availability and device state, which is standard for timing GPU operations. The timeblock() context manager measures elapsed time and logs it, raising an error if the message format is incorrect. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious code structures. All external interactions are limited to logging and conditional CUDA synchronization, both of which are benign in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for performance timing with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It uses conditional CUDA synchronization for accurate GPU timing and logs results safely. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are present.",
