{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for measuring elapsed time, including a CUDA-aware performance counter and a timing context manager.",
  "sources": "Reads include the imports, the is_torch_available() function, and the sync_perf_counter() and timeblock() functions accessing time, torch, and logging.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the logger.info() call in timeblock() which logs timing information; no untrusted input is explicitly used here.",
  "flows": "sync_perf_counter() checks if torch is available and CUDA is enabled, then synchronizes CUDA streams before returning the perf_counter value; timeblock() records start time, executes code block, then logs elapsed time.",
  "anomalies": "Use of mock for torch when not available is standard; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed. The code appears to be straightforward utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions for measuring performance timing, including CUDA stream synchronization to ensure accurate timings on GPU. It uses safe practices such as optional imports, context managers, and logging. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code execution. The functions do not process untrusted input or perform network operations, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for performance timing with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
