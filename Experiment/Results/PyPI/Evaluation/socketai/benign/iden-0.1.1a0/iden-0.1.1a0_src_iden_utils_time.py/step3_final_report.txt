  "purpose": "Utility functions for measuring elapsed time, including CUDA synchronization and a timing context manager.",
  "sources": "Imports (__future__, time, logging, torch if available, format utils), function calls (torch.cuda.synchronize, time.perf_counter, logger.info).",
  "sinks": "logger.info() outputs timing information; no untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "sync_perf_counter() may call torch.cuda.synchronize() before returning time.perf_counter(); timeblock() measures start time, yields, then logs elapsed time via logger.info().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code; use of Mock for torch is standard; no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward timing utility with optional CUDA sync, designed for performance profiling. It uses standard practices and has no malicious or security-compromising behavior. Logging timing info could leak performance data if logs are insecure, but this is a common and accepted aspect of profiling tools. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and intended for performance measurement. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified due to potential info leakage via logs, which is typical for such utilities.",
