{
  "purpose": "Utility functions to measure time, including synchronized performance counter and execution time measurement context manager.",
  "sources": "Reads include imports from standard libraries, conditional import of torch, and function calls to time.perf_counter() and torch.cuda.synchronize().",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions; no untrusted data processing or output manipulation.",
  "flows": "sync_perf_counter() calls time.perf_counter() and optionally torch.cuda.synchronize() (if torch is available and CUDA is enabled). The timeblock context manager measures elapsed time and logs it via logger.info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is standard utility functions with proper structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines timing utilities, checking for the presence of torch and CUDA, and includes safe logging. No untrusted input is processed, and no network or system manipulation occurs. The conditional import of torch with a mock is a common pattern and does not introduce malicious behavior. The functions serve legitimate performance measurement purposes without any suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for timing measurements. No signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior detected. It does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration.",
