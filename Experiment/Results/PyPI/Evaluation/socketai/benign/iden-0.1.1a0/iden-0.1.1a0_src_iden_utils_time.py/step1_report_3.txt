  "purpose": "Utility functions for measuring execution time, including synchronized CUDA timing and context-managed timing blocks.",
  "sources": "Reads include imported modules, is_torch_available(), and sync_perf_counter() calls which access CUDA streams if available.",
  "sinks": "Logging via logger.info with formatted message including timing info.",
  "flows": "Source: is_torch_available() and torch.cuda.is_available() → sync_perf_counter() → potentially torch.cuda.synchronize() → logs formatted message with timing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Use of Mock for torch when unavailable is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code provides timing utilities with optional CUDA synchronization, which is common in performance measurement tools. No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected. Logging is for informational purposes only. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity present. Usage of unittest.mock.Mock() is standard for handling optional dependencies. No obfuscation or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate performance measurement utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely handles optional CUDA usage and logs execution times. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
