  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to measure time, including synchronization with CUDA and timing code blocks.",
  "sources": [
    "sync_perf_counter() reads system time and optionally synchronizes CUDA kernels.",
    "timeblock() reads system time before and after the code block execution."
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "logger.info() outputs timing information, which could be exploited for information leakage if logs are insecure."
  ],
  "flows": [
    "sync_perf_counter() -> may call torch.cuda.synchronize() -> returns system perf_counter",
    "timeblock() -> calls sync_perf_counter() -> measures elapsed time -> logs formatted message with elapsed time"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of unittest.mock.Mock for torch when not available is benign and standard.",
    "No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or code injection observed.",
    "The logging of timing information is standard for performance measurement; no malicious intent evident.",
    "No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden functionalities detected."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code provides timing utilities with optional CUDA synchronization, which is typical for performance profiling in ML workflows. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code behaviors are present. Use of mock objects is benign and typical for optional dependencies. The logging of performance metrics is expected behavior. No anomalies or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for performance measurement with no malicious intent or security risks. It may leak timing info via logs if logs are improperly secured, but this is a common feature of profiling tools. Overall, the code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
