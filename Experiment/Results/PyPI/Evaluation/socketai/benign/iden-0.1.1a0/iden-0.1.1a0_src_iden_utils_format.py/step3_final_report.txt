  "purpose": "Utility functions for formatting time durations and key-value mappings into strings.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: seconds (float) for human_time; mapping (Mapping) for str_kwargs.",
  "sinks": "None; functions only perform string formatting without external data or system interaction.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are transformed directly into formatted strings without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple utility functions: 'human_time' converts seconds into a timedelta string, and 'str_kwargs' formats a mapping into a key=value string. Both functions operate solely on their inputs, using standard Python libraries, and do not perform any system calls, network activity, or data leaks. The functions are safe, clear, and serve common formatting purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility module for formatting, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
