  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for formatting time durations and string representations of mappings.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function arguments: 'seconds' (float) and 'mapping' (Mapping).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data lead to security-sensitive operations; functions are purely formatting utilities.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into string formatting functions, resulting in formatted string outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs straightforward formatting without any obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two utility functions: 'human_time' converts seconds into a human-readable timedelta string, and 'str_kwargs' creates a string representation of a mapping. Both functions use safe, standard Python libraries and perform simple data transformations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The functions do not process untrusted input in a way that could lead to security issues beyond formatting. No hardcoded credentials, environment variable misuse, or suspicious external interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless utility module intended for formatting purposes. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
