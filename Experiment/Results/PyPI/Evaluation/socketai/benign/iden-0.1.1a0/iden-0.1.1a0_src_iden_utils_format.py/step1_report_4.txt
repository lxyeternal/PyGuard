  "purpose": "Utility functions for formatting time and dictionary representations, primarily used for display or debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Input is taken from function arguments: a float for seconds, and a Mapping object for key-value pairs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows that could lead to security issues; functions merely format and return strings based on inputs.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into formatting functions and is converted into strings, with no external or untrusted data influence or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward utility code for formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two functions: 'human_time' converts a float representing seconds into a human-readable timedelta string, and 'str_kwargs' converts a dictionary-like mapping into a formatted string. Both functions perform safe, purely local data manipulation without external inputs, no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. No dangerous code execution, data leaks, or network activity is observed. The implementation appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is safe for use and does not perform any harmful actions.",
