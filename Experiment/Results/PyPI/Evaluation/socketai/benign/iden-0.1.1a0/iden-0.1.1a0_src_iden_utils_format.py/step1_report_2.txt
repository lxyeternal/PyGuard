  "purpose": "Utility functions for formatting time and string representations of mappings.",
  "sources": "Input mapping in str_kwargs; seconds input in human_time.",
  "sinks": "None identified; functions produce string outputs based on inputs.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from parameters to string formatting functions with no external data interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two formatting functions: 'human_time' which converts seconds into a readable timedelta string, and 'str_kwargs' which formats a mapping into a string suitable for repr or str methods. Both functions rely solely on standard library imports and do not perform external data access, network operations, or insecure handling. The code is straightforward, with clear documentation and no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely utility functions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves standard formatting purposes with no evident vulnerabilities.",
