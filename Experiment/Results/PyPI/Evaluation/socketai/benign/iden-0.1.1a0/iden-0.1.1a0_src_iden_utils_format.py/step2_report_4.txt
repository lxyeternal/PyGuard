  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and scoring consistency.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, safe, and purely for formatting.\n- No external dependencies, network calls, or data leaks are involved.\n- The functions handle inputs safely and produce string outputs without side effects.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Review of Reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identified as utility functions for formatting.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data processing; purely local transformations.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All reports agree on benignity, with no malicious activity or security risks.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n- **malware:** 0 (correct)\n- **securityRisk:** 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### Potential Concerns or Discrepancies:\n- The code does not perform any dangerous operations.\n- The functions could be misused if untrusted data is passed, but since they are formatting utilities, this does not constitute a security risk.\n- The scores assigned (all zeros for malware and obfuscated) are appropriate.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — No security vulnerabilities or risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores are consistent with the analysis. The code is benign, simple, and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify the code as safe utility functions with no security issues. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is perfectly benign and suitable for production use without concerns.",
