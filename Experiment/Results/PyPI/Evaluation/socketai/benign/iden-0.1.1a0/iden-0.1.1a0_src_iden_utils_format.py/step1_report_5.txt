  "purpose": "Utility functions for formatting time and string representations of mappings",
  "sources": "Input to human_time (seconds as float), input to str_kwargs (mapping from __dict__ or other source)",
  "sinks": "None present; functions return formatted strings without untrusted data processing or external calls",
  "flows": "Input data is used solely for formatting and conversion, with no external data sinks or network activity",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs straightforward data formatting, no suspicious code structures or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code provides two utility functions: 'human_time' formats seconds into a human-readable timedelta string; 'str_kwargs' creates a string representation of a mapping. Both functions operate on input data without external side effects, external resource access, or obfuscated code. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or malicious logic are present. The code appears safe and intended solely for formatting purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It safely formats input data into strings for display or debugging.",
