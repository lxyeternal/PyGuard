  "purpose": "Utility functions for formatting time durations and string representations of mappings, primarily for display and debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is taken from function arguments: 'seconds' (float) and 'mapping' (Mapping). No external data sources or untrusted inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "The functions generate string outputs based on the provided inputs. No sinks involving system calls, network, or sensitive data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Input values are transformed into formatted strings: 'human_time' converts a float seconds into a timedelta string; 'str_kwargs' converts a mapping into a formatted string. No untrusted data flow to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs detected. The code is straightforward and self-contained.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two utility functions: 'human_time' converts a float number of seconds into a human-readable timedelta string; 'str_kwargs' formats a mapping into a string suitable for __repr__ or __str__ methods. Both functions perform simple, safe data transformations without external dependencies or system modifications. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions intended for formatting purposes. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The code is safe and suitable for use.",
