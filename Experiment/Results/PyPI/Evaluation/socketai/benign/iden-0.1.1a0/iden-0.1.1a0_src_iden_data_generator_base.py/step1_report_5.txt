  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for data generators, including utility functions for configuration validation and setup.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionaries and class instantiation via factory method.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted configuration data leading to dynamic class instantiation.",
  "flows": "Configuration input -> setup_data_generator() -> factory method -> class instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic class instantiation via factory with configuration data; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class 'BaseDataGenerator' with an abstract method 'generate'. It provides functions to check if a configuration is valid and to set up a generator from a config, utilizing the 'objectory' library's factory pattern. There are no signs of malicious behavior; the factory pattern is standard for plugin-like architectures. No sensitive data handling, code injection, or suspicious external calls are present. The code appears to be a typical framework setup for data generators. No anomalies or indicators of malicious intent are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign framework component for data generation with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
