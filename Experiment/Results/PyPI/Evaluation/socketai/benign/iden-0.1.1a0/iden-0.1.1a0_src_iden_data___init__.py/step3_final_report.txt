  "purpose": "This code snippet is a raw string docstring intended for documentation or descriptive purposes within a Python module.",
  "sources": "The code contains only a string literal, with no input sources, data reads, or external data interactions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is processed or outputted, and no data leaks or effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist, as the code is purely a string comment with no executable logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple raw string docstring with no obfuscation, code execution, or suspicious patterns. No anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single raw string docstring: 'r\"\"\"Contain data related features.\"\"\"'. It contains no executable code, variables, data handling, or logic. All reviews correctly identify that the snippet is only a documentation string with no security implications. The scores assigned across reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. Overall, the code is harmless, serving solely as a descriptive comment or placeholder.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, non-executable documentation string with no security concerns. All reports correctly assess it as safe, with appropriate scoring. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
