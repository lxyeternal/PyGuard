{
  "purpose": "This module appears to serve as an interface or aggregator for data generator implementations, exporting classes and functions related to data generation setup and configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statements for functions and classes from external modules within the 'iden.data.generator' package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling are present in the code. The code does not process or execute external data.",
  "flows": "The module imports classes and functions; no data flow or external data processing occurs within this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines an export list (__all__) and imports classes/functions from other modules. It does not perform any data processing, evaluation, or potentially dangerous operations. The imports suggest modular design, but no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple module aggregator and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. It appears safe.",
