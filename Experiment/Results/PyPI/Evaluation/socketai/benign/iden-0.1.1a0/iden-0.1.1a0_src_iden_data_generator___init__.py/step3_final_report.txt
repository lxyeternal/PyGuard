{
  "purpose": "This module serves as a re-export interface for data generator classes and functions within the 'iden.data.generator' package, organizing exports for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports classes and functions from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module with a docstring, an import of __future__.annotations, an __all__ list, and imports from internal modules. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing. The code's purpose is organizational, exposing classes and functions for external use. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The import statements are from trusted internal modules, and the structure is standard. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module for organizing exports within a package. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
