{
  "purpose": "To define and export data generator classes and configuration functions for data processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'iden.data.generator.base' and 'iden.data.generator.vanilla'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is read from untrusted sources or written to external locations within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing logic is present; only imports and export list.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable logic, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that defines an __all__ list for exports and imports specific classes and functions from internal modules. It contains no data processing, user input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are evident. The module's purpose appears to be simple organization and re-exporting of imported components.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a clean, non-malicious module for re-exporting generator classes and functions. There are no signs of malware or security threats in this snippet.",
