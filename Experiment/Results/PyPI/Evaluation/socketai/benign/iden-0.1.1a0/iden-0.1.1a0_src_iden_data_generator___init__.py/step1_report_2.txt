  "purpose": "This module appears to serve as an interface or configuration setup for data generator classes within the 'iden' package.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'iden.data.generator.base' and 'iden.data.generator.vanilla' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows or untrusted data sources identified.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains import statements and a module-level docstring; no anomalies or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares public symbols via __all__ and imports classes/functions from other modules. There are no data processing, input/output operations, or code execution routines. The presence of __future__ import is standard for compatibility. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. Overall, this seems to be a straightforward module setup with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an import interface for data generator classes. No malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
