{
  "purpose": "To provide a module-level docstring and import specific data generator classes and functions for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Import statements from iden.data.generator.base and iden.data.generator.vanilla",
  "sinks": "No evident sink where untrusted data is processed or output",
  "flows": "The code imports classes and functions; no data flows are visible in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a module docstring indicating it contains data generator implementations. It imports future annotations for compatibility, defines an __all__ list for exports, and imports specific classes/functions from the 'iden.data.generator' package. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The imported modules are from a known package structure, and there are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. It appears to be a standard Python module setup for packaging and exposing components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module initialization script that imports and exposes certain classes and functions. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this snippet.",
