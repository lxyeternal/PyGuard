{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal package-level documentation string, providing no executable logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static string literal used solely as a docstring.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code contains only a static string.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, functions, variables, or data flows; purely a documentation string with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a raw string literal serving as a package docstring with no functions, variables, or executable statements. It does not read input, process data, or perform any actions. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate it is benign, with no security risks or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, non-executable package-level docstring with no malicious intent or security risks. All assessments and scores are correct; no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
  "malware": 0.0,
