  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is solely a raw string literal with a package-level docstring.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, imports, or executable statements.\n   - No input/output sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n   - No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the minimal nature of the code.\n   - They correctly identify that this code is benign, serving as a placeholder or documentation string.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1.0, reflecting certainty based on the minimal code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code contains only a docstring with no executable or malicious content, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - No justification exists for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - Confirmed as 0 across all reports.\n   - This is appropriate, as there's no malicious activity or code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly state the code's benign nature.\n   - No unwarranted claims are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a simple, non-executable package-level docstring.\n- There are no security risks, malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are correct and comprehensive. Given the code's simplicity, there is no need to adjust any scores. The code is benign, serving only as a placeholder or documentation marker.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n\n- No further action needed.\n- These assessments align with best practices for minimal, non-executable code snippets.",
