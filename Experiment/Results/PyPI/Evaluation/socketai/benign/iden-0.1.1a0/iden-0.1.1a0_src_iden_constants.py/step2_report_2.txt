  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple module defining four string constants (`ASSETS`, `KWARGS`, `LOADER`, `SHARDS`) and an `__all__` list.\n   - The import of `__future__.annotations` is standard for forward compatibility and is not suspicious.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external data sources, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is purely declarative, serving as a constants module.\n\n2. **Malicious Indicators & Anomalies**:\n   - No report mentions any anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for a constants module.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is consistent with the code content.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1 or 1.0), which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Discrepancies**:\n   - Since all reports agree on the benign nature, there are no contradictions or reasons to adjust scores.\n   - The reports correctly dismiss any security concern or malicious activity.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a straightforward constants module with no malicious or security-related issues.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are justified given the clear and simple nature of the code.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that accurately.",
