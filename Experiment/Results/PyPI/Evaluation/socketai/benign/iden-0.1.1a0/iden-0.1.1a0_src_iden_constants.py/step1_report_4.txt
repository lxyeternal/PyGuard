  "purpose": "Define and export main constants for a Python module",
  "sources": "Constant definitions: ASSETS, KWARGS, LOADER, SHARDS",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines constants",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple constant declarations and import statement",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations from __future__, defines a module-level __all__ list, and declares four string constants. There are no input handling, data processing, or external interactions. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module defining constants with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to serve as part of a larger codebase where these constants are used.",
