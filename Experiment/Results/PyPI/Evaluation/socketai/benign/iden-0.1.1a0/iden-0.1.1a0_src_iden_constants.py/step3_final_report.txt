{
  "purpose": "Define a set of string constants for use in other modules or configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only declares constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to vulnerabilities; the code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code does not process input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__.annotations for forward compatibility, defines __all__ for export control, and declares four string constants. It contains no functions, data processing, external data, or dynamic code. The code is a simple constants module, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature and assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward constants module with no malicious or security concerns. The existing scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
