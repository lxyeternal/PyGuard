  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple constants module defining four string constants and importing `__future__.annotations__`.\n- There are no functions, data processing, external input, or dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are identified.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports consistently state that the code is straightforward, static, and contains only constant definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- **No errors or logical flaws are evident.**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Not applicable here; the code is purely declarative with no potential for harm.\n\n### Malware considerations:\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n- The import of `__future__.annotations__` is standard and does not introduce risk.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All claims are based on straightforward, static code analysis.\n- No assumptions are made beyond what the code demonstrates.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the uniformity and clarity of the code and reports, I agree with the assessments. The code is benign, with **malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores all at 0**.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a simple, static constants module with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary.",
