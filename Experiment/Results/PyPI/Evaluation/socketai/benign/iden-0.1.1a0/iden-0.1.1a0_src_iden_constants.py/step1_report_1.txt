  "purpose": "Define and export main constants for use in a Python module.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources; only static assignments and imports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; all assignments are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and contains only constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations for future compatibility, defines an explicit __all__ list for module exports, and declares four string constants. There are no functions, no dynamic code execution, no external data reading, nor any behavior that could be malicious. The content is purely declarative, aimed at setting constants for a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and focused on defining constants without any malicious intent or security risks.",
