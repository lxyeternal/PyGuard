  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple constants module, with no input/output, no dynamic code, no external data, and no suspicious patterns.\n- The code imports `__future__.annotations`, defines `__all__`, and declares four string constants.\n- No functions, no data processing, no obfuscation, no secrets, and no malicious behavior are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is straightforward and contains only constant definitions. No issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and simple.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, and `securityRisk=0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely defining constants with no suspicious activity, higher scores are unjustified.\n   - The assigned scores are reasonable.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on observable code characteristics.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign constants module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is simple, straightforward, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo further action needed.",
