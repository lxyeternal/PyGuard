  "purpose": "Define and export constant string values for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and simple.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature, defines a list of exported names, and assigns string constants to variables. There are no functions, data input, or dynamic execution. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to serve as a configuration or constants module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard constants module with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not perform any operations that could be exploited or indicate tampering.",
