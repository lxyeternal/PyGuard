  "purpose": "Define and export constant string values for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "None; no input reading or data ingestion observed.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since no input or external data handling exists.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; straightforward constant definitions with no unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module defining four string constants and exporting them via __all__. It imports __future__.annotations__ but does not use it. There are no functions, input handling, or data manipulation. The code appears to be boilerplate for constants with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign constants module with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It merely defines string constants for project use.",
