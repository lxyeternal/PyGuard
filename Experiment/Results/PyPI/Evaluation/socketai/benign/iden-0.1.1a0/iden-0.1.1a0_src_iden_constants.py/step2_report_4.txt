  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple constants module, with no input/output, data processing, or dynamic behavior.\n- The code only imports a future feature, defines an `__all__` list, and declares four string constants.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- The security risk is consistently 0, which seems appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code imports `from __future__ import annotations`, which is harmless and used for forward references.\n- The `__all__` list is explicitly defined, which is good practice and not suspicious.\n- The constants are straightforward string assignments with no dynamic or external data involved.\n\n**Potential issues or points of contention:**\n- The reports uniformly assign a security risk of 0 and malware score of 0, which seems correct.\n- The scores for obfuscated code are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, simple, and clearly intended as a constants module.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The scoring appears appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the provided scores. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, benign constants module with no security risks or malicious intent.",
