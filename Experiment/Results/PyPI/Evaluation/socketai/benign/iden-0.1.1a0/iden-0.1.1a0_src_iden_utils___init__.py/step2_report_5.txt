  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports confirm that the code snippet contains only a raw string docstring describing utility functions, with no actual code, functions, data flows, or executable statements. Therefore, **no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present** in this minimal fragment.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent in noting the absence of executable code and data flows.  \n- They correctly identify that the snippet is just a placeholder or comment.  \n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.  \n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty that this is benign and non-functional code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the lack of any suspicious or malicious content.  \n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct since there's no code to obfuscate.  \n- Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the absence of any executable or suspicious elements.  \n- The confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1.0), aligning with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n- Since no code, data flows, or suspicious patterns are present, **risk scores should remain at 0**.  \n- Any higher score would be unjustified because the code is benign and non-functional.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0, as there is no malicious activity or payload in the snippet.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the snippet as a placeholder/comment.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \n- The scores are consistent with the content of the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code snippet is a benign placeholder with no security concerns.** The high confidence levels are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code fragment is purely a descriptive comment inside a raw string, with no executable code or data flow. It poses no security risk, malware threat, or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.",
