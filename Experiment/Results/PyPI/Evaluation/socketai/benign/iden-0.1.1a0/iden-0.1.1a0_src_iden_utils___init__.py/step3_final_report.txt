  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a raw string docstring describing utility functions, with no executable statements, imports, or data flows. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is effectively a placeholder or comment, posing no threat. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the content. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0) due to the simplicity and benign nature of the snippet.",
