  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports identify that the code snippet is solely a raw string docstring with no executable statements, imports, data flows, or logic. There are no signs of code execution, data handling, or suspicious activity. Therefore, **malware score = 0** in all cases, which aligns with the reports.\n\n2. **Obfuscation:**  \n   The code is straightforward, consisting only of a string comment. No obfuscation techniques are present. **Obfuscated score = 0** is appropriate.\n\n3. **Security Risk and Overall Risk Scores:**  \n   Since there is no executable code, data flow, or potential vulnerabilities, the overall security risk should be minimal. The reports assign a risk score of 0 or 0.1, which seems reasonable. Given the absence of code, I agree with these low scores.\n\n4. **Analysis of Report Logic and Reasoning:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is just a placeholder or comment with no malicious or security implications. They do not overstate the risk or suggest vulnerabilities based on assumptions.\n\n5. **Scores Consistency and Justification:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and negligible security risk. The confidence levels are high (0.9–1.0), which is justified given the simplicity of the code.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the minimal content, these scores are appropriate. If this snippet is part of a larger codebase, the actual utility functions may be elsewhere, but based solely on this fragment, there is no security concern.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No changes needed.",
