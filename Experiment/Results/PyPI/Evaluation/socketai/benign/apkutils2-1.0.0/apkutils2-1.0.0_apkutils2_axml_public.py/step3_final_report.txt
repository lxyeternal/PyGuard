{
  "purpose": "The code defines static resource mappings for Android UI attributes and styles, creating dictionaries for resource identifiers and their inverse mappings for lookup purposes.",
  "sources": "Static data embedded within the code; no external input or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; the code only initializes internal data structures without external output or data flow.",
  "flows": "The code constructs resource dictionaries and their inverses, but there are no dynamic data flows or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; all data is static and explicitly defined, with no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup of resource mappings for Android UI components, with bidirectional lookup dictionaries generated from predefined static data. No external input, network activity, or code execution occurs. The inverse mappings are standard for resource management and do not introduce security risks. The data is transparent, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static resource mapping setup, typical in Android development, with no malicious intent, security vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identified its static and safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0.",
