{
  "purpose": "The code defines resource mappings for style attributes, attributes, and system resources, including forward and inverse lookups, likely for use in an Android app or similar resource management system.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded dictionaries 'resources' and 'SYSTEM_RESOURCES' which are used to generate forward and inverse mappings for attributes and styles.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks are present; the code only creates internal mappings. There are no data flows to external systems or network communications.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the hardcoded resource dictionaries to the creation of forward and inverse mappings within the 'attributes' and 'styles' keys of 'SYSTEM_RESOURCES'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely static data initialization with no dynamic input, external data reading, or suspicious data handling. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual obfuscation are present. No indicators of malicious behavior are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code meticulously constructs bidirectional mappings for resource identifiers, attributes, and styles, using dictionary comprehensions to invert key-value pairs. It contains only static, well-structured data intended for internal resource management. There are no external data reads, network operations, or other potentially dangerous constructs. The purpose appears to be for resource referencing, likely in an Android context. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as code injection, backdoors, or privacy violations, are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static configuration module creating internal mappings for resource attributes and styles. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is benign, well-structured, and purely data-driven.",
