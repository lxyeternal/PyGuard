{
  "purpose": "Defines a structured mapping of resource identifiers for themes, styles, and attributes used in an Android UI framework, including forward and inverse mappings for attribute and style names and IDs.",
  "sources": "Resource dictionaries for 'style', 'attr', and 'SYSTEM_RESOURCES' containing mappings between names and numeric IDs.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks for untrusted data or external data flow. No network, file, or system command executions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; the code primarily creates static mappings and inverted mappings.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a full inverse mapping of attribute and style IDs to names, which might be used for dynamic resource lookups but by itself is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs resource dictionaries for styles and attributes, then creates 'SYSTEM_RESOURCES' with 'attributes' and 'styles' objects containing both forward (name-to-ID) and inverse (ID-to-name) mappings. This structure facilitates efficient resource lookups in Android development contexts. There is no evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The mappings are static, well-structured, and serve as a resource registry. No network, system modification, or privacy-violating functions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a static resource mapping setup used in Android development, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely definitional and does not perform any harmful operations or data exfiltration.",
