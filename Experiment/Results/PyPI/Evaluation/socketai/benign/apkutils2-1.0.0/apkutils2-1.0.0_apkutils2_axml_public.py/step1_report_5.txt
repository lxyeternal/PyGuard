{
  "purpose": "This code defines resource mappings for styles and attributes in an Android-like resource system, including forward and inverse mappings.",
  "sources": "Data is statically embedded within the code, originating from the resources dictionaries for styles and attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not perform data output, network communication, or dynamic code execution based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only constructs static mappings without processing external data.",
  "anomalies": "The code creates inverse mappings of resource identifiers and attributes, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. No dynamic execution, network activity, or suspicious logic identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes static dictionaries for resource IDs, including attributes and styles, and then creates forward and inverse mappings for both categories. These mappings facilitate resource lookups in either direction. The inverse mappings reverse key-value pairs from the original dictionaries. The approach is typical for resource management systems. No external data, network operations, or malicious patterns are evident. The code's structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static resource mapping setup with inverse lookups. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The only unusual aspect is the creation of inverse mappings, which is common in resource management systems but might be unnecessary in some contexts. Overall, it appears benign and intended for resource handling within an application.",
