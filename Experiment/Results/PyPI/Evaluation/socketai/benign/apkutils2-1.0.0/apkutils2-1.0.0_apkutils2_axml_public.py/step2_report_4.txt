  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential security implications, and consistency with the provided data.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes static resource mappings for Android UI attributes and styles.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external input or output; static data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly concludes there's no malicious activity, and the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores are all 0. The analysis is sound and aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, focusing on static resource definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or untrusted input; only static data transformations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Inverse mappings are created via reversing key-value pairs—standard practice in resource management.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's reasoning is accurate. The creation of inverse mappings is typical and not malicious. The scores (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines resource dictionaries with forward and inverse mappings, consistent with Android resource handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Inversion of large static dictionaries is common for lookup efficiency; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is benign.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is solid. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present, and the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static resource mappings, as per the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data involved.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Inversion of key-value pairs is standard; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a benign resource configuration.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate and consistent. The high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above—static resource mappings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or dynamic code execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The creation of inverse mappings is typical; no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign static resource setup.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is correct. The inverse mappings are common in resource systems, and there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Critical Review\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static, data-driven, and involves no external inputs or dynamic code execution.\n- **Malware & Security Risks:** None of the reports find evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The risk scores (mostly 0) are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is present; all data is explicitly defined.\n- **Inversion of Mappings:** While somewhat unusual in large static dictionaries, this is a standard practice in resource management for efficient lookups, not malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — No security risks identified; static data with no external influence.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward static resource mapping setup for Android UI attributes and styles, including bidirectional mappings. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is benign, and no changes to the scoring or reasoning are necessary.",
