      "conclusion": "Overall, the reports are consistent and cautious. The most appropriate scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0.3 in cases of suspected obfuscation, and low risk (~0.2). Slightly lowering risk scores where no concrete issues are found is reasonable. The assessments align with the evidence, and no high-confidence malicious activity is indicated."

      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for managing APK context menu entries on Windows. It involves privilege escalation and registry modifications, which pose potential security risks if misused but do not constitute malware. No malicious intent or obfuscation is present. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to system modification capabilities, but the code itself is benign."

All reports correctly identified its static and safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0."

The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate. The security risk is minimal (around 0.1-0.2), mainly related to input robustness rather than malicious intent. The code is suitable for use in analysis tools, with minor considerations for input validation."
