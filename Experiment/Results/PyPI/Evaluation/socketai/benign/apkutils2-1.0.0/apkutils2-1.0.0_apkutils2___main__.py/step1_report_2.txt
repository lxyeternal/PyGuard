{
  "purpose": "This script provides command-line interface to analyze APK files, extracting manifest, strings, files, and certificates.",
  "sources": "Input file path provided via command-line argument 'p'.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes untrusted data to external systems or performs dangerous actions; data is primarily used for display.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> APK processing methods -> Output to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution patterns. Usage of binary data decoding appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The script imports APK utility functions, processes an APK file based on user options, and displays extracted data. No network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are evident. The code primarily reads from a file specified by the user and outputs information. There are no unsafe code injections, credential handling, or suspicious behaviors observed. The only potential concern is the decoding of strings, but it is part of a feature to display APK strings. No external untrusted data source or harmful command execution detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility script for APK analysis with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
