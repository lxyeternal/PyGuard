  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'apkutils2' Python library, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads package files (though not used in setup), specifies dependencies and package info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no data leaks or external effects detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The 'read' function opens files without closing them, but this is a minor style issue, not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, straightforward setup script with no malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The dependencies are common libraries. The reports are empty, indicating no issues identified. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious actions are evident. The code does not perform any network activity or data exfiltration. The lack of detailed reports suggests no detected threats or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the code and the absence of substantive reports, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The package appears benign, with no obfuscation or malware. Scores should be set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk, reflecting a safe status.",
