  "purpose": "Static analysis of APK files to extract resources, manifest, dex files, certificates, strings, opcodes, and app icons for reverse engineering or inspection purposes.",
  "sources": "APK ZIP archive contents, including resources.arsc, AndroidManifest.xml, dex files, META-INF certificates, and other files.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external data transmission or modification of system state observed.",
  "flows": "Reading APK components from ZIP archive, parsing with external libraries, storing parsed data in class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Exception handling is broad but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static parsing and extraction of APK components using standard libraries. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. Exception handling covers errors but does not indicate malicious intent. Use of third-party libraries is typical for APK analysis. No obfuscation or backdoors are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with a benign analysis utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate APK static analysis tool with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its functionality.",
