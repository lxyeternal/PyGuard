  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign certificate parser with no malicious intent. The primary concern is the use of MD5, which is insecure but not malicious in this context. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior."
