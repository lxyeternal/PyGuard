  "purpose": "Parse PKCS7 data to extract certificates and compute their subject names and MD5 fingerprints.",
  "sources": "Reading PKCS7 data via crypto.load_pkcs7_data; accessing cert stacks via internal OpenSSL bindings; iterating over certificates with sk_X509_num and sk_X509_value; retrieving subject names and digest MD5.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not write to external systems, network, or files.",
  "flows": "Input buffer -> load_pkcs7_data -> extract cert stack -> duplicate certs -> get subject and digest -> store in content list.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal OpenSSL functions (_lib, _ffi) is unconventional but not malicious; use of MD5 for fingerprinting is insecure but common; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code loads PKCS7 data, extracts certificates, duplicates them, and retrieves subject names and MD5 hashes. No malicious code, backdoors, or network activity are present. The use of internal OpenSSL functions poses some risk but is standard in low-level bindings. The MD5 hashing is insecure for cryptographic purposes but is used here for fingerprinting, which is a common practice. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign certificate parser with no malicious intent. The primary concern is the use of MD5, which is insecure but not malicious in this context. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
