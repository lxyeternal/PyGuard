  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, but lacks specific context to determine exact purpose.",
  "sources": "Reading input from command-line arguments, environment variables, or file I/O operations.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writing output to files, printing to console, or sending data over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/env/file reads) through processing functions to sinks (outputs/network).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or suspicious obfuscated code. Some dynamic code execution constructs, if present, would be suspicious, but none are identified explicitly.",
  "analysis": "The code structure shows standard imports and function definitions with clear control flow. No embedded or obfuscated code patterns detected. No suspicious network connections, system modifications, or credential handling observed. Code appears to be a legitimate utility script with standard data handling patterns. Without specific malicious indicators, it seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit any signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It appears to be a typical Python utility script with no evident security risks.",
