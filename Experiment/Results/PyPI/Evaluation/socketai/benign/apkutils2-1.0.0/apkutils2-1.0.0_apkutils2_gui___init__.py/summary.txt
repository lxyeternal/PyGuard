  "conclusion": "Overall, the reports are consistent and cautious. The most appropriate scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0.3 in cases of suspected obfuscation, and low risk (~0.2). Slightly lowering risk scores where no concrete issues are found is reasonable. The assessments align with the evidence, and no high-confidence malicious activity is indicated."
