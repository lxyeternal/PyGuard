  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, file reads, network calls, hardcoded secrets, dynamic eval/exec, input data.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, subprocess calls, database connections, environment variables, file writes.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data to sinks like network or subprocess, possibly via dynamic execution or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation, dynamic eval/exec, hardcoded credentials, unusual code patterns, suspicious imports or code structure, but no confirmed malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The reports generally identify the presence or absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and malicious indicators. Empty code is correctly marked as low risk. Slight suspicion of obfuscation and anomalies is noted in some reports, with scores reflecting low to moderate concern. No concrete malicious activity is confirmed in any report. Scores for malware are appropriately low or zero; obfuscation scores are moderate where suspicion exists; risk scores are conservative, reflecting the potential for anomalies but no confirmed threats. Minor adjustments could be made to reflect suspicion levels more precisely, especially in reports mentioning obfuscation but lacking definitive malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the reports are consistent and cautious. The most appropriate scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0.3 in cases of suspected obfuscation, and low risk (~0.2). Slightly lowering risk scores where no concrete issues are found is reasonable. The assessments align with the evidence, and no high-confidence malicious activity is indicated.",
