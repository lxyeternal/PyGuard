  "purpose": "A comprehensive Python wrapper for the libsodium cryptographic library, exposing various cryptographic primitives such as hashing, encryption, signing, key generation, and version checks.",
  "sources": "Reads version strings from libsodium, input parameters for cryptographic functions, and random bytes generation.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include input parameters for cryptographic functions, but validation is performed; no external data transmission or insecure sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., messages, keys, nonces) flow into cryptographic functions, with validation checks ensuring proper sizes; no external network or data leaks are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are present; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured wrapper around libsodium, performing version checks, input validation, and exposing cryptographic primitives via ctypes. It does not include network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of decorators and validation aligns with best practices. No signs of malicious behavior or covert channels are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk ~0.0-0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure cryptographic wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It adheres to best practices, performs necessary validation, and does not pose security risks. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is effectively 0, indicating high confidence in its safety.",
