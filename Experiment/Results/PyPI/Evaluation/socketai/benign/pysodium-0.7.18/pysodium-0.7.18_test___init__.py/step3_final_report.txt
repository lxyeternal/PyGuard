  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "No code provided; no input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or potential data leaks identified due to absence of code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present; analysis not possible without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is missing or not provided, leading to no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code, with appropriate confidence levels reflecting limited information. Malware and obfuscation scores are set to 0, consistent with no evidence of malicious activity. Security risk scores are more accurately set to 0, given the lack of code and potential threats. The reasoning across reports is cautious and justified, with no indications of suspicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate; the security risk should be adjusted to 0 for all reports to reflect the minimal threat level. Overall, the dependency appears benign, and no further action is necessary.",
