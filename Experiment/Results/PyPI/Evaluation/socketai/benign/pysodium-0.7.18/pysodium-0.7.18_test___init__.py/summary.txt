  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate; the security risk should be adjusted to 0 for all reports to reflect the minimal threat level. Overall, the dependency appears benign, and no further action is necessary."
