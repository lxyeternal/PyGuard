  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific function within a larger application, but the exact intent cannot be determined without seeing the actual code.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include user input functions, environment variable reads, file reads, or network data reception. Since the code is not provided, specific sources cannot be identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network transmission functions, file writes, or database queries. No specific sinks are identified without code content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through function calls or data processing steps. Due to lack of code, no explicit flows can be identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are observable without the code content. Cannot determine if code is obfuscated or malicious.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient code content provided for detailed analysis. Cannot identify source, sink, or flow details. No signs of malicious or suspicious behavior detected based on available information.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of visible code, no malicious behavior or security risks can be confirmed. The code appears benign or insufficient data is available for a definitive assessment.",
