{
  "purpose": "A comprehensive test suite for the pysodium library, validating cryptographic primitives using known vectors and internal data.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded test vectors, cryptographic keys, nonces, salts, passwords, internally generated random bytes.",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic functions producing outputs for verification; no external data transmission or storage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal sources into cryptographic functions, with outputs compared against expected results or used for internal verification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard cryptographic test suite employing known vectors and internal randomness. It does not process untrusted external input, nor does it perform network or file operations outside testing. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The data flow is confined within the test environment, primarily for validation purposes. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, well-structured cryptographic test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
