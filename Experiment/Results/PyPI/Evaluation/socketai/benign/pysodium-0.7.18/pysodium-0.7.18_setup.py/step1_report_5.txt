  "purpose": "Setup script for the pysodium Python package, used to configure package metadata and installation details.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file to populate the long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script only reads a local file and calls setup().",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> Passing data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed; the code uses standard setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, defines a function to read a file, and calls setup() with package metadata. The only data reading occurs from a local README.md file, which is a common practice. There are no suspicious code behaviors, obfuscated code, or malicious actions detected. The script does not handle user input or perform network operations, and it does not contain any hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script for packaging; there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
