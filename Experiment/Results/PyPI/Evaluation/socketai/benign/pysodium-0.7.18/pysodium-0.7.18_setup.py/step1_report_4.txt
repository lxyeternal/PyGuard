  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python library called 'pysodium'.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports os and setuptools modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no user input handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "Reads a file from the filesystem to include as long description; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code is standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a utility function to read a file, then calls setup() with package metadata, including package discovery, description, and classifiers. It uses the 'read' function to include the README content. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks. The code performs typical package setup tasks without any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
