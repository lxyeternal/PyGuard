  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the pysodium Python library, reading README.md for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading the local README.md file using open()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data leaks present",
  "flows": "File read operation flows into setup() configuration; no external data flow or untrusted input involved",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports os and setuptools, defines a simple read() function to load README.md, and calls setup() with static metadata. It performs no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The code is clear, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence (1), malware score 0, obfuscation score 0, and security risk score 0. No issues or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate and justified; no modifications are necessary.",
