{
  "purpose": "The code is for configuring the setup of a Python package named 'pysodium' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads a README.md file for long_description; no external data sources or input reading beyond file I/O.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; setup configurations do not handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is from reading the README.md file into the long_description parameter during package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The read function is straightforward file reading, common in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, defines a simple file reading function, and calls setup() with static metadata. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
