  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; primarily static metadata and file reading operations.",
  "flows": "Reads static README.md file to incorporate as long_description; no flow of untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious code structures. The code appears to be standard package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, defines a simple file reading function, and calls setup() with static package metadata. It does not perform any network operations, data processing, or untrusted input handling. All operations are typical for a setup.py file. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution.",
