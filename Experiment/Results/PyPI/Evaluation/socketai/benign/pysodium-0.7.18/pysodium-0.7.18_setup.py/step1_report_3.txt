{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package called 'pysodium', used to package and distribute the library.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file from disk; reading package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions or outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A — no untrusted data sources or complex data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' without context or validation, but this is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration using setuptools. It reads a README file to include as the long description and specifies package metadata. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. No indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard package configuration tasks without involving untrusted sources or suspicious operations.",
