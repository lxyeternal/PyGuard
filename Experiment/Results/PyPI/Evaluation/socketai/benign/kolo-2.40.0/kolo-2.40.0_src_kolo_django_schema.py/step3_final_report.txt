  "purpose": "Generate and retrieve Django model schemas, including handling of fields, constraints, and relations, with caching and fallback mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Django ORM model introspection, external schema loading via load_schema_for_commit_sha, warning messages via click.echo.",
  "sinks": "click.echo for warnings; load_schema_for_commit_sha for external schema data.",
  "flows": "Model data to schema dicts, fallback to external schema load, warning message output.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Django schema introspection, handling various field types, constraints, and relations. It uses caching for efficiency and provides fallback to external schema data if available. No obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. External functions like load_schema_for_commit_sha are external dependencies but are used in a benign manner. Warnings are standard user notifications. The code's logic is straightforward and aligns with typical schema utilities. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security flaws are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Django schema utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The external schema loading and warning message do not introduce significant vulnerabilities in this context. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
