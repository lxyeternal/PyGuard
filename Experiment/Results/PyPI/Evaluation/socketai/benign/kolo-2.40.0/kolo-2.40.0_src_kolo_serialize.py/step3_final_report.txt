  "sources": "Data serialization hooks, monkeypatched QuerySet __repr__, request body decoding, response content retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Serialization output, debug logs, request/response content processing.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., datetime, QuerySet) -> serialization hooks -> msgpack encoding -> decoding hooks -> application data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected; broad exception handling in serialization functions is noted but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard debugging and serialization utilities, including monkeypatching for debugging purposes, safe data type handling, and request/response processing. No malicious payloads, external network activity, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of msgpack with custom hooks is typical for data serialization. Monkeypatching QuerySet __repr__ is a common debugging technique. Exception handling is broad but not malicious. Overall, the code appears benign and aligned with debugging and profiling tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for data serialization, debugging, and request/response handling. No malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain risks are evident. The scores are consistent with its purpose: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.",
