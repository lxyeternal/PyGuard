{
  "purpose": "Defines stub functions for pytest hooks related to logging test start and finish events.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; no external data reading or user input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no output or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows as the functions are empty stubs.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only empty functions with docstrings; no code execution, data handling, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two placeholder functions intended as hooks for pytest testing framework. Both functions are empty, serving as stubs, with no operations, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of malicious intent, code injection, or malicious behavior are observed. The use of __future__ import is standard for compatibility purposes and does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, minimal stub implementation for pytest hooks. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
