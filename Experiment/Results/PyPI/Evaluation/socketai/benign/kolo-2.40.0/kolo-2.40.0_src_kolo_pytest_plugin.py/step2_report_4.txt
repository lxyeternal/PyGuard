  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The original code consists solely of two stub functions with no implementation, only docstrings.\n   - All reports confirm that these are placeholder functions for pytest hooks, with no data processing, no side effects, and no malicious activity.\n   - There is no evidence of code that performs any harmful actions, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment: the code is benign, minimal, and serves as placeholders.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The reports correctly identify the lack of suspicious behavior, data flow, or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since the code is purely stub functions with no side effects, no data leaks, and no malicious behavior, a high risk score is unwarranted.\n   - The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - No evidence suggests malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly identify the code as harmless placeholders.\n   - No unwarranted claims are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided.\n   - The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, harmless set of stub functions for pytest hooks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the benign nature of the code. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis reflects a safe, non-malicious, and non-obfuscated utility code snippet.",
