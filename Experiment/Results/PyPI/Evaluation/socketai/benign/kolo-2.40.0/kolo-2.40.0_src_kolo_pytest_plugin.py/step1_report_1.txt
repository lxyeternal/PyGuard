  "purpose": "Stub functions for Pytest hooks related to logging test start and finish events.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; imports from future module but not used explicitly in code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output, no potential data leak points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only defines empty functions.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain only docstrings with no implementation; no suspicious or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__ annotations for future compatibility but does not use it directly. It defines two functions intended as pytest hooks for logging test start and finish, but both are stub functions with no implementation, only docstrings. There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or side effects. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is harmless, serving as placeholder or stub functions for pytest hooks. There is no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks detected.",
