{
  "purpose": "The code defines two stub functions for Pytest hooks related to test start and finish events.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external data, environment variables, or inputs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink functions or operations that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as the functions are empty stubs with no operational logic.",
  "anomalies": "The functions are empty and serve as placeholders; no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. No obfuscated code or hidden operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__ annotations for type hints, which is harmless. It defines two functions intended as Pytest hooks, but both functions contain only docstrings and no executable statements. There are no inputs, outputs, or side effects. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage are present. The code appears to be a minimal setup for test hooks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal implementation of Pytest hook stubs with no malicious intent or security issues. It serves as a placeholder for test lifecycle hooks, with no suspicious activity detected.",
