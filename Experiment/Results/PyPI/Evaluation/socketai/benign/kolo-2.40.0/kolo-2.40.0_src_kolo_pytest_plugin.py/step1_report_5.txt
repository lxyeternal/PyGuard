{
  "purpose": "The code defines stub functions for pytest test hooks, likely used to integrate with or extend pytest's testing framework.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or external output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code contains only function definitions with no execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "The functions are empty stubs with no implementation, which is normal for placeholder hooks but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code includes two function definitions that are intended as hooks for pytest's logging process during test execution. These functions do not perform any operations; they are simply placeholders with docstrings. The use of '__future__' import is for compatibility, not suspicious. There are no input sources, data leaks, or malicious behaviors observed. The code appears to be part of a testing infrastructure setup.\n\nNo malicious activity, malicious code, or security issues are evident in this snippet. It appears to be a benign, standard testing utility setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, benign setup of pytest hooks with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It functions as placeholders for potential custom logic to be added later. The code is straightforward and does not pose any security risk.",
