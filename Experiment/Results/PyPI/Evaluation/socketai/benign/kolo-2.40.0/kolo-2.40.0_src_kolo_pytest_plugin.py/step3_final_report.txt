{
  "purpose": "The code defines two stub functions for pytest hooks, serving as placeholders with no operational logic.",
  "sources": "The functions are defined but do not read input or data; no external sources are accessed.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to leaks or effects, as functions are empty.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; functions are placeholders without execution paths or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two empty functions with docstrings, serving as placeholders for pytest hooks. There is no data input, output, processing, or external communication. The import of __future__.annotations is harmless and standard for compatibility. The functions do not perform any operations, making the code benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, standard stub for pytest hooks with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify this, and the scoring aligns with the benign nature of the code. No further action or concern is necessary.",
