{
  "purpose": "The code defines two stub functions intended as hooks for pytest testing framework, likely for custom test filtering or logging.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potential data leak points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "The functions are empty and serve as placeholders; no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two function definitions with no implementation details or executable logic. Both functions are simple stubs meant for pytest hooks, which are common in test configurations. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious activities. No data manipulation, network activity, or insecure operations are present. The code appears to be benign and conventional for test setup purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a harmless stub implementation for pytest hooks with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard pattern for extending pytest behavior, with no suspicious or malicious content.",
