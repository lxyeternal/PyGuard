  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining two stub functions for pytest hooks.\n- The functions are empty, containing only docstrings.\n- The code imports `__future__.annotations` but does not use it explicitly.\n- No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are identified.\n\n**Confirming code issues:**\n- The code matches the description: two functions with only docstrings.\n- No actual logic, data flows, or side effects.\n- No evidence of code being malicious, obfuscated, or insecure.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as benign stub functions.\n- No logical errors or misconceptions are apparent.\n- The reasoning that the code is harmless and serves as placeholders is sound.\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty.\n- The scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign such scores; all are zero, which is correct.\n- If any report had assigned higher scores, I would evaluate whether the reasoning justified it, but here, they do not.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports assume the code is benign based on its minimal and placeholder nature, which is justified.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made, and none are evident.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature as benign stub functions.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, harmless set of stub functions intended for pytest hooks. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The code does not process data, read external sources, or perform any operations that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate scoring. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.",
