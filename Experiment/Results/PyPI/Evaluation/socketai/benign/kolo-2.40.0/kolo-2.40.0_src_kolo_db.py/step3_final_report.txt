  "purpose": "Management and storage of trace data, schemas, and metadata in an SQLite database with serialization support.",
  "sources": "Database read operations, data serialization/deserialization routines, schema management functions.",
  "sinks": "Database write operations, schema updates, data retrievals; no external network or file system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (traces, schemas) flows from function parameters into database insert/update queries; data retrieved via select queries and deserialized.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of parameterized queries and standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code manages trace and schema data with standard database operations, serialization, and error handling. No malicious activity, network communication, or obfuscation is present. Proper safeguards like parameterized queries are used, and error handling is appropriate. The functions perform typical CRUD and schema management tasks without suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation for trace data management with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The overall security posture is safe.",
