  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard web middleware and API endpoints with minimal security risks. The primary concern is the potential for directory traversal via unvalidated file paths in 'save_test'. No malware, sabotage, or obfuscation is detected. Scores are consistent with the code's behavior, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2 due to input validation concerns."
