  "purpose": "Utility functions to locate Node.js, execute scripts with trace data, and process output for trace analysis.",
  "sources": "System commands ('which'), environment variables, and temporary files containing trace data.",
  "sinks": "External Node.js scripts ('kolo-js.js') invoked via subprocess, reading and writing temporary files.",
  "flows": "Trace data written to temp files -> subprocess executes Node.js scripts with temp file paths -> output read and parsed (JSON or text).",
  "anomalies": "No malicious or obfuscated code; reliance on environment variables and external scripts without validation; no network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code locates Node.js executables across platforms, creates temporary files for trace data, runs external scripts via subprocess, and cleans up temp files. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. External script invocation is standard but depends on external script integrity. The code's logic is straightforward, with proper cleanup and platform support. The main security concern is environment trustworthiness, but no active malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for processing trace data with Node.js scripts. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident. The low risk score (around 0.2) is justified due to reliance on environment variables and external scripts, but these are common in such tools. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
