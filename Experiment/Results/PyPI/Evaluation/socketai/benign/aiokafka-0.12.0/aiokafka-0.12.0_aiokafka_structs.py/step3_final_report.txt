  "purpose": "Data structures modeling Kafka metadata, records, offsets, and related entities for Kafka client interactions.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions and import statements; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process or output external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static data schema definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard data class and NamedTuple definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static data structure definitions using NamedTuple and dataclass for Kafka metadata and records. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, network calls, or external data handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be part of a Kafka client library, serving as internal data schemas. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. The code's simplicity and lack of executable logic confirm its safety. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are evident or justifiable based on the code provided.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of data definitions for Kafka client interactions. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
