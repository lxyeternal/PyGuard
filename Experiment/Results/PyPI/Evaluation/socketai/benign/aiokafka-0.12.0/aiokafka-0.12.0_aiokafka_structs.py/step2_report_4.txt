  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code consists solely of data structure definitions: NamedTuple and dataclass classes modeling Kafka metadata, records, offsets, etc.\n- No dynamic code execution, external system interactions, or data processing is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code is standard for a Kafka client library, intended for internal or external use as a schema.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports uniformly state that the code is just data structures with no malicious or risky behavior. This aligns with the code provided.  \n  **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic?**  \n  The code appears correct, with appropriate use of NamedTuple and dataclass for modeling Kafka entities. No evident bugs or logical errors are apparent.  \n  **Conclusion:** No logical flaws detected.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk):**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and overall security risk as 0. This seems reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Since the code is purely data definitions with no execution or external calls, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. No malicious activity is suggested.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or code hiding techniques. A score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  The overall security risk is 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify that the code is a schema.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** Confirmed that the code is as described, with no hidden issues.\n- **Scores:** All scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n- **Risk justification:** The risk score of 0 is justified; no malicious or risky behavior detected.\n- **Malware:** 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of data definitions for Kafka client interactions. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores; the code is safe and benign.",
