{
  "purpose": "This code defines various data structures and types related to Kafka metadata, records, and offsets used for Kafka clients, particularly in a Python library for Kafka interaction.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data; it only defines classes and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present that could leak data or be exploited.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted data; the code solely declares data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior are present. The code is purely structural with standard Kafka-related data classes.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured definitions for Kafka metadata, offsets, and record data using NamedTuple and dataclass. There are no functions executing logic, no input handling, no data processing, or network operations. The usage of standard Python typing and data classes suggests intended use for Kafka client implementations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The code does not include any obfuscated, dynamic, or misleading constructs. It is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for data structure definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-malicious, standard set of data structure definitions for Kafka client operations. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. It is safe and appears to be part of an SDK or library for Kafka interactions.",
