  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code consists solely of data structures, type annotations, and class definitions related to Kafka metadata, records, and offsets.\n- No external data processing, dynamic code execution, or network interactions are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be a standard part of a Kafka client library, intended for internal or SDK use.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware and security risk scores at 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Confirmations and assessments:**\n- The code snippets do not contain any signs of malicious activity.\n- The data structures are straightforward, using standard Python features like NamedTuple and dataclasses.\n- The import of `KafkaError` from `aiokafka.errors` is appropriate and does not introduce any risk.\n- The comments and annotations are standard and do not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Scores and justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports is justified; no malicious code or behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, since the code is purely structural with no security vulnerabilities or malicious features.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable in their assessments.\n- No need to adjust scores; they accurately reflect the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's content.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of data definitions for Kafka client interactions, with no malicious or security concerns.",
