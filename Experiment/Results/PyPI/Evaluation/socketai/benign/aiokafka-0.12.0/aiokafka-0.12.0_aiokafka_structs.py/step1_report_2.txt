{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures related to Kafka metadata, consumer records, and offsets for use in a Kafka client library.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks since the code only declares data structures.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward data structure definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class and data structure definitions for Kafka-related metadata and consumer records, using standard Python features and third-party Kafka error classes. No code execution, input handling, or network operations are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code modifications. The code does not include any suspicious logic, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. Overall, this appears to be standard, well-structured data class code used in a Kafka client library.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of data structure definitions for Kafka metadata and consumer records, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign and typical part of a Kafka client implementation.",
