{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures and type annotations for Kafka client interactions, including metadata, records, and offsets.",
  "sources": "Import statements from standard libraries and third-party Kafka error module, class definitions and constants, class attributes, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code primarily defines data containers and does not process or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data structures are defined statically; no runtime data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is straightforward and primarily consists of data class definitions and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of data class and type definitions for Kafka message metadata, records, and partitions. It imports necessary modules, declares various NamedTuple classes for Kafka metadata, and a generic ConsumerRecord class. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data processing is present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code appears to be a standard part of a Kafka client library, intended for internal or external use for Kafka data modeling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-malicious, standard library code defining data structures for Kafka message handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The code is safe for use in a Kafka client context.",
