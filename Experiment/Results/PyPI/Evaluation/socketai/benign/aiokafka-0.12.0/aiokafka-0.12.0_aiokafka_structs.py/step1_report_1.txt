{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and type annotations for Kafka client interactions, including metadata, records, and offsets.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, class definitions, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows to external systems or untrusted sources; mainly static data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs. The code is primarily data class and named tuple definitions without dynamic execution or embedded code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions and type annotations for Kafka-related data, including topics, partitions, broker info, and records. It uses standard Python constructs without any suspicious logic, external calls, or data handling that could lead to security risks. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code appears to be part of a Kafka client library, intended for internal use or as part of an SDK. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or unsafe patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of data structures used for Kafka client interactions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a schema or API definition without executing any risky operations.",
