{
  "purpose": "Define data structures and types for Kafka-related metadata, records, and offsets used in a Kafka client library.",
  "sources": "Import statements and class definitions that initialize types and data models.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; code is primarily data structure definitions with no data output or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Data structures are used to pass Kafka metadata and records within the application; no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is primarily type annotations and data containers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple NamedTuple and dataclass structures to model Kafka metadata, records, and offsets. It imports standard and external libraries without executing any logic or external calls. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. There are no signs of obfuscated code, unusual variable use, or hidden backdoors. The code is straightforward data modeling for Kafka client functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data model implementation for Kafka metadata and record handling, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and normal for its purpose.",
