{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for Kafka consumer rebalance handling and OAuth token provisioning, intended for use in Kafka client applications.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code defines class interfaces and methods.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leak points; no untrusted data output.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only defines abstract classes with method signatures; no concrete data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code strictly defines interfaces without implementation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two abstract base classes for Kafka consumer callbacks and OAuth token provisioning, including detailed docstrings explaining their purpose and usage. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The methods are abstract or simple return statements, with no embedded logic that could be malicious. The code's structure and content are consistent with standard practice for defining interface classes in Python. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or hidden backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign definition of interface classes for Kafka consumer rebalance listeners and OAuth token providers. It contains no malicious intent, no malicious code, and no security risks. It appears to be safe and intended for legitimate use in Kafka client implementations.",
