{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract classes for Kafka consumer rebalance listener and OAuth token provider, used for managing consumer group rebalancing and authentication.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data sources; primarily defines abstract interfaces.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data leaks present. The code does not handle untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; these are interface definitions without executable logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is well-structured, with standard use of abc for abstract classes, and includes detailed docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two abstract classes: ConsumerRebalanceListener and AbstractTokenProvider, intended for Kafka consumer management and OAuth token handling respectively. Both classes define abstract methods for user implementation. No executable logic, external data handling, or suspicious operations are present. The code strictly defines interfaces and documentation, with no indication of malicious intent or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely interface definitions for Kafka consumer rebalancing and OAuth token provisioning, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, well-documented, and safe for use. No malicious or malicious-sounding code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
