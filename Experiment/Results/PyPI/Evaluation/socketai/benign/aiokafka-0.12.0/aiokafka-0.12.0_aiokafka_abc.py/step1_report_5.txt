  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for Kafka consumer rebalance listeners and SASL OAuth token providers.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, method definitions, and imported modules (abc).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, input, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as this code only defines interfaces.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides abstract base classes with method signatures for handling consumer rebalancing and OAuth token provision. It does not contain executable logic, data processing, or data transmission. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or backdoors are present. The structure is typical for defining interfaces in Python. No signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured definition of interfaces for Kafka consumer rebalance handling and OAuth token management. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code is safe and intended for interface specification only.",
