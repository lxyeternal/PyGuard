{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract classes for Kafka consumer rebalance listeners and SASL OAuthBearer token providers, intended for use in custom implementations.",
  "sources": "Class and method definitions, docstrings, and imports. No external or untrusted input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or untrusted data processing identified; the code primarily provides interface definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code is structural and declarative, setting up expected methods and behaviors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of abstract class definitions with detailed docstrings explaining their intended use. It does not include any executable logic or data handling that could be malicious. There are no signs of embedded malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The design is standard for Kafka client interfaces, and the code appears to serve as a framework for user-implemented classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-documented set of abstract interfaces for Kafka consumer rebalancing and OAuth token provision. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code. It is safe and non-malicious, serving as a foundation for user-specific implementations.",
