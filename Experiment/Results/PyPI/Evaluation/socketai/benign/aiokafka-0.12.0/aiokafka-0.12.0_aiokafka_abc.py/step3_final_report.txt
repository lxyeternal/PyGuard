{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract classes for Kafka consumer rebalance listener and OAuth token provider, serving as interfaces for user implementation.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; class methods are placeholders for user-defined logic.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing present in the interface definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely structural class definitions without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, embedded secrets, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of abstract base classes with detailed docstrings, serving as extension points for user-defined behavior. There are no embedded secrets, network calls, or executable logic that could be malicious. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and standard for defining interfaces in Python. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of interface definitions for Kafka rebalance handling and OAuth token provisioning. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The assigned malware score of 0, security risk score of 0, and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
