  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines abstract classes for Kafka rebalance listener and OAuth token provider.\n- Source/Sinks: No external input handling or data leaks.\n- Flows: No data flow; purely interface.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: Strictly interface definitions with detailed docstrings; no executable logic or embedded secrets.\n- Conclusion: Safe, legitimate, no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk score: 0 (appropriate, no security concern)\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar abstract classes for Kafka consumer rebalance and OAuth token provider.\n- Source/Sinks: No untrusted data handling.\n- Flows: No data flow; structural code.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: Standard interface definitions, no embedded secrets or suspicious code.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent, safe.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk score: 0 (appropriate)\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Abstract classes for rebalance callbacks and token provisioning.\n- Source/Sinks: No explicit data leaks; user-implemented methods handle data.\n- Flows: User implementations could process sensitive data, but the base code is safe.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Only interface definitions, no executable logic or secrets.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Similar interface classes.\n- Source/Sinks: No external data handling.\n- Flows: No data flow.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard interface classes, no secrets or malicious code.\n- Conclusion: Safe, legitimate.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Defines abstract classes for Kafka rebalance and OAuth token.\n- Source/Sinks: No data leaks.\n- Flows: No data flow.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical interface definitions, no embedded secrets or malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard interfaces.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is purely interface definitions with no executable logic, no embedded secrets, and no malicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is consistent with the content.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low (0), given the absence of executable code or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall:** The code is a set of standard, well-documented abstract classes for Kafka consumer rebalancing and OAuth token provisioning. It is safe, non-malicious, and suitable for open-source use.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified based on the code content.",
