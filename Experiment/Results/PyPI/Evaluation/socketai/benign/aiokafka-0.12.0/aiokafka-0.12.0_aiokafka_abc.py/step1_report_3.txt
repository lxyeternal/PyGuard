{
  "purpose": "The code defines abstract base classes for Kafka consumer rebalancing callbacks and OAuth token provisioning, facilitating custom handling of partition reassignments and token management.",
  "sources": "User-defined implementations of the abstract methods: on_partitions_revoked, on_partitions_assigned, and token.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if custom implementations mishandle sensitive information such as tokens or offsets; however, no explicit sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "User implementations of the abstract methods can receive partition data or tokens and process them, but the base classes do not contain any flow logic themselves.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code strictly defines abstract interfaces with no executable logic or embedded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code only provides abstract base classes for Kafka consumer rebalance listeners and OAuth token providers. It contains method signatures with documentation, but no executable logic, data handling, or embedded secrets. No code injection, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. The functions are meant for user implementation. There is no indication of obfuscation or malware behavior. The design appears standard and intended for extensibility. The lack of actual implementation or embedded secrets reduces risk. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward definition of abstract classes for Kafka consumer rebalancing and OAuth token provisioning. It contains no executable code or secrets, and it appears safe. No malicious intent or malicious code is detected.",
