  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Defines abstract classes for Kafka rebalance listener and OAuth token provider. No executable logic, data handling, or external input processing.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** The report assigns a risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature as interface definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies the code as safe, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar to Report 1—abstract classes for Kafka rebalance and OAuth token provider, with no embedded secrets or malicious patterns.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Risk score of 0 aligns with the code being purely interface definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Same as above—interface classes with detailed docstrings, no executable logic.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Interface definitions, no data handling or embedded secrets.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Zero risk score fits the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Same as previous—interface classes with no executable code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No issues.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Zero risk score is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely interface definitions for Kafka consumer rebalancing and OAuth token provisioning.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are set to 0, which is appropriate given the absence of executable logic, secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- **Consistency:** The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the detailed reasoning in each report.\n\n---\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — interface definitions pose no security risk.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough, accurate, and consistent. The code is safe, standard, and intended for extension by user implementations. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the code is benign and well-understood as a set of interface definitions for Kafka client extensions.",
