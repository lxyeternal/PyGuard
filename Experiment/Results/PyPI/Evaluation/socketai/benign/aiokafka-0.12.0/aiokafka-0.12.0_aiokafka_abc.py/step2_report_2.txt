  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, code content, and scoring rationale.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines abstract classes for Kafka rebalance listener and OAuth token provider.\n- Content: Pure interface definitions, no executable logic, no data handling.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely interface definitions with no malicious behavior. The malware and security risk scores are appropriately set to 0. The high confidence is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar abstract class definitions for Kafka rebalance and OAuth token provider.\n- Content: No external input handling, no embedded secrets, no suspicious patterns.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code is standard interface code with no malicious content. The slightly lower confidence (0.9) might be due to cautiousness, but given the code, this is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, for Kafka rebalance and OAuth token classes.\n- Content: Only abstract classes with documentation, no implementation or secrets.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly states that there is no executable logic or secrets, and no malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Defines interface classes for Kafka consumer and OAuth.\n- Content: No external data, no embedded secrets, no suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar interface class definitions.\n- Content: No data handling, no secrets, no malicious patterns.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion is accurate; the code is standard interface definitions with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely interface definitions with no executable logic, no embedded secrets, and no malicious behavior.\n- Malware scores are appropriately set to 0 across all reports.\n- Security risk scores are also correctly 0.\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- Given the analysis, I agree with the scores assigned.\n- The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and serves as a framework for user implementation.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe set of interface definitions with no security concerns.",
