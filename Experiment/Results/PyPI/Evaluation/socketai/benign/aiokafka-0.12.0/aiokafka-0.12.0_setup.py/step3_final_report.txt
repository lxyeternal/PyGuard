  "purpose": "Build configuration script for Cython extensions with platform-specific flags and error handling to allow build failures without crashing.",
  "sources": "Platform detection via platform.uname().system, source files (.pyx, .c), build extension classes, RPM spec modification.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, no network activity, no malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Configuration and build process flow, with error handling to suppress build errors, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except blocks to suppress build errors, which could hide genuine build issues but is a common practice; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard build setup for Cython extensions, with platform-specific flags and error suppression to improve robustness. No suspicious data flows, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The suppression of build errors could hide issues but does not indicate malicious intent. Scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate; security risk scores around 0.1-0.2 are justified due to error suppression but are not indicative of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard build configuration with platform-specific adjustments and error handling. No evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, and the malware/obfuscated scores are correct.",
