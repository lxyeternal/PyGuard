  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of an asyncio-based Kafka client connection. It does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. The only operational security concern relates to transmitting credentials in plaintext during SASL PLAIN or OAuth, which should be protected with TLS in deployment. The assigned scores accurately reflect these considerations, and no adjustments are necessary."
