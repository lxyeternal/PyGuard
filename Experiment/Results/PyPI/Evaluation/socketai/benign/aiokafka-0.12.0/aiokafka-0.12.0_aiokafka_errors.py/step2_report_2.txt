  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code defines error classes, mappings, and utility functions. No data input, network calls, or external data processing are present.\n- **Logical flaws:** None detected. The report correctly states the code's purpose and benign nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.9 — seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or backdoors. The report's assessment is accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on error class hierarchy and safe error code mapping.\n- **Logical flaws:** None. The analysis is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.0 — appropriate, considering the code is purely structural.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as non-malicious.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; no external data handling or malicious logic.\n- **Logical flaws:** None. The detailed analysis confirms the code's benign nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 — accurate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No external data or suspicious behavior.\n- **Logical flaws:** No issues. The analysis aligns with the code's purpose.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 — suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Logical flaws:** None. The analysis is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of exception classes and utility functions for Kafka error handling.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable, with the highest risk score being 0.9, which is acceptable given the context.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily because this is a static error handling module, which generally poses no security risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign error handling module for Kafka clients. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
