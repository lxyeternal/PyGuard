  "purpose": "Defines Kafka error classes, error code mappings, and utility functions for error handling within Kafka client implementations.",
  "sources": "Static class definitions, error code attributes, and the for_code function accessing the kafka_errors mapping.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network calls, or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "Error code to class mapping via kafka_errors dictionary, used in for_code function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets or external data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of exception classes representing Kafka errors, with attributes indicating whether errors are retriable or affect metadata. It includes a utility to map error codes to error classes, built dynamically from subclasses. The code is purely static, with no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The structure is straightforward and intended solely for error classification and handling in Kafka client contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign error handling module for Kafka, with no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is well-structured, static, and free from obfuscation or external data processing. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
