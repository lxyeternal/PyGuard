{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions representing Kafka errors for use in a Python Kafka client library.",
  "sources": "The code defines classes and functions for error handling; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute code; the code is purely defining error classes and lookup functions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code only sets up exception classes and a mapping of error codes to classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code is standard for error handling structures.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a set of exception classes for Kafka-related errors, with some subclasses indicating retriable or metadata-invalid errors. It also creates a dictionary mapping error codes to error classes, and a function to retrieve error classes based on code. No external data input, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The structure is straightforward and aligns with typical error handling patterns in client libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom error classes and an error code lookup for Kafka errors. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be a benign component intended for error management within a Kafka client library.",
