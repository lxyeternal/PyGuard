{
  "purpose": "Define and organize custom exception classes for Kafka error handling, including error codes, descriptions, and behaviors.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, and data structures that instantiate and organize error classes and mappings.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or input handling is involved in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code primarily defines static classes and a lookup function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No unusual behaviors or obfuscation detected. The code is purely structural, defining exceptions and error mappings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines numerous custom exception classes representing Kafka errors, and creates a mapping for error code lookups. All classes inherit from base exception classes without executing any suspicious logic or external interactions. The purpose is to facilitate error handling within Kafka client implementations. No inputs are processed, no data leaks, no system calls, or network operations are present. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured set of error class definitions and mappings for Kafka error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, no malicious payloads, or supply chain security threats. It appears to be a standard, open-source error handling module with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
