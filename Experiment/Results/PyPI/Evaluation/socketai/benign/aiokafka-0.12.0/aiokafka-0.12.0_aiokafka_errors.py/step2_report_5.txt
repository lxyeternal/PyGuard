  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, code structure, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward error class hierarchy for Kafka errors, with no malicious behavior. It notes the absence of external data handling, obfuscation, or network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.9 (considering the high confidence that this is benign).\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is purely structural with no malicious intent. It highlights the dynamic creation of error class mappings, which is safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.0 (full confidence in benign nature).\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that the code defines exception classes and mappings without external data processing or malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Notes that the code is standard for error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—error class definitions with safe, static mappings, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify that there's no malicious code present. The code solely defines error classes and a safe lookup function.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—error handling classes with no external interactions or data processing—the risk is minimal. The high confidence scores (mostly 1.0) are justified.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports. Clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk:** Given the absence of external data handling, network calls, or code execution, the overall security risk remains very low—likely 0.0 to 0.1.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured set of error classes for Kafka, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reported scores are reasonable and align with the code's purpose.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly because it's a static error handling module with no external dependencies or data flow)",
