{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for Kafka-related errors, error codes, and utility functions for error handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from collections.abc and typing modules; error class definitions; error code mapping functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, no external data handling or network connections present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly sets up error classes and mapping functions without external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code appears to be a straightforward error handling module with extensive error class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom error classes for Kafka errors, with attributes indicating retriability and metadata invalidation. It includes error code mappings and utility functions to retrieve error classes by code. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic, are present. The code is well-structured, with clear purpose related to error handling. No anomalies indicating malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of Kafka error classes and utility functions for error handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It serves as part of a larger Kafka client library for managing errors safely.",
