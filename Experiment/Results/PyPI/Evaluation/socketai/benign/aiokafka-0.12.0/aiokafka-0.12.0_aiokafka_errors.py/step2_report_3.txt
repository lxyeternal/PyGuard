  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines Kafka error classes and utility functions.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external data processing or network interactions.\n- Anomalies: No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: The code is purely class definitions and mappings, with no suspicious logic.\n- Conclusion: Benign, standard error handling code.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining error classes and mappings.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data processing.\n- Anomalies: No malicious behaviors or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: The dynamic subclass collection and error code mapping are safe.\n- Conclusion: Standard, benign error handling module.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (very low, just a minimal concern)\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as non-malicious, with appropriate reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Error class definitions for Kafka.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Static class definitions, no data processing.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious activity.\n- Analysis: Straightforward error hierarchy and mapping.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is a standard error handling setup.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Kafka error classes and error code mapping.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external input or malicious logic.\n- Anomalies: No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Safe static class definitions and lookup.\n- Conclusion: Benign, standard implementation.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Defines Kafka error classes and mapping.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external data or command execution.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious behavior.\n- Analysis: Properly structured, safe static classes.\n- Conclusion: Non-malicious, standard error definitions.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious intent or behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence:** The code is purely class definitions and utility functions for error handling.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** Essentially zero, as the code does not perform any external or risky operations.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are appropriately zero; risk scores are minimal.\n\n### Final Justification:\nGiven the nature of the code—defining error classes, mappings, and utility functions—it is a standard component of a Kafka client library, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. The code is static, well-structured, and free from obfuscation or external data processing.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
