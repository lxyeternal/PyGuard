{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions for Kafka errors, error codes, and related error handling utilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements for collections.abc and typing modules, error class definitions, and the error code mapping functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input data or execute data-dependent operations that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The error code mapping function 'for_code' retrieves exception classes based on error codes, but does not execute untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be a structured error handling module. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various custom exceptions for Kafka-related errors, assigning properties such as 'retriable' and 'invalid_metadata'. It creates a comprehensive error class hierarchy, supporting detailed error reporting. The '_iter_subclasses' function dynamically collects all subclasses of 'BrokerResponseError' for building a mapping 'kafka_errors'. The 'for_code' function provides a safe lookup for error classes based on error codes. There are no input or output operations, network communications, or file manipulations. The code strictly focuses on error classification and mapping, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured error handling module for Kafka client implementations. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. All logic appears benign and intended for error management within a Kafka client library.",
