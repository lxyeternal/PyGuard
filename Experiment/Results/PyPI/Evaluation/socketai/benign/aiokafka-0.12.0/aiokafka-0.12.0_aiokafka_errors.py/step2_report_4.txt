  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes that the code defines a hierarchy of Kafka error classes, with no data flow or external interactions. It correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward error handling module.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code contains no malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscated parts. The high confidence (0.9) aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are appropriately set to 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the static nature of the error classes and the safe mapping function `for_code`. It notes the absence of untrusted data processing or external operations.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is purely structural, defining exceptions and a safe lookup.\n\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns; the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, highlights the static class definitions and the mapping utility. No suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns are detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code content. The code is standard for error handling.\n\n- **Scores:** Both 0, matching the benign assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard nature of the error class hierarchy and the safe mapping function. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is typical for client libraries handling protocol errors.\n\n- **Scores:** Both 0, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns; the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes the code as a comprehensive set of exception classes for Kafka errors, with safe error code to class mapping, and no dynamic or external code execution.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is correct. The code is static, well-structured, and free of malicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores:** Both 0, fitting the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the report is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports correctly identify that this code is a standard, well-structured error handling module for Kafka, with no malicious intent, backdoors, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence levels and zero malware/obfuscated scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to the nature of error handling code, but no actual security risk)\n\nThis code is a benign, essential part of a Kafka client library, serving error classification and handling purposes without any security concerns.",
