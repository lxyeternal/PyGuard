{
  "purpose": "Manages Kafka cluster metadata, updating internal state based on API responses and configuration.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters, API response data (brokers, topics, partitions, group info).",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures, listener callbacks, future objects signaling update completion.",
  "flows": "Reads from API responses and configs; updates internal dictionaries and sets; not directly executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Kafka client component for managing cluster metadata, with proper locking, error handling, and data encapsulation. No signs of obfuscation, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The logic is clear, and the data flow is confined within the process. No dynamic code execution or external data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Kafka cluster metadata handler with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It performs expected functions without suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.15, reflecting minimal inherent risk.",
