  "purpose": "Utility functions for asyncio task management, version parsing, offset validation, and environment configuration in an async Kafka client.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, environment variables, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; primarily internal validation and asyncio operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and environment variables through validation functions and asyncio task/future creation routines.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; standard validation and asyncio usage.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for asyncio and Kafka version/offset validation, with proper exception handling and validation routines. It reads environment variables safely for configuration flags. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious patterns are present. Use of get_event_loop() with a check for is_running() is appropriate. Version parsing enforces bounds, and offset validation ensures correct data structures. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for an asyncio Kafka client, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
