  "purpose": "Utility functions for asyncio-based Kafka client operations, including task creation, version parsing, and offset validation.",
  "sources": "os.environ for environment variable; get_running_loop() for retrieving the current asyncio event loop.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly involve untrusted data flows that could lead to data leaks or code execution; functions mainly perform validation and task management.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check -> create_task/create_future -> wait_for -> parse_kafka_version -> commit_structure_validate -> get_running_loop",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Code appears to be standard async utility functions. Use of environment variable for configuration is common.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions for asyncio task and future creation, including a custom wait_for to handle a specific Python bug. It includes version parsing with validation, and a structure validation for Kafka offsets. The environment variable is used for configuration. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The functions are standard and align with typical asynchronous programming practices. No anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility code for managing Kafka client operations in an asyncio environment. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks beyond standard programming practices. No indicators of malware or security issues are present.",
