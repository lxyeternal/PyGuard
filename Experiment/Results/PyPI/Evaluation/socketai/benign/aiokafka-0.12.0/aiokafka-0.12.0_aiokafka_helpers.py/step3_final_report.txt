  "purpose": "A helper function to create an SSLContext with configurable CA certificates, client certificates, and private keys, primarily for secure SSL/TLS connections.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as cafile, capath, cadata, certfile, keyfile, and password, which are used to load certificates and keys into the SSL context.",
  "sinks": "The load_cert_chain and create_default_context functions, which establish trust and load credentials based on provided inputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence the creation of the SSL context and loading of certificates; data flows from parameters into SSL context setup functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Logging only reports filenames and data sources, not secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SSL context setup utility using standard Python SSL library functions. It handles certificate files and optional passwords securely, with appropriate logging. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The risk primarily depends on external trustworthiness of input files, which is typical in SSL configurations. The code does not perform any network activity or data exfiltration. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SSL context helper with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The inherent risks are typical for SSL setup, related to trust in external certificate files, but no specific vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and justified.",
