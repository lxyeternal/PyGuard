{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer (__init__.py) for a Python Kafka client library, importing core classes, errors, and data structures, and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules, no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A – static import statements without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup, importing classes and defining __all__ for API exposure. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify it as benign with no malicious or security concerns. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign __init__.py module for a Python Kafka client library. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious behavior, and is free of obfuscation. The scores and assessments across all reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
