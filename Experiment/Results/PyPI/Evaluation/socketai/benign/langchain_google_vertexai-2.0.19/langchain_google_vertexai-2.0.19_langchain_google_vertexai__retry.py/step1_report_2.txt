{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to create a retry decorator for handling specific error types, primarily related to API calls, with customizable retry parameters and callback management.",
  "sources": "Reads include imported modules, function arguments, and exception handling within the retry logic.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is used in a harmful manner; code mainly manages retries and logging.",
  "flows": "Inputs (error types, retry parameters) influence retry logic; callback management can trigger callback functions during retries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a retry decorator with configurable error types and wait parameters, handling Google API errors with specific logic to exclude InvalidArgument from retries. It incorporates callback management for retry events, including asynchronous callback invocation. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present; the logic appears focused on robust error handling and retry mechanisms without external malicious influences.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of a retry decorator for API calls with error handling and callback support. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It is a legitimate utility function for error handling in API interaction contexts.",
