  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code creates a retry decorator for handling specific exceptions, with callback management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes that callback updates and logging are the main sinks, with flow controlled by error types.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, standard retry pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes the code is standard, legitimate, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0, security risk 0.1 (low).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard error handling, callback invocation, and retry logic.\n- No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- Confidence is even higher (1.0), malware score 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the utility nature of the code, standard patterns, and safe callback handling.\n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Confidence 1.0, malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Highlights correct async/sync handling, callback updates, and standard retry logic.\n- No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, proper asyncio use.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), malware 0, security risk 0.2 (still low).\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Reiterates the standard nature, no untrusted data processing, no obfuscation.\n- Clear that the code is a typical retry utility.\n- Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a standard retry utility with callback management, no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Error Handling & Logic:** The code's logic for handling Google API errors, especially excluding `InvalidArgument` from retries, is explicit and correct.\n- **Potential Risks:** The only minor concern is the use of callback managers (`run_manager`) which could, in theory, be malicious if controlled by an attacker, but this is a standard pattern and not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. Security risks are very low, consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n### My Final Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, readable, and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 — very low, given the callback management could be misused if run_manager is malicious, but this is a typical pattern.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\nThe code is a well-structured, standard implementation of a retry decorator with callback support, error handling, and exponential backoff. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The minor security risk score reflects the potential misuse of callback managers if they are maliciously controlled, but this is a common pattern in such utility code.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware score at **0**.\n- Obfuscated score at **0**.\n- Security risk score at **0.1–0.2**, depending on trust in the callback managers.\n\nThis analysis confirms the code is safe and legitimate, with no malicious or obfuscated components.",
