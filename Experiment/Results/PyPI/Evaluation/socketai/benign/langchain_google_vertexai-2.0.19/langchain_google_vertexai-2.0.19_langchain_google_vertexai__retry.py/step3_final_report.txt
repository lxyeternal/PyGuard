{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to create a retry decorator that handles specific exception types, particularly Google API errors, with exponential backoff and callback management, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous callback managers.",
  "sources": "Error types specified in 'error_types', callback manager 'run_manager', and wait parameters in 'wait_exponential_kwargs'.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, callback manager updates during retries, and exception handling flows.",
  "flows": "Error detection in try-except blocks triggers retries; callback updates and logging occur before sleep; error types determine retry conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious control flows detected. Callback management is standard, and no external network activity or data exfiltration is present.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a retry decorator with configurable error types, special handling for Google API errors (excluding InvalidArgument), and supports both sync and async callback managers. It uses tenacity for exponential backoff, logs retry attempts, and updates callback managers with retry state info. No malicious or obfuscated code is present; the logic is straightforward and aligns with best practices for error handling and retries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured retry utility with callback support, error handling, and exponential backoff. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident. The low security risk score reflects the standard pattern and minimal threat, with potential concern only if 'run_manager' is maliciously controlled, which is outside static analysis scope.",
