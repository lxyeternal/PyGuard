{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to create a retry decorator for handling specific exceptions during API calls or operations, with callback management and exponential backoff.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are external error types passed as arguments; the code also reads the run_manager state and exception outcomes during retries.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink could be logging outputs and the callback manager's on_retry method, which may handle retry info or state updates.",
  "flows": "Error types trigger retries; the retry logic uses error handling to determine whether to retry or not, and callback manager updates occur during the before_sleep phase.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious control flows are present. The code utilizes standard retry patterns and logging. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a configurable retry mechanism with exponential backoff for specific error types, particularly targeting Google API errors, with special handling for InvalidArgument exceptions. It manages callback updates during retries, updating either a synchronous or asynchronous callback manager. The code appears to follow best practices for retry logic, error handling, and callback notifications. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations are present. The code's purpose aligns with standard retry patterns in API interaction scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a retry decorator with callback updates and exponential backoff. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate utility code for robust API error handling.",
