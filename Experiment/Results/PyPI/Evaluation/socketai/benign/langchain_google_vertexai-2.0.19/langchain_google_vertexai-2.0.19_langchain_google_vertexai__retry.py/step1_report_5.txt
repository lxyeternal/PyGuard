{
  "purpose": "The code defines a utility function to create a retry decorator for handling specific exceptions during API calls, with detailed logging and callback management.",
  "sources": "None explicitly read input data or untrusted sources; the code imports modules and defines functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data for leakage or effects.",
  "flows": "The function creates a retry decorator that manages retries and logs or updates callback managers during exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present. The callback management and exception handling follow standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a retry decorator using tenacity, with integration for callback managers. It handles specific exceptions, logs retry attempts, and updates callback managers accordingly. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. The logic is transparent, with no hidden or obfuscated code, and it does not perform any unauthorized actions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical retry utility function designed for robustness in API interactions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
