  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to evaluate the correctness, potential issues, and risk scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements a retry decorator with callback management, exponential backoff, and specific handling for Google API errors, notably excluding `InvalidArgument` from retries.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious control flows. The code uses standard retry patterns, logging, and callback updates.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score is justified; the code is a typical utility for error handling. The confidence level (0.9) aligns with the thoroughness of the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on a retry decorator with configurable error types and wait parameters, with specific handling for Google API errors.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard patterns. Callback management and error handling are straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is sound; the code is standard, and the risk score is appropriately low.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility function for retries with logging and callback support, handling Google API errors with specific logic.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. Callback updates are standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies the code as standard and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Retry decorator with callback management, error handling, and exponential backoff, supporting async and sync contexts.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, correct use of asyncio and retries.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) possibly due to async handling, but still justified as the code is standard.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard retry utility with logging and callback management, no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data processing, no obfuscation, straightforward patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero, as no malicious behaviors or payloads are present.\n- **Security risk scores:** All are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent with the analysis)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code—standard retry logic with callback management—the risk score should remain very low, around 0.1 to 0.2, as currently assigned.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a typical, well-structured retry utility with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to callback complexity but still minimal)\n\nThis aligns with the current evaluations and the detailed review.",
