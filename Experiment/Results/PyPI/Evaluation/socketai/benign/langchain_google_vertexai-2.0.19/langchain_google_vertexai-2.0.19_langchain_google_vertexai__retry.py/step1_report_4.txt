{
  "purpose": "The code defines a utility function to create a retry decorator for handling specific error types in asynchronous and synchronous contexts, with callback management and exponential backoff.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters, error types, callback managers, and logging functions.",
  "sinks": "The code updates metadata in callback managers and logs retry attempts; no data is written to external sources or files.",
  "flows": "Input error types and retry parameters flow into retry configuration; retry logic and callback invocations are triggered upon errors during function execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present. Use of asyncio event loop is standard for async operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for asynchronous operations, logging, and retries. It creates a retry decorator with customizable error types and wait parameters, incorporating callback management for both synchronous and asynchronous callback managers. The function handles retries for Google API errors specifically, with custom handling for the InvalidArgument error. Callback functions update retry metadata, and the code manages asyncio event loops correctly. No malicious behaviors such as network transmission of system data, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The logic appears consistent and intended for robust error handling in API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured utility for implementing retries with exponential backoff and callback updates. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware signatures. There are no signs of obfuscation or harmful code. The overall security risk is low.",
