  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the provided evaluations.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nThe code defines a function to create a retry decorator that handles specific exception types, especially targeting Google API errors, with exponential backoff and callback management. The implementation includes logging, handling both sync and async callback managers, and avoids retries on certain errors like InvalidArgument. The reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Analysis:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are apparent in the code. It follows common patterns for retries, error handling, and callback invocation.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected. The code manages retries and logs or updates callback managers without performing any suspicious actions.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation or hidden code is present.\n- **Error handling:** Properly distinguishes between error types, especially for Google API errors, with specific logic to avoid retrying on `InvalidArgument`.\n- **Callback management:** Supports both synchronous and asynchronous callback managers, invoking `on_retry` appropriately.\n- **Logging:** Uses standard logging practices for retry attempts.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low security risk. This seems reasonable given the code's purpose.\n- **Confidence levels:** High (0.9 to 1), indicating the reviewers are confident in their assessments.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The code's logic is straightforward, implementing a configurable retry decorator with callback support.\n- The special handling of Google API errors, especially excluding `InvalidArgument` from retries, is a common pattern.\n- Callback invocation during retries is standard, with proper handling for async and sync contexts.\n- No signs of obfuscation, data exfiltration, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the provided reports' conclusions. The code is a legitimate utility for robust API error handling, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior.\n\n**My own estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, due to retry logic and callback management, but inherently safe)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, well-implemented retry utility with no security concerns.**",
