  "purpose": "Utility module for loading images from Google Cloud Storage, base64 strings, URLs, and (deprecated) local files, providing image bytes, model parts, and message content parts.",
  "sources": "Network requests (requests.get), Google Cloud Storage URIs, base64 data URIs, URL parsing, file existence checks.",
  "sinks": "Returns image bytes, creates Part objects, encodes images to base64, constructs message parts.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (GCS URI, base64 string, URL) routed through _route() to respective handlers, data fetched or decoded, then returned or wrapped in Part objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, removal of local file support explicitly documented, no suspicious network activity or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured utility for image data handling, with validation and error handling. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The removal of local file support is a security measure. Network requests are typical for such utilities; no insecure configurations are evident. The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, security-conscious utility module for image loading and message part creation. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) is justified by external data handling but does not indicate malicious intent.",
