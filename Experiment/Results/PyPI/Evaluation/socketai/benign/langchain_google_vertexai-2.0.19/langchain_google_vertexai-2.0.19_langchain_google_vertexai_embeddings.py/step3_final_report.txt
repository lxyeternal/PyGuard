  "purpose": "A Python SDK wrapper for Google Cloud VertexAI embeddings, managing batching, retries, and supporting text/image embedding functionalities.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input texts, image paths, API calls to Google Cloud services",
  "sinks": "API requests over network, data returned as embeddings, threading and retry mechanisms",
  "flows": "Input data flows from user inputs or environment variables through batching and retry logic to API calls, with embeddings returned as output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; deprecation warnings are benign",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured SDK wrapper utilizing threading, batching, and retries for interacting with Google Cloud VertexAI. It handles environment validation, supports text and image embeddings, and manages batch sizes dynamically. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The use of environment variables and network calls is standard for such SDKs. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident. The retry logic and threading are implemented appropriately, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented SDK wrapper for Google Cloud VertexAI embeddings. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The low security risk score reflects typical external API interactions and environment reliance, with no inherent vulnerabilities.",
