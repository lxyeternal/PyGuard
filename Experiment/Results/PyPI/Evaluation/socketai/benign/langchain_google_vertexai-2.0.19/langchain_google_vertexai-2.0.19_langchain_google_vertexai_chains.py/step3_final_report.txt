  "purpose": "Utility functions for creating structured prompt chains, schemas, and parsers for AI workflows, primarily for entity recording and function call management.",
  "sources": "Schema extraction via schema() and model_json_schema(), attribute checks, prompt templates, and function bindings.",
  "sinks": "Internal data flow within chain objects; no external data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from parameters through prompt templates and function bindings to chain execution and output parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard library calls, attribute checks, and API usage for schema handling and chain construction. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The functions are designed for safe, structured interactions with language models, with optional extra parsing steps. No external network calls or data leaks are present. The code's purpose aligns with AI prompt engineering, and no suspicious signals are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility for AI prompt and function schema management. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal potential for misuse but no active threats.",
