  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential security implications, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides utility functions for creating structured runnables for language models, focusing on safe schema and prompt management. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The low security risk score reflects minimal concern, which is appropriate given the code's nature. The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious behavior is present.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe construction of language model chains with function schemas and prompts. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2) is acceptable, considering the potential for misusing function calls if inputs are untrusted, but overall, the code is safe. Malware remains at 0, which is correct.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code constructs function-call-enabled language model chains with schema extraction and binding. No suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The securityRisk score remains low, reflecting standard usage. Malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for structured prompt chains with function schemas and prompts. No malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The low securityRisk score aligns with the benign nature of the code. Malware remains at 0, justified.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Functions for creating structured runnables, with schema handling and prompt chaining. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The absence of security concerns is correctly reflected in the scores. Malware remains at 0.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variations (0.1 or 0.2) are reasonable, considering the code's potential if misused, but no actual vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to the potential for misuse if inputs are untrusted, but no actual security flaws.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent with the code's nature. The scoring appropriately reflects the benign, utility-focused purpose of the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
