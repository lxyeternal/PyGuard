{
  "purpose": "The code provides a structured SDK interface for Google Cloud Vertex AI, managing client setup, request configuration, and response parsing for AI model interactions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, function parameters, input prompts, and configuration fields within the code.",
  "sinks": "Network calls to Google Cloud API endpoints, data parsing from responses, and credential handling.",
  "flows": "Input prompts and configuration parameters flow into client initialization and request preparation, then into network calls, with responses parsed into structured outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Uses standard SDK patterns and safe practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of Google Cloud Vertex AI SDK components, including client initialization, validation, request setup, and response parsing. It manages credentials and endpoints securely, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic. The network interactions are with official Google domains, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The structure and flow are typical for SDKs, with appropriate validation and configuration. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscation to 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2), reflecting the inherent network interactions but no vulnerabilities or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK component for Google Cloud Vertex AI, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
