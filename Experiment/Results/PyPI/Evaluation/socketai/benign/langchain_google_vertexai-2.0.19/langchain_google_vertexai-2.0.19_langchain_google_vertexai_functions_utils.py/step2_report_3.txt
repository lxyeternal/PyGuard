  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is utility functions for schema formatting, tool declaration, and output parsing. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected. Warnings for unsupported schema features are standard.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the detailed analysis. No malware detected.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with the assessment.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's reasoning appears sound. The code is utility-focused, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing schema transformation, tool configuration, and parsing. Notes potential data leaks via schema handling but no actual malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — still very low, consistent with the description.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is consistent. No malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on schema conversion, tool declaration, and output parsing. Highlights standard practices, warnings for unsupported features, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware indicated.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — minimal, consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusions are justified. No security threats detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing schema and tool management, no malicious behavior, standard schema handling, warnings are benign.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the detailed reasoning.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, consistent.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Verdict:** The assessment appears accurate. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code performs schema and tool conversions, output parsing, with no malicious activity. Warnings for unsupported features are standard.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware indicated.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — very low, consistent.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports identify actual issues or malicious code. They all recognize the code as utility functions for schema/tool management, with standard warnings and no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** The reports are consistent, detailed, and cautious, correctly assigning a malware score of 0 and very low security risk.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** All scores are reasonable. The malware scores are 0 across the board, which is justified given the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Potential for Higher Risk:** No reason exists to assign a higher risk score; the code appears safe and well-contained.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear, utility functions, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — minimal, primarily due to schema warnings, which are benign.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is a set of schema and tool conversion utilities, with no malicious or security-threatening features. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, standard for its purpose, and poses no security threat. The detailed reasoning in all reports aligns with my analysis.",
