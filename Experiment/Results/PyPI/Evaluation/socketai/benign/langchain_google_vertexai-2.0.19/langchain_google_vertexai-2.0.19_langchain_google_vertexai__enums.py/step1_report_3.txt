{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes from the 'vertexai.generative_models' package and defines an explicit export list.",
  "sources": "Import statement from external package 'vertexai.generative_models'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only imports and declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three classes: HarmBlockThreshold, HarmCategory, and SafetySetting from a third-party package. It then defines the __all__ list to specify what is exported when the module is imported elsewhere. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks within this snippet. It appears to be a straightforward module setup for a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import and export declaration with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
