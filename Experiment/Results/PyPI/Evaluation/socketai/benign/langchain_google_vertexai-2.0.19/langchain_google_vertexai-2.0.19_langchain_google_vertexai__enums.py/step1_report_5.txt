{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and export certain classes related to safety and harm categories from the 'vertexai' library, likely for configuring or managing AI safety settings.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'vertexai.generative_models' module",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "N/A; code only imports and defines export list",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward and standard for module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from an external module and defines an __all__ list for export, indicating intended public API exposure. No data input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs are present. The use of 'type: ignore' suggests handling of type checking issues, which is common and not suspicious. Overall, the code is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module import and export setup for safety-related classes from a well-known AI library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
