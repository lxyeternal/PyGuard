  "purpose": "Define exportable identifiers for models related to safety and harm categories within the vertexai.generative_models package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from an external library 'vertexai.generative_models'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data affects execution or leaks; the code only performs import and exports.",
  "flows": "Import from external module to local namespace; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from an external package, likely for use elsewhere in the project. It then declares these as exportable via __all__. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python modules. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious data handling. The imported classes pertain to safety and harm categorization, which are likely domain-specific models, not malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard import and export declaration for safety-related classes from an external library. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
