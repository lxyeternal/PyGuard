  "purpose": "Import specific classes from the vertexai.generative_models module for use in other parts of a project.",
  "sources": "Import statement from vertexai.generative_models module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only performs static imports without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; the code appears to be standard import syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three classes (HarmBlockThreshold, HarmCategory, SafetySetting) from a module related to vertex AI generative models. It then defines __all__ for module exports. There is no indication of hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior. No external data processing or network activity occurs. The code is straightforward, intended for module exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement for necessary classes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
