  "purpose": "Import specific classes from the vertexai.generative_models library and define __all__ for module exports.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from an external library; no untrusted input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows present; no untrusted data processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "None; the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a definition of __all__, indicating a straightforward module setup. No dynamic code execution, data processing, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, with high confidence. The lack of data flows, sinks, or anomalies supports the conclusion that the code is non-malicious. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk near 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
