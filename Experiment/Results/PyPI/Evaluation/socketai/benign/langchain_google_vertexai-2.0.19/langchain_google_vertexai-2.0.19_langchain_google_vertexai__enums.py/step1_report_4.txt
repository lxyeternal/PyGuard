{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define public API exports for a module related to generative models, specifically for harm blocking thresholds, categories, and safety settings.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the 'vertexai.generative_models' package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and defines exports without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export statements, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from an external package and then defines __all__ for module exports. It lacks data processing, input handling, or suspicious behavior. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The import suggests dependence on an external library related to generative AI safety features, which appears legitimate. There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign module that exports certain classes from an external library for use elsewhere. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected based on this snippet.",
