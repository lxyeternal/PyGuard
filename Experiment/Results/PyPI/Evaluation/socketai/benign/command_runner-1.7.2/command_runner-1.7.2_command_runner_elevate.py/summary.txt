  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate privilege escalation utility that uses standard methods for elevating process privileges. It does not contain malware or malicious sabotage. The main security concern is potential misuse if environment or input validation is compromised, but this is typical for such tools. Scores are consistent with the analysis."
