  "purpose": "Setup script for the command_runner package, used for package metadata and installation configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading files: __init__.py, requirements.txt, README.md; accessing environment variables; package metadata extraction.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks identified; no data is transmitted externally or executed unsafely.",
  "flows": "Reads package files → extracts metadata and requirements → passes data to setuptools.setup for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard setup tasks; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated or suspicious code. No external network access or system modifications are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads files for package metadata, requirements, and description, then configures the package installation via setuptools. The code includes compatibility for Python 2 and 3, uses standard libraries, and adheres to typical setup patterns. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic are detected. The functions and flow are straightforward, with no suspicious code paths, hidden behaviors, or external calls beyond package setup. The presence of package metadata and requirements parsing aligns with typical packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected functions for package distribution and configuration without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
