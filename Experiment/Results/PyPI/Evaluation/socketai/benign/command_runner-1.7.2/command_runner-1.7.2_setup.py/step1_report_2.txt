{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration file for the command_runner Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata from __init__.py, reading requirements from requirements.txt, reading README.md for long description, environment variables for paths, and package file system for package content.",
  "sinks": "Calling setuptools.setup with package information and dependencies; no direct sink of untrusted data; no execution of external code or commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading files (__init__.py, requirements.txt, README.md) into variables used for package setup; no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flows. The code performs standard package setup tasks without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup operations: reading metadata, dependencies, and description files; configuring package installation parameters; and invoking setuptools.setup. There are no indications of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. It does not execute any external commands, handle untrusted input beyond reading files, or contain obfuscated code. All operations are consistent with standard Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It reads package metadata and dependencies to prepare for installation without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
