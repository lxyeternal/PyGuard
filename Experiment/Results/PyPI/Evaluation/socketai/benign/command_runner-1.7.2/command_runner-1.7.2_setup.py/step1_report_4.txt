{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'command_runner' by reading metadata, requirements, and description files, then configuring installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading files (__init__.py, requirements.txt, README.md), package metadata extraction, and setup configuration via setuptools.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or executes untrusted input; no apparent sinks for malicious data or commands.",
  "flows": "The code reads metadata and requirements files to gather package info; no flow of untrusted data to execute commands or alter system state.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.version_info for Python version check; fallback for missing files with default return; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated parts; standard package setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package metadata and setup configuration, including reading files and defining requirements. It contains no dynamic code execution, command injection, or network activity. The use of read_file functions includes compatibility handling between Python 2 and 3, which is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be legitimate setup code for a Python package with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard setup script for a Python package and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It reads package metadata, requirements, and description files for package installation. No malware or security issues are detected.",
