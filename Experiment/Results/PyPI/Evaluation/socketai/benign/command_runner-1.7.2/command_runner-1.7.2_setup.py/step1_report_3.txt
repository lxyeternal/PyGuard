{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package named 'command_runner' by reading metadata, requirements, and description files, and configuring the package installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads files: __init__.py for metadata, requirements.txt for dependencies, README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no code executes untrusted data, no network connections, no external command execution, no environment variable misuse, no hardcoded credentials.",
  "flows": "Reads package files (metadata, requirements, README), then passes data to setuptools.setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code follows standard setup procedures with no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations: reading metadata from a __init__.py file, parsing requirements, and configuring setuptools. It handles compatibility with Python 2 and 3. The only potentially risky parts are file reading operations, but these are typical and not malicious. No dynamic execution, network operations, or data exfiltration are present. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and focused solely on package configuration.",
