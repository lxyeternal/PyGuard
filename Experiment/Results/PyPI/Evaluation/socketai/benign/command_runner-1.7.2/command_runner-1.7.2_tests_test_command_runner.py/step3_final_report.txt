{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for the 'command_runner' module, executing various system commands, handling outputs, and verifying behavior across platforms and scenarios.",
  "sources": "Commands like ping, cat, type, powershell, environment variables, and file reads.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution, output streams, environment variables, and file operations.",
  "flows": "Input commands are processed through command_runner, with outputs captured via callbacks, streams, or files; no external network or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic detected. Commands are standard and used within controlled tests.",
  "analysis": "The code performs controlled testing of command execution, output handling, error scenarios, and platform-specific behaviors. It uses standard commands and patterns, with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The environment variables and command inputs are typical for testing purposes. No external network activity or data exfiltration is observed. The scores reflect the benign nature: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, justified by the controlled execution of system commands in a testing context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
