  "purpose": "This code provides utilities to parse and manage '# noqa' comments in Python source files, supporting static analysis tools like flake8.",
  "sources": "Regex pattern matching on token strings to identify file-scoped and inline '# noqa' comments.",
  "sinks": "None; data flows are limited to pattern matching and in-memory comment storage.",
  "flows": "Token string input → regex matching → comment object creation and storage.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; regex patterns are straightforward, and classes serve simple data encapsulation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns to detect '# noqa' comments, classes to match and store these comments, and methods to retrieve and manage them. It operates solely on static comment data, with no code execution, network activity, or external effects. The logic is simple, transparent, and focused on comment parsing for static analysis purposes. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for parsing and managing '# noqa' comments. It contains no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0—are appropriate and consistent with its functionality.",
