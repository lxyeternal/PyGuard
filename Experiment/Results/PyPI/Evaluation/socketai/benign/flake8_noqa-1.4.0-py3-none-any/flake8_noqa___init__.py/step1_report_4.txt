  "purpose": "This code defines a simple plugin for flake8 that checks for malformed noqa comments.",
  "sources": "No input sources for untrusted data; only defines static variables and comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data; no potential leak points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only sets string variables.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no complex behavior; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code sets plugin prefixes and comment filters for a flake8 plugin. It does not execute external code, handle input, or perform network operations. It appears to be a straightforward plugin setup with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, intended to support a static code analysis tool. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks are evident.",
