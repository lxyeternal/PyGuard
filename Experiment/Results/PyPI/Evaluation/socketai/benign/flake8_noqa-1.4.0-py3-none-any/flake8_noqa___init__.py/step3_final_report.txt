  "purpose": "Define string constants for plugin prefixes used in a flake8 plugin to check for malformed noqa comments.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments within the code; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static constants without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward constant definitions with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static setup defining string constants for plugin prefixes. It involves no external input, no dynamic execution, and no network activity. The purpose is to set identifiers for a plugin, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All scores across reports are zero, aligning with the benign nature. No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The code's simplicity and clarity confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static configuration with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
