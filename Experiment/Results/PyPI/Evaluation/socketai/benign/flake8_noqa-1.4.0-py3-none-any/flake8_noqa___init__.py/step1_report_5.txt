{
  "purpose": "Defines prefixes for a flake8 plugin that checks for malformed noqa comments.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data collection sources; only variable definitions and a comment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points; no handling of untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows; code is only variable assignments and a comment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward variable definitions and a descriptive comment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a descriptive comment about a flake8 plugin. It defines a plugin prefix and constructs two other prefixes by concatenation. There are no inputs, external calls, or data handling. The code appears to be part of a larger plugin implementation but, in isolation, does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears benign, serving only to define constants for a plugin. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
