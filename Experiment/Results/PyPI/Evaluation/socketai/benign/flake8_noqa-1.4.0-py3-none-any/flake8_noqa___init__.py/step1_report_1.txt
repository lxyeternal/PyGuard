{
  "purpose": "This code defines a plugin for flake8 to check for malformed noqa comments.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code is static and defines variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up string constants for plugin prefixes, likely used in a flake8 plugin to identify and process noqa comments. It is static, simple, and does not include any dynamic execution, external input handling, or suspicious code segments. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, straightforward setup for a flake8 plugin component. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and poses no security risks.",
