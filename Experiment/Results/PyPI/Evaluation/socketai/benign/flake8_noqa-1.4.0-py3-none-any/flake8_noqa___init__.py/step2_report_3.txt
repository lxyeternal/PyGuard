  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a static snippet defining string constants (`plugin_prefix`, `noqa_checker_prefix`, `noqa_filter_prefix`) for a flake8 plugin.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no input/output, external dependencies, or dynamic execution.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no malware, no external data handling, and no security risks.\n   - Given the code's simplicity, the likelihood of malicious intent is extremely low.\n   - No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscation, are identified.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification:**\n   - The `malware` score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The `securityRisk` score is also 0, which seems appropriate.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - The `confidence` is 1, indicating high certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Overestimations:**\n   - No claims or assumptions are made about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior that need challenging.\n   - The code's purpose is clear and limited to defining constants for a plugin, with no hidden or malicious logic.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code appears entirely benign.\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are reasonable and justified.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Remain at 0.\n\nThis code snippet is a safe, minimal configuration fragment with no security concerns.",
