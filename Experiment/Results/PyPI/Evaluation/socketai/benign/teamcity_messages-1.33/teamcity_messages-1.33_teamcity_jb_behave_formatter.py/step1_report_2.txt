{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom formatter for the Behave testing framework to report test execution results to TeamCity CI server.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as datetime, traceback, collections, and external behave and teamcity.message libraries. Uses feature, scenario, step objects, and teamcity service message functions.",
  "sinks": "Calls to teamcity.message functions with test and suite names, error messages, and test durations; these are standard reporting mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Data flows from feature/scenario/step objects through formatter methods, triggering teamcity messages. No untrusted input sources or data processing beyond standard test reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. The code mainly manages test reporting flow and relies on imported libraries for messaging.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for reporting test progress to TeamCity, with methods to handle features, scenarios, steps, and results. It asserts object types, manages internal state, and sends messages accordingly. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious commands are present. External library usage appears standard for such a formatter. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic execution is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a test report formatter for TeamCity. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. It is a normal part of a CI pipeline setup with no security concerns.",
