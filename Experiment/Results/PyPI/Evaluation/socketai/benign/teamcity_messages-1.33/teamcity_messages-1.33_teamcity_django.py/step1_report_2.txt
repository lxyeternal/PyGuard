  "purpose": "Custom Django test runner integrating TeamCity continuous integration.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, django.test.runner, and teamcity.unittestpy modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; only calls to external test runner.",
  "flows": "The run_suite method calls TeamcityTestRunner().run(suite), which delegates testing to an external library.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Django's DiscoverRunner to override the run_suite method, which uses TeamCity's test runner to execute tests. All imports are from standard or third-party libraries intended for CI/CD integration. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious code behaviors are evident. The code serves a legitimate purpose in test automation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate customization for integrating Django tests with TeamCity CI server. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks in this fragment.",
