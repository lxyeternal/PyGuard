  "purpose": "Custom test runner integration for Django using TeamCity CI server.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, django.test.runner, and teamcity.unittestpy modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only defines a class with a method override.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class extension and method override with no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules to extend Django's test runner with TeamCity support. It defines a subclass overriding run_suite to use TeamcityTestRunner for executing test suites. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behavior, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code simply acts as a bridge to integrate testing with CI.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical integration snippet for running Django tests with TeamCity. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
