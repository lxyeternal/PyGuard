  "purpose": "Custom Django test runner integration with TeamCity CI system",
  "sources": "Imports from django.test.runner and teamcity.unittestpy modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only invokes existing library methods",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; simply overrides a method to call a third-party test runner",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward override of test runner method",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Django's DiscoverRunner to replace its run_suite method with one that uses TeamCity's test runner. There are no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior indicators. It relies on existing, well-known libraries for testing purposes. No input data is read from external sources; no untrusted data flows are evident. The code appears to be intended solely for CI integration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard override to facilitate test reporting in TeamCity CI; no malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
