  "purpose": "A minimal subclass of Django's DiscoverRunner that overrides run_suite to delegate test execution to TeamcityTestRunner.",
  "sources": "Import statements for __future__, django.test.runner, and teamcity.unittestpy; class definition; method override.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "The run_suite method calls TeamcityTestRunner().run(suite), delegating execution without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard imports and a simple method override.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple subclass overriding run_suite to delegate to TeamcityTestRunner. It involves no data processing, input handling, or dynamic code execution. The imports are from known libraries, and the class serves as a CI/CD integration point. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present. The scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless extension for CI/CD purposes with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score reflecting its benign role.",
