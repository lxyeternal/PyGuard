  "purpose": "Custom Django test runner integrating TeamCity testing platform",
  "sources": "Import statements for __future__, django.test.runner, and teamcity.unittestpy modules",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Django's DiscoverRunner to override the run_suite method, delegating test execution to TeamCity's test runner. The imports are standard and relevant for test integration. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious data handling, or malicious behavior. The code solely modifies test execution flow for reporting purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward customization of Django's test runner for TeamCity integration without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
