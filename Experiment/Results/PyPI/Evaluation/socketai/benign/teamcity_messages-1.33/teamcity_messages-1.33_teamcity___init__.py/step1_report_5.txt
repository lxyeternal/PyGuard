  "purpose": "Detect if the current environment is running under TeamCity CI server",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'TEAMCITY_VERSION' read via os.getenv",
  "sinks": "Return value of is_running_under_teamcity() function (boolean)",
  "flows": "os.getenv reads 'TEAMCITY_VERSION' -> bool() converts to boolean -> function returns result",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors observed; standard environment check",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to check for the presence of an environment variable indicating TeamCity CI environment. It uses standard library functions with no obfuscation or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, no data exfiltration, or suspicious code patterns are present. The environment variable check is straightforward and typical for CI detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple environment check function with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign utility to detect TeamCity CI environment.",
