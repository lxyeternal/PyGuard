{
  "purpose": "Check if the current environment is running under TeamCity CI server",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'TEAMCITY_VERSION' accessed via os.getenv",
  "sinks": "The environment variable value is retrieved but not used in a way that leads to data leakage or security impact",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'TEAMCITY_VERSION' is read and returned as a boolean indicator",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple environment check, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports os to access environment variables and defines a function to determine if it's running under TeamCity CI by checking 'TEAMCITY_VERSION'. The function returns a boolean based on whether the variable is set. No input manipulation, no external data flow beyond environment variable access, and no suspicious logic or malicious patterns. The code appears to be a straightforward environment check utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign environment detection check with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
