  "purpose": "Determine if the code is running under the TeamCity CI environment.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'TEAMCITY_VERSION' accessed via os.getenv.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of environment variable could influence conditional logic or configuration, but no direct sink like file writing or network is present.",
  "flows": "The environment variable is read and converted to a boolean, affecting program flow based on CI environment detection.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and standard for environment detection.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that checks for the presence of a specific environment variable 'TEAMCITY_VERSION'. If it exists, the function returns True, indicating execution under TeamCity. It uses standard Python functions without any suspicious or malicious constructs. There are no external data inputs, no data leaks, or network operations. No signs of malware or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple environment detection snippet intended for CI pipeline identification. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
