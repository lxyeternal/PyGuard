  "purpose": "Determine if the current environment is TeamCity CI server by checking an environment variable.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'TEAMCITY_VERSION' accessed via os.getenv.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or security effects; environment variable read only.",
  "flows": "Environment variable is read and converted to boolean; no data flow beyond the environment check.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, straightforward, no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic. No obfuscation or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines a function to check if 'TEAMCITY_VERSION' environment variable exists, indicating running under TeamCity CI. It uses environment variables safely, with no input/output vulnerabilities, no external network or file operations. The logic is simple and legitimate for environment detection.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a legitimate environment detection task with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard implementation for environment checks in CI/CD pipelines.",
