  "purpose": "Detects if the code is running under TeamCity CI environment by checking for the 'TEAMCITY_VERSION' environment variable.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'TEAMCITY_VERSION' via os.getenv()",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only reads an environment variable and returns a boolean",
  "flows": "Source: os.getenv('TEAMCITY_VERSION') -> Return boolean indicating presence",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward environment variable check, no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, simple, and performs a standard environment detection task. It reads an environment variable and returns a boolean. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The logic is correct and aligns with typical CI environment detection patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. Scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward environment variable check with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the current scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
