{
  "purpose": "Define various context managers for messaging and flow control in a testing or compilation framework.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data comes from parameters passed to functions or message objects.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data into system effects or leaks; primarily calls to message object methods.",
  "flows": "Parameters such as 'messages' and 'name' pass data between source and sink within context managers.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious variable use.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'contextlib2' or falls back to 'contextlib', defines multiple context managers that invoke message methods for logging or flow control. No user input processing, no network activity, no data leaks, and no system modifications. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The functions serve as wrappers for messaging actions in testing or compilation processes, which are typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of context managers for messaging in a build or test framework. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
