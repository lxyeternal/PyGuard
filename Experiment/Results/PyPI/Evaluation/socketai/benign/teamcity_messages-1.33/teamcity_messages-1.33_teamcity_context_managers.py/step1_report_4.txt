{
  "purpose": "Define context managers for messaging and control flow handling in an application, such as block management, compilation, testing, and progress reporting.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'contextlib2' or 'contextlib'; function parameters used as inputs for messaging functions.",
  "sinks": "Calls to messaging object methods such as blockOpened, blockClosed, compilationStarted, compilationFinished, testSuiteStarted, testSuiteFinished, testStarted, testFinished, progressStart, progressFinish, disableServiceMessages, enableServiceMessages.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (messages object, message names, flow IDs) are passed into context managers; these parameters are used to invoke messaging methods before and after yield, controlling messaging state and flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. Usage of try-except for import is standard for fallback and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several context managers to handle messaging and control flow events, such as starting and stopping blocks, compilation, tests, progress indicators, and toggling messaging states. It imports messaging functions conditionally, with fallback for compatibility. There are no indications of malicious actions, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The code structure is straightforward and focused on logging or state management without external data manipulation or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a utility for managing messaging states via context managers. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The implementation is clean, purpose-driven, and does not include suspicious behaviors.",
