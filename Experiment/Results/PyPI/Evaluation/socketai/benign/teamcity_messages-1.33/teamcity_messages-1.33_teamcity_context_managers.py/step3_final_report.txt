{
  "purpose": "Define context managers for signaling process states and messaging events within a build or test framework.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to each context manager and the 'messages' object methods invoked within them.",
  "sinks": "Methods on the 'messages' object that log or signal process events; no data sinks or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into 'messages' method calls; no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward context managers that invoke messaging functions to signal process stages. It imports 'contextlib2' with fallback, uses 'messages' for signaling, and contains no external data handling, network activity, or system modifications. The code is clear, well-structured, and serves as a utility for process flow management. No security vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for signaling process states with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly assess its safety, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
