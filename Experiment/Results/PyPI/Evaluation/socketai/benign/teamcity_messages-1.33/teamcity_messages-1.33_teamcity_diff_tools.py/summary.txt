  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing utility module with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The external store_exception call is used for debugging purposes and does not pose a security threat. The code's clarity and lack of suspicious patterns justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1)."
