  "purpose": "Utility functions for patching unittest assertions, custom assertion error class, and environment-based formatting",
  "sources": "Imports modules os, pprint, sys, unittest, and messages from local package",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or external network interactions",
  "flows": "No external input-to-output data flows; mainly internal logic and exception handling",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable '_JB_PPRINT_PRIMITIVES' to control pprint behavior; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for patching unittest methods and a custom assertion error class for comparing expected and actual values. It includes environment-based formatting controls, compatibility handling for Python 2 and 3, and a deserialization method for errors. There are no suspicious network operations, file manipulations, or external data leaks. The code appears to serve testing and debugging purposes with standard practices and no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module designed for testing purposes with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
