  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for patching unittest assertions, custom assertion error class, and environment-based formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (_JB_PPRINT_PRIMITIVES), calls store_exception for exception storage.",
  "sinks": "store_exception function acts as a sink for exception data, potentially external but used for debugging.",
  "flows": "Code flows from assertion patching to exception storage, with data formatting influenced by environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of store_exception external to core logic; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code patches unittest's assertEqual, defines a custom exception class for assertion errors, and formats data based on environment variables. It also stores exceptions via store_exception, likely for debugging. No network, file, or malicious system modifications are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The exception storage and environment variable influence are typical in testing utilities and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing utility module with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The external store_exception call is used for debugging purposes and does not pose a security threat. The code's clarity and lack of suspicious patterns justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1).",
