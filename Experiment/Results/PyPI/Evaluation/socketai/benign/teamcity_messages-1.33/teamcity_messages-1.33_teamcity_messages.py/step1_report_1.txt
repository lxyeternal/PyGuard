{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and classes to send structured TeamCity build and test messages, handle encoding, retries, and output management.",
  "sources": "Input sources include sys.stdout, sys.stderr, output buffer, and system time functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are written to sys.stdout or output.buffer; messages are formatted and written as strings or encoded bytes.",
  "flows": "Input from system outputs or environment, processed and formatted, then written to outputs; no untrusted data flows to external systems or networks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or unusual code constructs; use of standard libraries and pattern consistent with telemetry/reporting functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles message formatting, encoding, output management, and retry mechanisms. It includes functions for encoding/decoding, safe retries on IO errors, and a class encapsulating various TeamCity message types. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. It leverages standard Python features, with attention to encoding and compatibility across Python versions. No network connections, external data leaks, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing TeamCity messages and logging, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It functions as intended for telemetry and build reporting without any malicious side-effects.",
