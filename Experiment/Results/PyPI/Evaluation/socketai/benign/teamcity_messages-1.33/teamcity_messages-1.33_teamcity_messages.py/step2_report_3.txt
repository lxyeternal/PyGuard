  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions and classes for TeamCity messaging, handling encoding, retries, output management. No suspicious behavior, standard use of libraries, no malicious intent.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code matches the description—functions for encoding, message formatting, retries, and output management. No signs of malicious code.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified. The reasoning about the absence of malicious behavior is sound.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0. Reasonable.\n\n- **Justification for scores:** The low risk and malware scores are justified; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility for sending structured TeamCity messages, potential for untrusted data to be written to output streams, but no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code handles message construction, encoding, and output. The flow of untrusted data into output streams is typical for logging systems.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** No significant flaws or logical errors. The concern about untrusted data is valid but standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0. Reasonable.\n\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, just standard message output. The slightly higher risk score accounts for potential data injection, but overall low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility class for emitting TeamCity messages, encoding, message formatting, no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code matches the description, with functions for message formatting, encoding, output management.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues detected. The handling of untrusted data is standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0. Reasonable.\n\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, just message formatting.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions and class for TeamCity messages, encoding, retry logic, no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code matches, with standard functions and error handling.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues. The retry logic and encoding are standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0. Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Class for interfacing with TeamCity, standard message formatting, no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code aligns with the description—methods for reporting build/test info, output management.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious code or behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0. Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code or behavior. The code is purely for logging and message formatting.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), justified by the fact that the code handles untrusted input (message properties, test outputs) that are written to output streams. However, these are standard for such utilities and do not pose a significant security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — clear, readable code.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.2** — minimal, standard logging/output handling, no external network activity or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate utility for CI/CD message reporting to TeamCity, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
