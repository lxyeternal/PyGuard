  "purpose": "Utility classes and functions for emitting structured TeamCity build/test messages, handling encoding, retries, and output streams.",
  "sources": "Reads input from parameters (message properties, test info), system time, environment variables, and output streams (sys.stdout or buffer).",
  "sinks": "Writes formatted messages to output streams, potentially from untrusted sources if message properties are externally influenced.",
  "flows": "External input (parameters, environment) flows into message formatting functions, encoded, then written to output streams with retries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. Uses standard libraries and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for emitting TeamCity messages, managing encoding, retries, and output streams. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The use of encoding and retry decorators is standard practice. External data passed into message properties could be manipulated but does not constitute malicious behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are observed. The code's purpose aligns with CI/CD reporting, and the implementation appears secure and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for CI/CD systems with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
