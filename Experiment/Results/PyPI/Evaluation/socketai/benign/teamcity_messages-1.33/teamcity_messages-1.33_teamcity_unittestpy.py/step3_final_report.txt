{
  "purpose": "This code implements a custom unittest TestResult and TestRunner for reporting test progress, failures, skips, and subtests to TeamCity via structured service messages, capturing stdout/stderr during tests.",
  "sources": "Reads test objects, error data, and environment info; accesses external modules for messaging and exception handling.",
  "sinks": "Outputs structured messages to stdout/stderr and TeamCity, potentially exposing untrusted error data if external modules are compromised.",
  "flows": "Test execution triggers start, success, failure, skip, error, and subtest reporting; captures stdout/stderr; reports via TeamCity messages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. External modules like get_exception() are used for exception retrieval, not code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation for CI test reporting. It manages test lifecycle events, output capturing, and messaging without any signs of malicious activity. External dependencies are typical for CI integrations but should be verified for trustworthiness. No obfuscation, network activity, or data exfiltration is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate test reporting utility for TeamCity with no malicious intent or behavior. External modules and functions are used for standard purposes. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 due to external dependencies, which are common in such tools.",
