  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and standard for SWIG-generated bindings. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 to 0.1, with high confidence. The high security risk score in Report 5 is unjustified and should be adjusted downward."
