{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a wrapper for C/C++ modules generated by SWIG, enabling Python interface for ITK image processing libraries.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as itk.ITKPyBasePython, itk.ITKStatisticsPython, itk.ITKImageGridPython, itk.ITKConnectedComponentsPython, and specific ITK filters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks handling untrusted data, external network communication, or file manipulation are present.",
  "flows": "The code loads external modules and sets up class attribute handling, with no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. The code is boilerplate wrapper generated by SWIG, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard SWIG-generated wrapper for C++ modules. It imports several ITK modules and defines helper functions for class attribute management. There are no network operations, file I/O, or data handling that could be exploited. The code's structure and comments indicate it's auto-generated for interface purposes, not for executing malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a boilerplate interface wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious flows. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use within ITK Python bindings.",
