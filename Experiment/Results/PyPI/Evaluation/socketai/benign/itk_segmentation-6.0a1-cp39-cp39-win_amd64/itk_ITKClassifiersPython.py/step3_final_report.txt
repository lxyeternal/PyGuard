{
  "purpose": "Auto-generated SWIG interface code for ITK C++ modules, facilitating Python bindings.",
  "sources": "Module imports, class attribute setters, and decorators within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; primarily module imports and class setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated SWIG wrapper for ITK modules, with functions for attribute management and module imports. It contains no network activity, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The structure is straightforward, and the purpose is solely to facilitate Python bindings. All reports correctly identify it as benign boilerplate code. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score is effectively 0 or very close, with a minor conservative elevation to 0.1 in one report which is unwarranted given the benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as an interface layer, and poses no security threat. The scores assigned are accurate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
