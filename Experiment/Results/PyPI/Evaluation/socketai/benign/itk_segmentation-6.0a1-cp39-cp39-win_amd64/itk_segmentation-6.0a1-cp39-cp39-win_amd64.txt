      "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and standard for SWIG-generated bindings. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 to 0.1, with high confidence. The high security risk score in Report 5 is unjustified and should be adjusted downward."

      "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, benign, and typical for open-source SWIG bindings of ITK segmentation filters. There are no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The primary risk relates to untrusted input handling, which is standard in such interfaces but should be validated externally. Overall, the security posture is very low, with no indicators of malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely boilerplate for bindings, and poses no security risks or malicious threats. All reports correctly identify it as auto-generated, safe, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and should be maintained."
