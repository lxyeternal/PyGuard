  "purpose": "Auto-generated SWIG bindings for ITK binary median image filters, enabling Python access to C++ classes for image processing.",
  "sources": "Instantiation via factory methods (e.g., New()), configuration through setters, and execution via __internal_call__().",
  "sinks": "The __internal_call__() method which executes the filter pipeline; no external communication or file operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into filter objects through arguments; execution occurs via __internal_call__, processing images internally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of internal methods is standard for such bindings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated Python wrapper for ITK filters, primarily involving class definitions, factory functions, and method calls. No network, file, or system commands are present. The invocation of __internal_call__() is a controlled internal API call to execute the filter pipeline, not an external or malicious operation. The code handles untrusted inputs in a typical manner for image processing libraries. No obfuscation or backdoors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2) are consistent with the code's structure and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard binding code for ITK image filters, with no malicious activity or sabotage. The use of internal execution methods does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain security risk is very low.",
