{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an auto-generated SWIG wrapper for C++ ITK modules, facilitating Python bindings without performing any external data handling or network operations.",
  "sources": "Module imports, version checks, class attribute protections, helper functions, and module initialization code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, outputs, or data sinks are present; the code does not process external inputs or perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "The code primarily manages module imports and class attribute settings; there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present; the code is standard auto-generated binding code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SWIG-generated interface layer for C++ libraries, with no external data handling, network activity, or malicious patterns. It includes version checks, module imports, and class attribute management functions, all of which are standard. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The low security risk score (around 0.1) and zero malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate given the benign and auto-generated nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard auto-generated SWIG wrapper code with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are consistent with its content, and no further action is necessary.",
