{
  "purpose": "The code is a generated Python wrapper for C++ libraries using SWIG, facilitating interaction with ITK imaging libraries.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and libraries; defines helper functions and classes for SWIG object management.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external network interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily setting up class wrappers and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior; standard SWIG-generated wrapper code with version checks and class helpers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SWIG-generated wrapper for C++ libraries, including import statements, version checks, class and attribute management functions, and module import logic. It does not contain code that reads untrusted input, connects to external resources, or performs any data leaks. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and standard for SWIG bindings, focusing solely on module and class wrapping.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard auto-generated SWIG wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions to facilitate bindings between Python and C++ libraries without performing any potentially harmful operations.",
