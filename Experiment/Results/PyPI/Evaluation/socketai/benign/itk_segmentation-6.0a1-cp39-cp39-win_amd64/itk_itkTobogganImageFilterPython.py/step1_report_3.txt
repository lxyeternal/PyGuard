{
  "purpose": "This code is a Python wrapper generated by SWIG for interfacing with C/C++ modules related to ITK image processing libraries.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules and libraries, such as _ITKCommonPython, _ITKWatershedsPython, and _itkTobogganImageFilterPython.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or sensitive data handling; typical module imports and class definitions.",
  "flows": "The code sets up module imports and class decorators, with no data flow from external sources to sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present. The code appears to be automatically generated boilerplate for module wrapping.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard SWIG-generated wrapper code for C++ modules, including import checks, version enforcement, and helper functions for class attribute management. No code injection, malicious data handling, or suspicious behavior is evident. All operations are related to module setup and class attribute enforcement, with no external data manipulation or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical generated wrapper for C++ modules used in image processing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities.",
