  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a standard auto-generated SWIG wrapper with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified; reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are both 0, and security risk is 0.1, which seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Justification for risk score > 0.5?** Not applicable; the score is low.\n- **Overall:** The report's assessment aligns with the code content.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is typical SWIG-generated binding code.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None; reasoning is accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is boilerplate SWIG wrapper code.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None; the analysis is correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0.\n- **Overall:** Valid conclusion.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Standard SWIG interface code.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0.\n- **Overall:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is typical SWIG setup code.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify that this code is auto-generated SWIG wrapper code with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the content.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard auto-generated code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks detected)\n\nThis code is benign and serves as a standard interface layer between Python and C++ libraries. No further action needed.",
