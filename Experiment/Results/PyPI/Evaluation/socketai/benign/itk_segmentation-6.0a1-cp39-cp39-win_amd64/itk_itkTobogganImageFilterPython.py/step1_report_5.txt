{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and manages SWIG-generated Python bindings for a C++ library, ensuring proper importing, version compatibility, and class attribute management.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, builtins, and several internal SWIG modules; no direct user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data transmission points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Initialization and configuration flow from importing modules, checking Python version, and setting class attribute behaviors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code strictly adheres to typical SWIG wrapper patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SWIG-generated binding setup for Python, handling version checks, module imports, and class attribute protections. No hardcoded credentials, network activities, or malicious logic are present. It does not perform any data processing, input handling, or output operations that could be exploited. The code's structure and content are consistent with typical wrapper code, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, auto-generated SWIG binding setup with no malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages module imports and class attribute protections without external interactions or sensitive data handling.",
