  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is auto-generated SWIG bindings for ITK label voting filters, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Evaluation:** The report correctly notes the nature of the code—bindings, wrappers, and a safe interface. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.5 (or lower). The report's assigned scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the auto-generated nature and lack of malicious behavior, with a slight concern about security risk (0.1).\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning is sound; the code is standard binding code, with no external communication or malicious logic. The minor security risk score accounts for potential misuse, but no actual vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1. These seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is auto-generated bindings with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Evaluation:** The analysis correctly states that the code is typical binding code, with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or external communication.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The assigned scores are justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the benign nature of the auto-generated binding code.\n- **Evaluation:** No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected. The call to __internal_call__() is standard in ITK wrappers.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1. These are reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—auto-generated, safe, with no malicious elements.\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning aligns with the previous assessments; no external communication, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the auto-generated, straightforward binding code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly very low (0.1 or 0.5), which is reasonable considering the code's function and lack of external communication.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear, auto-generated bindings, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, mostly due to the potential for misuse if the API is misused, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe set of Python bindings for ITK label voting filters. No malicious or sabotage signals are present. The low risk score reflects typical concerns about misuse, not actual security flaws.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further detailed analysis or specific focus on any part.",
