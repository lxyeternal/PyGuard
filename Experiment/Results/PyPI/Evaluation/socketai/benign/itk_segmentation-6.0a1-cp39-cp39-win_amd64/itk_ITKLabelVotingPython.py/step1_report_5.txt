{
  "purpose": "This code is an automatically generated wrapper for C++ modules using SWIG, primarily facilitating Python bindings for ITK image processing libraries.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules and C++ extensions, reads from system modules (sys, builtins), and imports several ITK Python modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present; the code primarily sets up class decorators and imports.",
  "flows": "Imports system modules -> loads C++ extension modules -> defines wrapper functions and class decorators -> imports ITK modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. The code is standard boilerplate for SWIG-generated bindings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SWIG wrapper file, automatically generated to expose C++ code to Python. It manages class attributes, adds decorators for metaclasses, and imports necessary modules. No network activity, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are evident. No obfuscated code features are present, and no unusual operations or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SWIG-generated binding for ITK modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as an interface layer and does not perform any data processing or network operations that could be malicious.",
