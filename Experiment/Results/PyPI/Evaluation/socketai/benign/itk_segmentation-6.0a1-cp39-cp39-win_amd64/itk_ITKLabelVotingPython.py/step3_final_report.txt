{
  "purpose": "Auto-generated SWIG wrapper code for ITK C++ image processing modules, facilitating Python bindings.",
  "sources": "Module import statements, attribute setting functions, class decorators, and utility functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, network activity, or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and attribute management functions, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard boilerplate generated by SWIG with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SWIG-generated Python interface for C++ modules, containing functions for attribute management, class decoration, and module imports. It does not perform any network operations, handle external data, or execute dynamic code. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is solely to enable Python to interface with C++ libraries, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely boilerplate for bindings, and poses no security risks or malicious threats. All reports correctly identify it as auto-generated, safe, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and should be maintained.",
