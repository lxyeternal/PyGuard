{
  "purpose": "The code is a generated wrapper for SWIG, which facilitates interfacing between Python and C/C++ modules related to ITK (Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit). Its purpose is to enable the use of C++ image processing libraries in Python.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules (_ITKLabelVotingPython, _ITKThresholdingPython, etc.), and the code reads version info from sys and imports several itk Python modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks that handle untrusted input data, perform network operations, write files, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "The code initializes module imports and defines utility functions for attribute setting and class decoration, with no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard SWIG-generated boilerplate with no obfuscated code, unusual constructs, or hardcoded secrets. The imports and functions are typical for generated interface files.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical auto-generated SWIG wrapper for C++ Python bindings. It defines helper functions for attribute management and imports several itk modules. No malicious patterns, such as network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration, are present. The code does not process external input, nor does it contain dynamic code execution or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard SWIG-generated interface code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely as a bridge between Python and C++ image processing libraries, with no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
