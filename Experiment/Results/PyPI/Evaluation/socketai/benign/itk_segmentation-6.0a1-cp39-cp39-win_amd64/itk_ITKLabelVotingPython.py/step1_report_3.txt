{
  "purpose": "This code is a generated wrapper for the SWIG interface, used to connect C++ libraries (specifically ITK image processing modules) to Python.",
  "sources": "Imports from system modules, SWIG-generated functions, and multiple ITK Python bindings",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data processing points that could lead to data leakage or malicious activity",
  "flows": "The code imports external modules and defines helper functions for attribute management; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. The code is primarily boilerplate for bindings, with no hidden or obfuscated logic",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical SWIG-generated wrapper for C++ ITK modules, containing functions to control attribute assignment and class creation, and importing multiple ITK image processing modules. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation points are present. The code's structure and comments indicate it is auto-generated for library interfacing purposes. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard auto-generated SWIG interface wrapper for ITK Python modules, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a bridge to underlying C++ functionalities without any malicious payload.",
