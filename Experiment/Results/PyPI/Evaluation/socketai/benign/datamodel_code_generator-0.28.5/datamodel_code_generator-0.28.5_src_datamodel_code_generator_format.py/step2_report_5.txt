  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the presence of issues, the appropriateness of their scores, and any inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a code formatter framework, which matches the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Subprocess calls to 'ruff' with code as input—standard for such tools.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials or backdoors; dynamic import of custom modules is controlled via module name strings.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The subprocess calls are standard, and input is from internal variables, reducing risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — low, given the subprocess usage, but acceptable since no malicious intent is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's behavior. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on dynamic module import and subprocess execution.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Potential risks in dynamic import and subprocess calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No explicit malicious code, but potential attack surface in module import and subprocess.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes the risk in dynamic import and subprocess, but notes no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — consistent.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — consistent.  \n- Risk: 0.3 — slightly higher, reflecting moderate concern about dynamic modules and subprocess.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment seems reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, with focus on configuration and dynamic import.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External commands and dynamic modules.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, but potential risk in module import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately notes the potential risks but finds no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with emphasis on subprocess and dynamic import.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Same as above.\n- **Anomalies:** Potential risk in dynamic import and subprocess, but no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious intent, just standard formatting utility.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as previous, with focus on subprocess and dynamic import.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Same.\n- **Anomalies:** Potential attack surface but no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid, no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied between 0.2 and 0.3, reflecting awareness of potential risks in subprocess and dynamic import but acknowledging no active malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured code formatting utility with no malware or obfuscation.\n- The main security concern is the dynamic import and subprocess execution, which are standard but should be used with trusted modules and inputs.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear code.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — moderate, due to dynamic imports and subprocess calls, but acceptable in context.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe within typical usage scenarios.",
