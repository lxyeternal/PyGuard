{
  "purpose": "A code formatting utility that manages code style enforcement using tools like black, isort, and ruff, with support for custom formatters and configuration files.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files (pyproject.toml), code strings passed to formatting functions, and dynamically imports custom formatter modules.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to 'ruff' for linting and formatting, dynamic import of custom formatter modules, and internal function calls for code transformations.",
  "flows": "Code strings are processed through formatters; custom formatters are imported dynamically; subprocess runs 'ruff' commands with code as input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.run with code passed via 'input' parameter; dynamic import of modules based on user-supplied strings; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a legitimate formatting framework invoking external tools and supporting extensibility via dynamic imports. Subprocess calls are standard for code linters/formatters but could pose risks if inputs or modules are malicious. Dynamic import points are controlled but should be used with trusted modules. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess executions are safe within expected usage, and code clarity is high.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, legitimate code formatting utility with minimal security risks. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are detected. The primary concerns involve the dynamic import of modules and subprocess execution, which are inherent to such tools but manageable with trusted inputs. Overall, the code is safe for use in standard environments.",
