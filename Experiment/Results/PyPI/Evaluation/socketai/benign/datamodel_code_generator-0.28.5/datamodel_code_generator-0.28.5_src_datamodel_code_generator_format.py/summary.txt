  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, legitimate code formatting utility with minimal security risks. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are detected. The primary concerns involve the dynamic import of modules and subprocess execution, which are inherent to such tools but manageable with trusted inputs. Overall, the code is safe for use in standard environments."
