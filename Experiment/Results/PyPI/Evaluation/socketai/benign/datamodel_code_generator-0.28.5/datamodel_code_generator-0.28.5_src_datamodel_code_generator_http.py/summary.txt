  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for HTTP requests and URL handling. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) accurately reflect the potential for misuse when handling untrusted input, which is inherent to such functions but not indicative of malicious intent."
