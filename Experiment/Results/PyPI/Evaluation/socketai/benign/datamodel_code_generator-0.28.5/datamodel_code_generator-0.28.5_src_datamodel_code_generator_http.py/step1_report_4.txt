{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to perform HTTP GET requests and URL joining using the httpx library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'url', 'headers', 'ignore_tls', and 'query_parameters' in 'get_body'; 'url' and 'ref' in 'join_url'.",
  "sinks": "The 'httpx.get' call that fetches content from a URL; URL joining operation with 'httpx.URL'.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into 'httpx.get' and 'httpx.URL.join', with external URLs being fetched or manipulated.",
  "anomalies": "The code raises an exception if 'httpx' isn't installed, but does not contain suspicious or malicious logic beyond standard HTTP utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'httpx' and defines two functions: 'get_body' which performs an HTTP GET request with optional headers, TLS verification, and query parameters; 'join_url' which joins a base URL with a reference string. The code has basic input validation and dependency handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The functions rely on the 'httpx' library to perform network operations, which are typical in such utilities. There is no evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity. The only noteworthy aspect is the dependency check, which prompts installation of 'httpx'.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility module for HTTP operations. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. No suspicious anomalies or malicious intent are observed.",
