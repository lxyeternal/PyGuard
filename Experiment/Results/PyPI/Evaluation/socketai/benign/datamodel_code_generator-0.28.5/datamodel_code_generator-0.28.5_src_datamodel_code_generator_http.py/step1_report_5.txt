{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions to perform HTTP GET requests and URL joining using the httpx library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'url', 'headers', 'ignore_tls', and 'query_parameters' in get_body; 'url' and 'ref' in join_url.",
  "sinks": "The get_body function makes an HTTP request which could lead to external data fetching; join_url constructs URLs potentially influenced by untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (url, headers, query_parameters, ref) flows into HTTP request and URL join functions, possibly leading to external request or URL manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The exception message for missing 'httpx' indicates dependency management but not malicious intent. No unusual behaviors or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports httpx, raising an informative error if not installed. The get_body function fetches URL content with customizable headers, TLS verification, and query parameters, which could be exploited if input is malicious but is typical in HTTP client code. The join_url function constructs URLs based on untrusted inputs. Overall, the code performs standard network operations with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of HTTP request and URL manipulation functions with no malicious intent detected. It could be exploited if inputs are malicious but this is typical for such utility code. No malware or security risks identified.",
