  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims with the provided code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, standard utility functions, potential misuse if untrusted input is provided.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No malicious intent, no obfuscation, and the security risk is low due to potential misuse, which is typical for network code. The confidence is high (0.9).  \n- **Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing benign nature, standard library usage, no malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes the absence of malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the confidence is perfect (1).  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Focuses on the potential for misuse via user input leading to malicious requests but finds no actual malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code performs network requests based on user input, which could be exploited but is standard. The risk score reflects potential misuse rather than actual malicious intent.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing standard dependency handling and utility functions, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. The lower risk score reflects minimal inherent risk.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Reiterates the benign nature, potential for misuse, no malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is accurate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk score:** The scores range from 0 to 0.2, reflecting the potential for misuse if untrusted input is used in network requests. This is a reasonable assessment for utility code that interacts with external systems.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** Given the nature of the code, a risk score of around 0.2 seems appropriate, as it depends on how the functions are used.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' evaluations and the code's straightforward functionality.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The potential security risk is inherent to network utility functions and is appropriately scored.",
