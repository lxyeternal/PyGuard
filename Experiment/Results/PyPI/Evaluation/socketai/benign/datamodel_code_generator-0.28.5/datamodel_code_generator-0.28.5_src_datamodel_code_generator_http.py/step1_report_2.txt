{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for making HTTP GET requests and joining URLs using the httpx library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters (url, headers, query_parameters, ignore_tls) and imports the httpx library.",
  "sinks": "The code sends HTTP requests via httpx.get and constructs URLs with httpx.URL.join.",
  "flows": "User input (url, headers, query_parameters, ignore_tls) flows into the get_body function, which then makes an HTTP request; the URL join function constructs URLs based on provided inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. No dynamic execution or obfuscation detected. The exception message references a package installation, which is benign. The use of the httpx library appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and handles ImportError gracefully with a user instruction. The get_body function performs an HTTP GET request, with optional headers, query parameters, and TLS verification control. The join_url function constructs a URL by joining a reference string to the base URL. All operations are typical for HTTP utilities, with no signs of malicious behavior. There are no suspicious data leaks, backdoors, or malicious network activities. The code is straightforward and appears to be utility functions without hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for making HTTP requests and URL manipulation. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard in its functionality.",
