  "purpose": "CLI tool for generating data models from schemas, URLs, or files with extensive configuration validation.",
  "sources": [
    "Configuration files (pyproject.toml, JSON files)",
    "Command-line arguments",
    "Standard input (stdin)",
    "External files (paths, URLs)"

  ],
  "flows": [
    "Input sources (files, URLs, stdin) -> validation and parsing -> generate() call -> output"
  ],
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward with standard validation and file handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a CLI wrapper for a data model generator, performing configuration parsing, validation, and invoking an external generate() function. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. JSON and file handling are done with proper error handling. The generate() function's implementation is external and presumed safe. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured CLI tool with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects typical handling of external files and configurations, which is acceptable in such contexts.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
