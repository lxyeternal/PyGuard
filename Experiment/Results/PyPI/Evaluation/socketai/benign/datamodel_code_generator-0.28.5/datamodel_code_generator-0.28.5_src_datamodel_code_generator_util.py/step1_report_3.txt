{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and configurations for handling models with pydantic, YAML, and TOML files, along with version compatibility handling.",
  "sources": "Imports (pydantic, copy, typing, packaging, yaml, tomllib/tomli), dynamic import of loader functions, and model validation functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or network communication; validation functions are used internally and do not process untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Imports and function definitions; input data (e.g., files) are handled in load_toml, but no external untrusted input flow is explicitly present or processed without validation.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses deep copying for yaml loader constructors, which could be unusual but is standard for customization; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly sets up environment-dependent imports, handles different versions of pydantic, and defines utility decorators for model validation. The import logic appears to aim for compatibility and customization of YAML loaders. No code injections, network activities, or malicious file operations are present. It is standard configuration and utility code, with no obfuscated constructs or hidden backdoors. The validation functions adapt based on pydantic version, but do not invoke any external or untrusted input without proper validation. Overall, the code appears safe and intended for model validation and configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for model validation and configuration management with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It uses environment-aware imports and provides customization hooks, but does not contain any malicious intent or security risks.",
