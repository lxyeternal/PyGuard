  "purpose": "Utility classes and functions for managing references, path resolution, naming conventions, and URL handling within schema or code generation tools.",
  "sources": "Input data from class attributes, function parameters, environment variables, and external references (paths, URLs).",
  "sinks": "Reference resolution, path joining, URL construction, class and name generation, potentially exposing data leaks or injection points if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "External inputs flow into functions like resolve_ref, add_id, get_class_name, and path/url manipulation functions, which process and generate references and paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Path and URL handling are standard but could be exploited if inputs are malicious and validation is insufficient.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured utility module for managing references, paths, and naming conventions. It uses validation, regex filtering, and URL parsing to mitigate common risks. No malicious payloads or backdoors are present. The primary concern is potential exploitation via crafted inputs in functions like resolve_ref and path resolution, which could lead to path traversal or injection if inputs are untrusted. The risk scores assigned (0, 0.1, 0.2-0.4) are consistent with the code's behavior and validation measures. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low to moderate, depending on input validation rigor.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. It is a standard utility module for schema/reference management. Proper validation of external inputs is recommended to prevent potential exploitation. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
