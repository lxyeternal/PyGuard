  "sources": "Class methods and constants defining import paths; internal data structures for managing import info.",
  "sinks": "Generation of import statement strings; internal data updates; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "Internal data structures (dicts, sets) manipulated during append/remove operations; string formatting for output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no external input handling, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for managing import statements, with well-structured data management and string generation. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic execution are present. The use of lru_cache is benign. The constants for common typing imports are static and safe. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are evident. The code's purpose is purely organizational, with no security or malicious implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for managing import statements in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low at 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk in static code of this nature.",
