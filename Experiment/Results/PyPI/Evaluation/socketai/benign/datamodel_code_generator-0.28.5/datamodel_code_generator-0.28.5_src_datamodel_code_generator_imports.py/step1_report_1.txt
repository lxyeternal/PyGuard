  "purpose": "The code defines classes and constants for managing Python import statements, including import aliasing, reference tracking, and string generation for import blocks.",
  "sources": "Class methods and initializations that create Import instances and manage import data structures.",
  "sinks": "Methods that generate import statement strings (`create_line`, `dump`) and modify internal state (`append`, `remove`, `remove_referenced_imports`).",
  "flows": "Import instances are created from full paths, stored, modified, and eventually converted into import statement strings for code generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a utility for handling import statements, including aliasing and reference tracking, with no operations involving external inputs, network communication, or file manipulation that could be malicious. It mainly manages internal data structures, generates import statements, and tracks references. The use of `lru_cache` for caching is benign and standard. All imports are related to type annotations and standard library modules, with no indication of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing Python import statements with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior. It operates solely on internal data structures and code generation related to imports.",
