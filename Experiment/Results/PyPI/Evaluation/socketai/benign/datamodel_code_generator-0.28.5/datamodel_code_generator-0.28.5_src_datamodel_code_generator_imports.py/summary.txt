  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for managing import statements in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low at 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk in static code of this nature."
