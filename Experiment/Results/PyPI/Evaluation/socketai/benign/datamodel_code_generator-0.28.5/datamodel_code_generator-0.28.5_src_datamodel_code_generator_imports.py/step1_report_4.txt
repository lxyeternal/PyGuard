  "purpose": "Define classes and utilities for managing Python import statements, including parsing, aliasing, and serialization.",
  "sources": "Class methods, property initializations, and utility functions that process import data and manipulate import collections.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the methods that modify internal state such as 'append', 'remove', and 'remove_referenced_imports', which handle import data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to internal data structures through methods like 'append' and 'remove', but there are no untrusted sources or external inputs explicitly handled here.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code is present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. The code performs standard data management for imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines 'Import' and 'Imports' classes to manage Python import statements, including full path parsing, aliasing, and dumping to code strings. It utilizes standard library features and common design patterns. No external data sources or network activity is involved. The methods modify internal data structures without executing untrusted code or external commands. The use of 'lru_cache' for 'from_full_path' is safe and standard. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malware are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for managing import statements, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely handles data structures and string generation for code imports, and does not include any network activity, file manipulation, or other malicious behaviors.",
