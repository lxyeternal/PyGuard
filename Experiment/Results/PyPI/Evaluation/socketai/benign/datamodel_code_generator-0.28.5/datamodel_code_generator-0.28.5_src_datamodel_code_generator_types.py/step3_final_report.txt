{
  "purpose": "The code manages data types, validation, and import logic for a code generator, with input data including type strings and class properties.",
  "sources": "Places where code reads input or data include type string manipulations in functions like _remove_none_from_union, get_optional_type, and type hint generation based on class properties.",
  "sinks": "Places where untrusted data can lead to potential data leak or effect are string manipulations and type hint outputs, but no dynamic code execution or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Source-to-sink paths involve input strings being processed by functions such as _remove_none_from_union and get_optional_type, influencing type hint strings and import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Functions perform standard string parsing and handling without eval, exec, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data type management, string manipulation for type hints, and import handling. Functions like _remove_none_from_union and get_optional_type are deterministic and do not execute untrusted code. No obfuscation or malicious activity is evident. Use of pydantic.create_model and regex parsing are typical in schema utilities. The overall structure is clear and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and intended for data type management in code generation contexts. No malicious behavior is detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 reflects minimal potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but no active vulnerabilities are present.",
