  "purpose": "This script simulates the behavior of the 'fgrep' command by searching for a pattern within input lines from stdin and printing matching lines.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1] (command-line argument), sys.stdin (standard input stream)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write(line) (output of matching lines)",
  "flows": "pattern (from sys.argv[1]) flows into the if condition; stdin lines flow into the condition; matching lines flow to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. No external or network operations. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code takes a pattern argument from the command line and reads input lines from stdin. For each line, if the pattern exists within the line, it outputs the line to stdout. There are no external network calls, no use of environment variables, and no obfuscated or dynamic code. The logic is simple and intended for text matching. No malicious behavior or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a basic text filtering utility mimicking 'fgrep'. It performs no malicious actions or security risks. The code is simple, transparent, and functionally straightforward.",
