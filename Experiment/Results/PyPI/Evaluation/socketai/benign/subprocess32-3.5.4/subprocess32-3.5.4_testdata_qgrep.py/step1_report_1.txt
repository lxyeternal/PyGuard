{
  "purpose": "This script simulates a simplified version of the 'fgrep' command, searching for a pattern within lines of input provided via stdin.",
  "sources": "Reads input from sys.stdin, and reads the pattern from sys.argv[1].",
  "sinks": "Outputs matching lines to sys.stdout.",
  "flows": "Pattern from sys.argv[1] is used to filter stdin lines; matching lines are written to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual code behavior observed. No external network access or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code takes a command-line argument as a pattern, then reads lines from stdin. If the pattern is found within a line, that line is written to stdout. It functions as a basic text filter. The implementation appears straightforward with no suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects. The code does not process or store sensitive information beyond reading from stdin and writing to stdout.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign text filtering script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs a basic pattern match without any suspicious behavior.",
