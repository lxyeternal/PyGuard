  "purpose": "A simple script to search for a pattern in standard input lines, mimicking basic 'fgrep' functionality.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from sys.stdin, and reads a pattern from sys.argv[1].",
  "sinks": "Outputs matching lines to sys.stdout.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.stdin (untrusted data) is checked for pattern matches; matching lines are written to sys.stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual variables. The script performs basic pattern matching without external network interactions or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to access command-line arguments and standard input/output. When executed, it retrieves a pattern from the first argument. It then iterates over each line of standard input, printing lines that contain the pattern. The logic is straightforward and mimics basic 'grep'-like functionality without additional features or external calls. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no hidden backdoors, or suspicious data handling. It processes data securely and simply.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a basic pattern searcher with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for a simple text filtering tool. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
