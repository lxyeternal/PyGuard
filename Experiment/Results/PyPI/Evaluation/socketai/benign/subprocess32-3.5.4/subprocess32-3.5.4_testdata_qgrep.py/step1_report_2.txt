  "purpose": "Simulate the 'fgrep' command by searching for a pattern in input lines",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1] (command-line argument), sys.stdin (standard input stream)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (output of matching lines)",
  "flows": "pattern from sys.argv[1] -> check if pattern in line -> write matching line to sys.stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; straightforward pattern matching",
  "analysis": "The script reads a pattern from command-line arguments, then iterates over each line in standard input. If the pattern is found within a line, it writes that line to standard output. The code is simple and directly implements a basic search functionality without any complex or suspicious behavior. There are no obfuscation techniques, dynamic code execution, or malicious payloads present. The code does not appear to leak data, access sensitive information, or connect to external systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic pattern search on input data and outputs matching lines. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks in this implementation.",
