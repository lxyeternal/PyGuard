  "purpose": "List open file descriptors, either all or specified ones, for system inspection.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for specific FDs; uses os.fstat to check each FD.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; outputs list of FDs to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input: command-line args; Output: printed list of FDs.",
  "anomalies": "Uses broad exception handling for os.sysconf; no input validation for FD arguments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward script to list open file descriptors, handling maximum FD count via sysconf or defaulting to 256. It filters out invalid FDs and Solaris door files if applicable. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. Exception handling is broad but not security-critical. The script's purpose is system inspection, with minimal security risk. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The reports are empty and do not provide additional concerns. The overall security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is negligible.",
