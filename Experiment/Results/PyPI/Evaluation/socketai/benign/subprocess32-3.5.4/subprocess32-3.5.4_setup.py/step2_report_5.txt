  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a legitimate build utility for a Python subprocess backport, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious activities. The os.system call is standard for build scripts.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low).\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The code performs typical build steps, with no signs of malicious intent. The low risk score is appropriate.  \n**No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the potential risk if './configure' is compromised.\n- **Findings:** The use of timestamp checks before running './configure' is standard; no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrectly notes that the main risk is external './configure' script compromise, but the code itself is benign. The risk score reflects this appropriately.  \n**No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup for building a Python package, with timestamp checks and external script execution.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code or obfuscation; the use of os.system() is typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The code is straightforward, and the risk is mainly external (the './configure' script). The low risk score is justified.  \n**No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with a note that executing './configure' could be risky if compromised.\n- **Findings:** The use of os.system() to run external scripts introduces potential risk if the script is malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.4.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is reasonable. The code itself isn't malicious, but the external script execution could be exploited if the './configure' script is malicious. The higher risk score (0.4) appropriately reflects this potential.  \n**No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard package setup, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** Uses static commands; no external input into os.system().\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The code is typical for setup scripts, with minimal risk. The low risk score is justified.  \n**No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (score=0). The code is a standard build/setup script.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The highest risk score assigned is 0.4, which is appropriate given the external './configure' script execution. External scripts could be malicious if compromised, but the code itself isn't malicious.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 to 0.4, depending on external script trustworthiness. Given the context, I would assign:\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (since the main concern is external script execution, which is common in build processes but not inherently malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a legitimate, standard build setup script with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary concern is the external './configure' script, which should be verified for integrity but does not imply malicious intent in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications to scores are necessary. The code is safe, with minimal inherent risk.",
