{
  "purpose": "The code tests the behavior of subprocess handling and signal management on Linux systems, specifically how child processes are reaped and how poll() handles the ECHILD error.",
  "sources": "Reads system signals (SIGCLD/SIGCHLD), spawns subprocesses, and monitors subprocess status via poll() and wait().",
  "sinks": "The subprocesses output is printed to stdout; no direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Signal handling affects subprocess reaping; subprocess output is captured via wait() and poll(), flow is controlled by sleep loops and exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a non-standard subprocess module 'subprocess32', which may indicate compatibility or specific environment needs. No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets present. No unusual code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up signal handling to ignore child process signals, then spawns subprocesses that print 'albatross'. It tests whether the subprocesses terminate as expected and whether poll() handles the ECHILD error correctly. The logic is straightforward, focusing on system behavior validation without any suspicious or malicious operations. No external data input, no secret keys, or network operations are involved. The code's structure is standard and well-commented, indicating a testing utility rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a system behavior test related to process reaping and signal handling on Linux. It contains no malicious or maliciously intended behavior. It appears to be legitimate testing code for subprocess and signal interactions, with no security risks identified.",
