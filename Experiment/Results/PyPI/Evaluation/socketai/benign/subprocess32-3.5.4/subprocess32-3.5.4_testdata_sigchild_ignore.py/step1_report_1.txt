{
  "purpose": "The code appears to test process reaping behavior on Linux systems, specifically how signal handling and subprocess management interact with system calls like waitpid.",
  "sources": "Reads from subprocess output via subprocess32.Popen, signal handling setup, and timing loops.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess32.Popen to spawn processes and wait for them; no data is written to untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "Signal handling modifies system behavior; subprocess creation spawns new processes; polling loop monitors subprocess status.",
  "anomalies": "Uses signal.SIG_IGN to ignore SIGCHLD/SIGCLD, which can lead to unhandled child processes; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; no suspicious external communications.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up signal handling to ignore child process termination signals, then spawns a subprocess that prints 'albatross' and waits for it. It then spawns another subprocess and polls repeatedly until completion, raising an error if it takes too long. The purpose is to test behavior of waitpid and poll under signal handling conditions. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code appears to be intended for testing or debugging system call interactions and does not include malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign; it is designed to test subprocess and signal behavior on Linux. No malicious behavior or malware is evident, and there are no security risks posed by this code.",
