{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be testing signal handling and subprocess management behavior on Linux systems, specifically related to child process reaping and polling for process completion.",
  "sources": "The code reads system signal constants ('SIGCLD' or 'SIGCHLD'), subprocess output, and the number of polling iterations.",
  "sinks": "The subprocesses execute simple Python commands; no external data sinks or untrusted data flows are apparent.",
  "flows": "Signal handling is set to ignore child termination signals, then subprocesses are spawned and waited upon; polling monitors process completion without external input affecting flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses deprecated or platform-specific signal handling; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. No suspicious network activity or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The script manages child processes and handles system signals to test subprocess behavior under specific OS conditions. It does not perform data injection, exfiltration, or system manipulation. Signal ignoring and polling are standard techniques for process management. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign process management test script, aimed at verifying behavior of subprocess handling and signal management on Linux. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
