{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to read input lines from standard input and process them when executed as a script.",
  "sources": "sys.stdin (reading input lines from standard input)",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data is written or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.stdin flows into the loop, but no processing or output occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code does nothing with the input data; it simply iterates over each line and passes. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script checks if it is run as the main module, then loops over each line of input from stdin, but performs no operations inside the loop. It appears to be a placeholder or minimal input-consuming stub. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code is very simple and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as a minimal input-consuming placeholder, and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not process or transmit data beyond reading input lines.",
