{
  "purpose": "The script reads input lines from standard input and processes them (though no processing occurs).",
  "sources": "sys.stdin (reading from standard input)",
  "sinks": "None present; no output or data leakage mechanisms observed.",
  "flows": "Input read from sys.stdin; no further processing or data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code simply consumes input without performing actions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and, when executed as a script, loops through each line of standard input but performs no operation on the input. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code execution, or harmful side effects. The structure is minimal and straightforward, with no hidden or obfuscated code. The absence of output or network activity suggests no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning only to consume input without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a placeholder or stub for further development.",
