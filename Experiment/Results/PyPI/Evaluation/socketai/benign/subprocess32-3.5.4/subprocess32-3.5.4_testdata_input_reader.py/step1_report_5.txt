{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to consume input from standard input when executed as a standalone program.",
  "sources": "sys.stdin (reading input data from standard input stream)",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not process or output data beyond reading it",
  "flows": "Input data flows from sys.stdin to a pass statement that discards it; no further processing occurs",
  "anomalies": "The loop reads input lines but performs no operations, which is unusual but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code checks if it is executed as a script, then enters a loop reading each line from standard input and discards it. There are no functions, data processing, or network operations. It neither processes nor leaks data, nor does it perform any suspicious actions. The script may serve as a placeholder or a minimal input-consuming stub, but there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to consume input without processing or transmitting data. It shows no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
