{
  "purpose": "The code reads lines from standard input and discards them, acting as a minimal placeholder or utility.",
  "sources": "sys.stdin during the for loop when run as a script",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed, output, or transmitted",
  "flows": "Input from sys.stdin flows into the loop, but no further actions are taken",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal, with no obfuscation or malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and, if executed directly, loops over each line of input, doing nothing with it. It does not perform any processing, output, or side effects. The code is simple, clear, and benign. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The minimal input reading could be misused in certain contexts, but in isolation, it poses no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder that consumes input without side effects. All signals indicate no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 (or 0.1 in the cautious report). No modifications are necessary.",
