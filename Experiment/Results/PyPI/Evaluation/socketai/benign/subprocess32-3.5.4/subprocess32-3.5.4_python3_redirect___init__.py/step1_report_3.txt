{
  "purpose": "To set up a redirect for the subprocess module when installed as subprocess32, ensuring compatibility with older Python versions.",
  "sources": "sys.modules['subprocess32'] = subprocess",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks or untrusted data handling; no network, file, or environment variable interactions.",
  "flows": "Import subprocess -> Check Python version -> Assign subprocess to subprocess32 in sys.modules",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a version check and manipulates sys.modules to alias subprocess as subprocess32, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script verifies the Python version and raises an error if the version is too old. It then assigns the subprocess module to sys.modules under the name 'subprocess32' to support installations that expect subprocess32. This is a compatibility measure. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data leaks, no network activity, and no apparent malicious functions. The code is straightforward, intended solely for compatibility, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple compatibility shim for older Python versions that redirects subprocess to subprocess32. No malicious behavior, no security risks identified, and no anomalies suggesting sabotage or malware.",
