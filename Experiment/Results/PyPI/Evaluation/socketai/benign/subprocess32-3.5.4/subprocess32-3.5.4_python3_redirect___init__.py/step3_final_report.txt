  "purpose": "Provides compatibility for older Python versions by redirecting 'subprocess32' to the standard 'subprocess' module.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "Assigns the subprocess module to sys.modules['subprocess32'].",
  "flows": "Version check leads to potential ImportError; module assignment modifies sys.modules for compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual assignment of subprocess to sys.modules['subprocess32'], but this is a known pattern for compatibility, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward version check and assigns the subprocess module to a sys.modules key for compatibility with older Python versions. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious code are present. The module assignment is unconventional but justified for compatibility purposes. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility shim with no malicious intent or security risks. The assignment to sys.modules['subprocess32'] is unusual but not malicious. The overall security risk is negligible.",
