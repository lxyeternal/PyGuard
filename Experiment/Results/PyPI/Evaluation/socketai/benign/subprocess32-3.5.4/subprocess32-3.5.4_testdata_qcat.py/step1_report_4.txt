  "purpose": "The script simulates the 'cat' command by reading from standard input and writing to standard output.",
  "sources": "Reads data from sys.stdin (standard input).",
  "sinks": "Writes data to sys.stdout (standard output).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sys.stdin to sys.stdout without modification or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads each line from standard input and writes it directly to standard output, effectively mirroring input data. There are no external data sources, no manipulation of data, and no suspicious functions or imports. The script performs a simple pass-through operation resembling the 'cat' utility. No security issues or malicious behavior are present in this straightforward implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a 'cat'-like utility with no malicious intent or security risks.",
