  "purpose": "The script simulates the 'cat' command by echoing input lines to standard output when run as a script.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from sys.stdin",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to sys.stdout",
  "flows": "Data flows from sys.stdin to sys.stdout directly, without modification or processing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscation or suspicious functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal implementation of a 'cat'-like utility, reading input lines and writing them to output unchanged. It uses standard input/output streams and has no additional logic, external network connections, or data manipulations. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs a simple, benign operation of copying stdin to stdout. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks identified.",
