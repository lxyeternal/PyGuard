  "purpose": "Simulates the 'cat' command by outputting whatever is read from standard input.",
  "sources": "Reads data from sys.stdin",
  "sinks": "Writes data to sys.stdout",
  "flows": "Input from sys.stdin flows directly to sys.stdout",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward input-output pass-through",
  "analysis": "The code reads input line-by-line from standard input and writes each line directly to standard output without any processing. No external data, credentials, or sensitive information are used or transmitted. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present. The code functions as a simple file content repeater, which is typical for a 'cat' utility simulation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign implementation of a 'cat'-like utility with no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious patterns. It performs a basic input-output passthrough as intended.",
