  "purpose": "The script simulates the 'cat' command by echoing input lines to output when run as a script.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from sys.stdin",
  "sinks": "Writes output data to sys.stdout",
  "flows": "Data flows from sys.stdin to sys.stdout through the for loop",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors detected; simple input-output echoing",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module, then, when executed as a script, reads lines from standard input and writes them directly to standard output. There are no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no external network connections, and no suspicious operations. The code's behavior is straightforward and resembles a basic implementation of the 'cat' utility. No security issues or malicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple input-output echo script mimicking 'cat' functionality with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
