  "purpose": "The script simulates the 'cat' command by echoing standard input to standard output when run as a script.",
  "sources": "Reads input from sys.stdin (standard input).",
  "sinks": "Writes output to sys.stdout (standard output).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sys.stdin to sys.stdout through a loop, with no external or untrusted data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is simple and straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if it is run as the main program, then iterates over each line in standard input, writing each line directly to standard output. It effectively replicates the 'cat' command. There are no external dependencies, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious operations. The code does not perform any network activity, data storage, or system modification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign script that acts as a passthrough for input to output. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
