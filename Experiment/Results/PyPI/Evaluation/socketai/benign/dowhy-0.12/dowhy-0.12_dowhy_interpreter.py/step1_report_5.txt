{
  "purpose": "Defines a base class for interpretation methods of causal models, estimates, or refutations in the dowhy library.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (logging, dowhy.causal_estimator, dowhy.causal_model, dowhy.causal_refuter).",
  "targets": "None directly; the code sets attributes and logs errors but does not execute any sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Initialization assigns class instances based on type; no untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The logger is initialized after use, which may cause an error but not maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines a class for interpreting causal models, estimates, or refutations. It verifies instance types and sets attributes accordingly, with an error log if types are unsupported. No data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious activity are present. The logger is created after an error message, which is a minor implementation detail but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be standard code for a modeling framework.",
