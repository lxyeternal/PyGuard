{
  "purpose": "Defines a base class for causal discovery methods in a larger framework.",
  "sources": "Data input through the constructor parameter 'data'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'data' parameter to internal attributes; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "The class is straightforward with no unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. No code execution, dynamic imports, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple base class with an initializer setting internal attributes based on provided data. It contains a placeholder method 'learn_graph' intended to be implemented by subclasses. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as network communication, file manipulation, or hidden backdoors. Usage of a standard class structure for modular design is typical. No suspicious code elements, secrets, or obfuscated patterns are present. The code appears to be a normal part of a machine learning or data analysis library, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard base class for causal discovery methods with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, suspicious data flows, or malicious code. The risk level is very low.",
