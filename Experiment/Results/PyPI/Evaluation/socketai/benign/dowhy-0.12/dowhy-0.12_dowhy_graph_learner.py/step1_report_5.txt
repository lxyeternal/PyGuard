  "purpose": "Define a base class for causal discovery methods, intended for subclass implementation.",
  "sources": "Data input via the constructor parameter 'data'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no output or external data transmission occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor input into class attributes; no external flows or network interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard class and method definitions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes with a dataset, storing columns as labels and setting placeholders for an adjacency matrix and graph in DOT format. The 'learn_graph' method is abstract and raises NotImplementedError, implying intended extension. There are no external data transmissions, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The code is a typical base class pattern with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple base class definition for causal discovery, with no malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks detected. It is purely structural and intended for extension.",
