  "purpose": "Base class for causal discovery methods, serving as a framework component.",
  "sources": "Initialization with data, extraction of column labels.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Data passed to constructor; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definition with abstract method.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a benign, standard base class for causal discovery. It initializes data attributes, extracts column labels, and declares an abstract method 'learn_graph'. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are evident. The small security risk score likely reflects the generic framework context rather than actual threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, well-structured base class with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
