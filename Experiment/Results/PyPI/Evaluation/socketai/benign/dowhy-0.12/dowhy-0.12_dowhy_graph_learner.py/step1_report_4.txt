{
  "purpose": "Define a base class for causal discovery methods used in the 'dowhy' package, facilitating different implementations of graph learning algorithms.",
  "sources": "Initialization method (__init__) with input parameters 'data', 'library_class', '*args', '**kwargs'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data outputs, network calls, or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameter 'data' into the class attribute '_data'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present. The class is straightforward and typical for a modeling framework.",
  "analysis": "The class serves as a base for causal discovery, initializing data and labels, and providing an abstract method 'learn_graph' intended for subclasses to implement specific algorithms. There are no network operations, file manipulations, or code execution beyond class setup. No signs of malicious behavior or suspicious code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured base class for a causal discovery framework, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or data leaks.",
