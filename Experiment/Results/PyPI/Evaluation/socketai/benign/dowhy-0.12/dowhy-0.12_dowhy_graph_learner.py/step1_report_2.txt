{
  "purpose": "Defines a base class for causal discovery methods, intended to be subclassed for specific algorithms.",
  "sources": "Data passed to the constructor (__init__) as the 'data' parameter.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data outputs identified; no external data transmission or storage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'data' parameter into internal attributes; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The class is abstract and provides a framework.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple, well-structured base class for causal discovery with a constructor initializing data attributes and an unimplemented 'learn_graph' method. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It appears to be a standard implementation pattern for machine learning or data analysis frameworks. No external network activity, no code injection, and no suspicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward abstract class for causal discovery purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign, standard component within a larger package.",
