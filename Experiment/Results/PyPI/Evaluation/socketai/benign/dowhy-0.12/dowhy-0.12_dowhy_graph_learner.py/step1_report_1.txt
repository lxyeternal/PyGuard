{
  "purpose": "Defines a base class for causal discovery methods used in analyzing data to discover causal graphs.",
  "sources": "Input data provided during class instantiation (self._data), specifically reading data.columns to get labels.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the class is primarily a structure for causal discovery, with no data leakage or malicious output.",
  "flows": "Data is passed in __init__, and internal attributes are set; no complex data flow paths to suspicious sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no unusual or suspicious code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "This code defines a simple base class with an __init__ method initializing data attributes and a placeholder method learn_graph that should be overridden in subclasses. No dynamic execution, external data fetches, or suspicious patterns are present. The class documentation indicates it is part of a larger causal discovery package, which is standard for scientific libraries. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard base class for causal discovery, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a normal, benign component of a data analysis library.",
