{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for plotting treatment/outcome data and causal effect analysis, saving the resulting figures as timestamped PNG files.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (treatment, outcome, time_var, estimate, treatment, outcome) and system time via datetime.now() for filename timestamps.",
  "sinks": "Saves generated plots as image files; no external data transmission or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to plotting functions; filenames are generated using datetime.now() for timestamping; images are saved locally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard plotting routines; use of datetime for filenames is common and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward data visualization using matplotlib, with no external data fetching, network activity, or malicious code. It uses standard libraries and practices, with filenames timestamped using datetime.now(). No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The slight risk score of 0.1 in some reports is justified by the filename timestamping but does not pose a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are consistent with its benign functionality. No further action is necessary.",
