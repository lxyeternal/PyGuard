{
  "purpose": "The code defines two functions for plotting treatment outcomes and causal effects, primarily for visualizing data related to treatment analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters: 'treatment', 'outcome', 'time_var', and 'estimate'. It also uses the current date and time via 'datetime.now()' for filenames.",
  "sinks": "The code writes plot images to files named with timestamps, potentially for later review or sharing. No other data output or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Input data (treatment, outcome, time_var, estimate) flows into plotting functions; 'datetime.now()' generates timestamped filenames for saving figures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard plotting routines. Usage of 'datetime.now()' for filenames is normal and does not pose a security risk. No hardcoded secrets, code injection, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, sets visualization parameters, and plots data. It saves images with timestamped filenames, which is typical for data visualization workflows. No use of untrusted input, network activity, or malicious code. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward data visualization utility for treatment and causal effect analysis. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks detected.",
