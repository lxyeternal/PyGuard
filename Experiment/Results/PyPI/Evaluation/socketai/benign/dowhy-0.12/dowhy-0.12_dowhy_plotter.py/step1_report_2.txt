{
  "purpose": "The code generates and saves plots related to treatment outcomes and causal effects for data visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function arguments: 'treatment', 'outcome', 'time_var', and 'estimate'. Uses datetime.now() for timestamping filenames.",
  "sinks": "Saves generated plots as PNG files with timestamps in filenames.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function arguments to plotting commands, then to file output via fig.savefig(). Timestamp generation for filenames is from system clock.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries (matplotlib, datetime) for plotting. It sets font sizes globally via plt.rc(). The functions generate plots with labels, legends, and save images with timestamped filenames. Filename construction uses datetime.now() for timestamping, which is standard. No suspicious code, hidden data exfiltration, or system access observed. The code appears to be straightforward data visualization for analytical purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data visualization module for plotting treatment and causal effect data. There are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It uses common libraries and practices, and the filenames are timestamped for versioning or record-keeping.",
