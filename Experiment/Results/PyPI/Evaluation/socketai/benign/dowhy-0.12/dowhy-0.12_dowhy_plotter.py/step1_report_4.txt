{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate and save plots related to treatment outcomes and causal effect estimations.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function arguments (treatment, outcome, time_var, estimate), and uses datetime for timestamping filenames.",
  "sinks": "Saves generated plots as PNG files with timestamped filenames.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs into plotting functions, which then save images to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. Uses standard libraries and functions appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code sets plotting parameters, generates plots, annotates them, and saves them with timestamped filenames. It does not perform network operations, access environment variables, or handle sensitive data. The filenames include timestamps to prevent overwriting. No obfuscated code, malicious instructions, or suspicious external calls are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward visualization utility for treatment and causal effect data. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks were found.",
