{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate and save plots for treatment outcomes and causal effects using matplotlib.",
  "sources": "The code reads datetime for timestamping filenames; input data for plotting is passed as parameters (time_var, treatment, outcome, estimate).",
  "sinks": "The code writes plot images to disk with filenames containing timestamps; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into plotting functions; plots are generated and saved as PNG files with timestamped filenames.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The filename generation uses current datetime, which is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two plotting functions that configure matplotlib settings, generate plots with given data, and save images with timestamped filenames. All operations involve data visualization without external network calls, data leaks, or malicious behavior. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs straightforward data visualization tasks with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply saves plot images with timestamped filenames. No malware or security concerns identified.",
