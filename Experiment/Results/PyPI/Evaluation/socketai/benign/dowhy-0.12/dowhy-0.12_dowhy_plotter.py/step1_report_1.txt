{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for plotting treatment and outcome data, as well as estimating and visualizing causal effects, likely for statistical or data analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the parameters 'treatment', 'outcome', 'time_var', and 'estimate'. It also accesses system time via 'datetime.now()' for generating filenames.",
  "sinks": "The generated plot images are saved to the filesystem with filenames containing timestamps. No other sinks such as network communication or data exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "Input data ('treatment', 'outcome', 'time_var', 'estimate') flows into plotting functions. 'datetime.now()' provides current system time for filenames, which flow into file output. There are no network or system command executions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors observed. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no signs of malicious intent. The code strictly visualizes data and saves plots.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions that generate plots using matplotlib. It sets font and size configurations, then creates plots with labels, legends, and annotations. The filenames for saved plots include timestamps generated by 'datetime.now()' to avoid overwriting. No external data fetching, network activity, or system commands are used. The code appears to be standard data visualization code with no malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of data plotting functions for treatment and causal effect visualization. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. It appears safe and legitimate for data analysis tasks.",
