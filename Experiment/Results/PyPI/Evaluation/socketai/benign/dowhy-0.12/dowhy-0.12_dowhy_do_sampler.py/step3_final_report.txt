  "purpose": "A base class for a causal inference sampler implementing do-calculus operations, data manipulation, and sampling methods within pandas DataFrames, relying on external libraries such as dowhy, networkx, numpy, and pandas.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from pandas DataFrame (_data), and input variables from class attributes and sampler objects.",
  "sinks": "Data flows internally within pandas DataFrames; no external network, file, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data is copied into internal DataFrame (_df), modified during disruption and treatment steps, and results are generated via sampling methods, with optional multiprocessing for parallel execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected. Usage of multiprocessing and external libraries is standard and justified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of a causal inference sampling class, handling data internally, performing sampling via user-defined or external sampler objects, and using multiprocessing for efficiency. No external communication, malicious payloads, or obfuscation are present. The code relies on trusted open-source libraries and standard programming constructs. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed. The data flow is controlled and contained within the class, with no external side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a causal inference sampler with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, justified by the absence of external communication and malicious patterns. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). The reports' evaluations are accurate and consistent with this analysis.",
