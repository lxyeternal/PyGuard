{
  "purpose": "Framework for causal inference significance testing, including bootstrap and normal distribution tests, with variable selection and result interpretation.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to class constructors and functions, internal data flows within statistical test functions.",
  "sinks": "Internal data processing; no external data leaks, network calls, or file operations detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through statistical functions, with internal logging and variable selection logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; use of standard practices such as seed setting for reproducibility.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard statistical tests (bootstrap, normal distribution) for causal effect validation, with proper error handling and logging. No external communications, code injection, or obfuscation observed. Use of numpy, scipy, and internal methods aligns with scientific computing norms. Variable selection logic includes validation and error checks, and seed setting is standard for reproducibility. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation of statistical significance testing within a causal inference framework. It shows no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. The use of standard libraries and practices supports its safety. The overall security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is zero.",
