  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation of statistical significance testing within a causal inference framework. It shows no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. The use of standard libraries and practices supports its safety. The overall security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is zero."
