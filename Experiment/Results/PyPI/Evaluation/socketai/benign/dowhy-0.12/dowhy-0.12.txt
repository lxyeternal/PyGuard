The minimal risks associated with external file handling and dynamic imports are typical for such tools and do not constitute active threats. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting the potential attack surface but no active malicious behavior."

The security risk is minimal, justified by the absence of external communication and malicious patterns. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). The reports' evaluations are accurate and consistent with this analysis."
