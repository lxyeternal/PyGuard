  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard causal inference framework, reading from pandas DataFrames, no external sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data exfiltration or system calls; data flows within pandas/numpy.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Permutation during bootstrap is standard.\n- **Analysis:** All operations are typical for statistical causal inference. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Very low security risk; code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on bootstrap and effect estimation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious data transfers; operations are standard.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation. Use of permutation is standard.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; code is a typical statistical implementation.\n- **Conclusion:** Security risk is minimal; code appears legitimate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on causal effect estimation, no external input sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external system interactions; data remains within pandas/numpy.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious routines.\n- **Analysis:** Standard statistical procedures; no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Very low security threat; code is legitimate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard causal inference routines; no external data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data exfiltration or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Typical data manipulation and bootstrap methods; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns; code is benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Implements causal effect estimation; no untrusted sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or data exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious routines.\n- **Analysis:** Standard statistical operations; no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Very low security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity, with scores at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the standard nature of the code, no malicious activity, and typical statistical procedures, the overall security risk is extremely low, with scores around 0.1 to 0.2 in reports.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (minimal, standard statistical code with no evident security issues)\n\n**Note:** The bootstrap permutation testing and data resampling are standard in statistical analysis, not malicious. No external system calls, network activity, or secrets are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of causal inference techniques with no security concerns.",
