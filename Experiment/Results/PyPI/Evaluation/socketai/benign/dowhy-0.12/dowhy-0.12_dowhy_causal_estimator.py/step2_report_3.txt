  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential security implications, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a framework for causal inference, employing bootstrap, permutation testing, effect estimation, and significance testing. No external system calls, data leakage, or obfuscation are evident. Permutation during bootstrap null testing is standard in statistical analysis.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low; the only minor concern is the permutation step, which is standard.\n\n**Conclusion:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard statistical procedures, no external data sources, or malicious activity. User-defined functions could, in theory, execute arbitrary code, but this is typical in flexible data analysis frameworks and not inherently malicious.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — again, very low, standard statistical operations.\n\n**Conclusion:** Consistent. No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical causal inference implementation, with no external system calls, secrets, or obfuscation. Operations involve data manipulation, resampling, and statistical calculations, all standard.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — negligible; no security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs data resampling, permutation testing, effect estimation, and confidence intervals. All are standard in statistical analysis. No external system calls, secrets, or malicious routines are present.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; the code is a standard causal inference library with no suspicious features.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — negligible.\n\n**Conclusion:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or external exploits.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, standard code structure.\n\n- **Risk:** All reports assign very low scores (0.0–0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear, standard, and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Score:** **0.05** — extremely low, given the standard statistical procedures and absence of malicious features.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's functionality. The code is a standard, well-structured causal inference framework with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The risk is minimal, and no changes to scores are necessary.",
