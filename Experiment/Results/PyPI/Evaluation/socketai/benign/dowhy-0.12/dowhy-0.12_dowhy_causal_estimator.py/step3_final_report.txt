{
  "purpose": "This code implements a causal inference framework with bootstrap, permutation testing, effect estimation, and significance testing, primarily operating on pandas DataFrames and numpy arrays for statistical analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data from pandas DataFrames; no external input sources or network calls.",
  "sinks": "No external data exfiltration, network activity, or system modifications; data remains within pandas/numpy structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows within pandas/numpy operations; bootstrap resampling and permutation are standard statistical procedures; no external or malicious data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious routines detected; permutation during bootstrap is a standard statistical method, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard statistical techniques for causal effect estimation, including bootstrap and permutation tests. It manipulates data within pandas DataFrames, performs resampling, and calculates effects without external system calls or network activity. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious routines are present. The use of permutation testing and bootstrap resampling is common in statistical analysis, and the code structure is clear and well-documented. The potential concern about user-defined functions executing arbitrary code is a known risk but not inherently malicious, and the code does not perform any suspicious actions beyond typical statistical procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of causal inference methods with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate. Overall, the code poses minimal security concerns and can be considered safe for use.",
