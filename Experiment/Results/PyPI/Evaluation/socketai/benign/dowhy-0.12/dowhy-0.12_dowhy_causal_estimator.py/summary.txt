  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of causal inference methods with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate. Overall, the code poses minimal security concerns and can be considered safe for use."
