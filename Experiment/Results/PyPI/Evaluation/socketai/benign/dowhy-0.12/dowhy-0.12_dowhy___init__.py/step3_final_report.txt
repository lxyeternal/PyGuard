  "purpose": "Module setup for the 'dowhy' causal inference library, importing key functions and classes, configuring logging, and defining version and export symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'dowhy' library, version string, logging configuration",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network communication, or external command execution",
  "flows": "Importing functions/classes, setting up logging, defining version and exports",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup module that imports specific functions and classes from the 'dowhy' library, configures logging with a NullHandler, defines a version string, and specifies exported symbols. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or execute external commands. The version string is a placeholder ('0.12'), which is standard practice. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals point to a safe, standard configuration module. The scores are consistent with this assessment.",
