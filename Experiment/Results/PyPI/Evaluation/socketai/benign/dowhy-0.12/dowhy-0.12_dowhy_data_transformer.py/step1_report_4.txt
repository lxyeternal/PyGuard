{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for reducing the dimensionality of data, likely used in data processing or machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'data_array' in the constructor; potentially data passed during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'data_array' into the '_data' attribute; no further flow since 'reduce' method is unimplemented.",
  "anomalies": "The 'reduce' method raises NotImplementedError, indicating incomplete implementation but not suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The class is a straightforward, minimal implementation intended for subclassing or future extension. It does not contain any code executing untrusted input, network operations, or malicious actions. The constructor stores provided data; no processing or malicious behavior observed. The 'reduce' method is unimplemented, serving as a placeholder. Overall, the code appears safe and standard for a data processing class template.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class template for dimensionality reduction, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious flows, or suspicious logic. It is likely part of a larger system that implements actual reduction algorithms elsewhere.",
