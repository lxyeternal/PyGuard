{
  "purpose": "Define a class for reducing the dimensionality of data arrays, likely for data preprocessing or feature extraction.",
  "sources": "Data is provided via the constructor argument 'data_array'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs; the 'reduce' method is intended for implementation but currently raises an error.",
  "flows": "Input data is stored in an instance variable; the reduction process would occur in 'reduce' (not implemented).",
  "anomalies": "The class is incomplete; the 'reduce' method is not implemented, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an initializer that stores input data and a parameter for target dimensions. The 'reduce' method is meant to be overridden in subclasses or implemented later, but currently raises NotImplementedError. There are no external data flows, no suspicious logic, no dynamic code execution, and no indication of malicious intent. The structure suggests an incomplete stub for data processing without malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward class definition intended for future implementation of a dimensionality reduction algorithm. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. The only notable aspect is its incomplete state, which is typical for abstract or base classes.",
