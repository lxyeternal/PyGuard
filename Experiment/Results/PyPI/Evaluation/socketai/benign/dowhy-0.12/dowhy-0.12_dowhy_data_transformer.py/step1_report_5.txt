{
  "purpose": "Define a class for reducing the dimensionality of data, likely as part of a data processing or machine learning pipeline.",
  "sources": "Initialization method (__init__) where it reads input parameter 'data_array' and optional keyword arguments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are evident; the code does not perform any data output, network communication, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Data is assigned to an instance variable (_data), but there are no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources beyond initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The class is incomplete, with an unimplemented 'reduce' method.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class intended for dimensionality reduction, initializing with data and number of dimensions. The 'reduce' method is a placeholder and raises NotImplementedError, indicating the class is incomplete or abstract. No malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious operations are observed. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or insecure operations. It appears to be a straightforward class definition without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple class skeleton for dimensionality reduction with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations. The code is incomplete but safe in its current form.",
