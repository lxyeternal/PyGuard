{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for reducing the dimensionality of data, likely as part of a larger data processing or machine learning pipeline.",
  "sources": "Data input through the constructor parameter 'data_array'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output mechanisms are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'data_array' into the class instance; no further data flows are observable here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes with input data and desired number of dimensions; it includes an unimplemented method 'reduce' which suggests intended future functionality. No data manipulation, external calls, or potentially malicious code are present. The code appears to be a standard class skeleton for a dimensionality reduction module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign class definition for a data reduction utility. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
