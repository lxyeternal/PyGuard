  "purpose": "A base class skeleton for dimensionality reduction, intended for extension.",
  "sources": "Input data array (_data), target dimensions (_ndims), optional kwargs.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data leaks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Data is stored in _data; no processing or flow to external sinks occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The 'reduce' method raises NotImplementedError, indicating incomplete implementation but not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal class with an initializer storing input data and an unimplemented method. No external calls, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The incomplete 'reduce' method is typical for base classes. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected. The security risk is minimal, justified by the incomplete but benign nature of the class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, incomplete class skeleton with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The small security risk scores in some reports are appropriate given the incomplete state but do not indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the code is safe and straightforward.",
