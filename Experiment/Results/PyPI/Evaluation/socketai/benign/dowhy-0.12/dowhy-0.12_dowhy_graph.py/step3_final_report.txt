{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for constructing, parsing, validating, and manipulating causal graphs, primarily using networkx and related libraries.",
  "sources": "File reading operations for graph input files, dynamic imports of visualization libraries (pygraphviz, pydot), and external graph parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data into system effects; however, dynamic imports and file reading could be exploited if malicious files are provided or environment is compromised.",
  "flows": "Input files or strings -> parsing functions -> graph construction or modification -> validation functions; no untrusted data flows into system commands or network activities.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external file reading and dynamic imports of visualization libraries (pygraphviz, pydot), which could be exploited if files are malicious or environment is compromised, but no malicious code present in the module itself.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for causal graph handling, with functions for building, parsing, validating, and manipulating graphs. It uses well-known libraries and standard practices. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. External file operations and dynamic imports are potential attack vectors if inputs are malicious, but the code does not execute untrusted code directly. The overall structure and content suggest a safe utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility for causal graph management with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal risks associated with external file handling and dynamic imports are typical for such tools and do not constitute active threats. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting the potential attack surface but no active malicious behavior.",
