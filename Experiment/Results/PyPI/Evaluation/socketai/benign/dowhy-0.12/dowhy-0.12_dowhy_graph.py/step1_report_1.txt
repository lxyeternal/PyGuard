  "purpose": "This module defines interfaces and functions for constructing, validating, and analyzing causal graphs using networkx, supporting various formats and operations typical in causal inference workflows.",
  "sources": "User inputs in the form of graph strings or file paths, data from networkx graph attributes, and input parameters to functions (e.g., node lists, file paths).",
  "sinks": "File reading operations, logging outputs, networkx graph manipulations, and potential use of external libraries (pygraphviz, pydot) for graph parsing.",
  "flows": "Input graph strings or file paths → parsing functions determine format and load graph → graph construction functions modify or analyze graphs → potential external library calls for graph reading.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. The code relies on standard libraries and well-known external graph libraries without obfuscation. No suspicious dynamic execution or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation for handling causal graphs with functions for validation, manipulation, and format parsing. It includes file I/O operations, format conversions, and external library calls for graph reading (pygraphviz, pydot). No suspicious code patterns, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors, are present. The external library usage is standard for graph processing tasks. No signs of malicious intent, such as network communication, credential handling, or data leakage, are detected. The functions perform expected operations with standard safety checks and error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation for causal graph handling and format parsing. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious logic. The usage of external libraries for graph parsing is common in such contexts and does not suggest sabotage or malware. Overall, the code is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
