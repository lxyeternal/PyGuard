  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility for causal graph management with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal risks associated with external file handling and dynamic imports are typical for such tools and do not constitute active threats. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting the potential attack surface but no active malicious behavior."
