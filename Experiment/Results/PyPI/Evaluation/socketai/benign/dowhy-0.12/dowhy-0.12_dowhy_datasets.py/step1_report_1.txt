{
  "purpose": "The code generates synthetic datasets for causal inference and statistical analysis, including data simulation for treatment effects, instrumental variables, and real-world datasets like Lalonde and PSID.",
  "sources": "Input data is generated internally via random number generators, multivariate normal distributions, and functions like np.random and scipy.stats; no external untrusted data sources are read during execution.",
  "sinks": "Data is stored in pandas DataFrames; no data is transmitted over the network, written to files, or sent to external servers; no untrusted input is processed in a manner that could lead to injection or leakage.",
  "flows": "Random seed initialization influences data generation; synthetic data is created through internal probabilistic models; no external or untrusted data flows into or out of the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive use of random number generators for data creation but no unusual or suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are present. All data creation methods are standard for synthetic data generation. No signs of obfuscation, hidden logic, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed solely for synthetic data generation, with functions creating datasets for causal inference, simulation, and analysis. It uses common libraries like numpy, scipy, pandas, networkx, and scikit-learn, all for legitimate purposes. No network operations, file writing, or external input handling is present. The randomness is confined to data simulation, which is typical in dataset generation routines. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or stealthy operations. The functions are well-structured for generating various datasets, including from real data sources, with no suspicious code segments or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive dataset generator intended for causal inference experiments and educational purposes. It employs standard, legitimate data synthesis techniques without any malicious intent or harmful behavior. No evidence of malware, sabotage, or malicious activity is found.",
