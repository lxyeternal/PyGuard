{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate synthetic datasets for causal inference research, including linear, instrumental variable, partially linear, and real-world datasets like Lalonde, PSID, and sales data.",
  "sources": "Data generation functions produce datasets via numpy and pandas; user input parameters for dataset customization; external datasets loaded via URLs.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that send untrusted data outside the process; data outputs are stored in pandas DataFrames; no network transmission or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data generation flows from parameters through numpy operations to DataFrame outputs; synthetic data constructs follow linear models, multivariate normals, and random graph-based processes; no flow leads to external data leaks or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. Usage of external data sources appears standard. No obfuscated or misleading code features present.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs synthetic datasets using standard scientific libraries, with functions for data simulation, graph creation, and dataset assembly. No code executes external commands, network requests, or malicious actions. All operations are confined to data creation and transformation. The inclusion of dataset download functions from public repositories is typical for dataset loading and does not pose security risks. There are no indications of malware or sabotage. The code adheres to normal data science practices, with clear, documented functions for dataset generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and intended solely for dataset creation for research purposes. No malicious behavior, security risks, or sabotage mechanisms are present. The dataset loading functions use standard, publicly available URLs, and data generation processes are straightforward and well-documented.",
