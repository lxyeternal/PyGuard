{
  "purpose": "The code generates synthetic datasets for causal inference research, including functions for data simulation, graph creation, and loading public datasets. It employs standard scientific libraries and does not perform any external system calls or network activity during execution.",
  "sources": "Internal probabilistic models, numpy/scipy functions, and external datasets loaded via public URLs (e.g., Lalonde, PSID). No untrusted input sources or network communication during runtime.",
  "sinks": "Data is stored in pandas DataFrames; no data leaves the system or is transmitted externally. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows are confined within the process: data is generated or loaded, processed internally, and stored locally. No external data transmission occurs after initial dataset loading.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. The code structure is standard for scientific data generation.",
  "analysis": "The code employs common scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, pandas, networkx, sklearn) for data simulation and graph visualization. External datasets are loaded from public URLs, which are standard in research contexts. No network activity or external communication occurs during execution. The functions are well-documented and serve typical purposes in causal inference research. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, research-oriented data generation and visualization toolkit. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
