  "purpose": "Configure URL routing for the django_select2 package, specifically setting up an endpoint for AutoResponseView.",
  "sources": "Import statements for django.urls.path, django.views, and local views; URL pattern definition.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; straightforward URL configuration with no data flow or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard Django URL routing setup without obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines an app namespace, and sets a URL pattern for an API endpoint. No hardcoded secrets, external data processing, or malicious behaviors are evident. The view AutoResponseView is imported but not inspected; however, based solely on this URL configuration, it appears to serve as an endpoint returning JSON data. The code follows standard Django practices with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django URL configuration for django_select2, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks based on this fragment.",
