{
  "purpose": "The code sets up URL routing for the django_select2 package, registering an endpoint for auto JSON responses.",
  "sources": "The URL pattern 'fields/auto.json' that points to AutoResponseView.as_view()",
  "funnels": "User request to 'fields/auto.json' triggers the AutoResponseView; the view may handle data processing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs observed; no evidence of obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django URL utilities and a specific view, then registers a single URL pattern for a JSON endpoint used by django_select2. The code appears to be standard URL configuration with no external or untrusted data handling evident. The view AutoResponseView is imported from local views; without its implementation, we cannot assess its internal security, but the URL configuration itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Django URL configuration for the django_select2 package, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It primarily registers an endpoint for auto-complete JSON responses. The risk is minimal, assuming the view implementation is secure.",
