  "purpose": "Configure URL routing for django_select2 integration in a Django project, specifically for an auto-response view endpoint.",
  "sources": "Import statements for django.urls and local views; URL pattern definitions.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or output used in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; URL pattern is static, and view handling is external.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Django modules and a local view, defines a URL pattern for an auto-response endpoint, and registers it under a specific app namespace. It appears standard for Django URL configuration without any dynamic or malicious behavior. No input handling or untrusted data sources are evident, nor are there suspicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward URL configuration module for Django with no malicious or suspicious code detected. It simply maps a URL to a view for auto-response functionality, which is typical for Django apps.",
