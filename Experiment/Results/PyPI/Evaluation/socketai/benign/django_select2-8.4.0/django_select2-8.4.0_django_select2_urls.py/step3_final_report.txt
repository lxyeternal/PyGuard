{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Django URL configuration for the django_select2 package, mapping a specific JSON endpoint to a view.",
  "sources": "The code reads static URL patterns and imports a view class from local views.",
  "sinks": "The URL pattern directs requests to AutoResponseView.as_view(), which could process untrusted data if internally insecure, but the URL config itself does not handle data directly.",
  "flows": "Requests to 'fields/auto.json' are routed to AutoResponseView; no data flows are evident in this configuration alone.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django URL routing setup with standard practices. It imports necessary modules, defines an app namespace, and maps a URL to a class-based view. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws are apparent. The view's internal implementation is unknown, but the URL configuration itself is benign. The reports correctly identify the lack of malicious indicators, assign a malware score of 0, and low security risk scores, with high confidence. No issues or suspicious behaviors are detected in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The URL configuration is standard, safe, and poses no security risks. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and low risk are justified and consistent with the code. The overall assessment is that this code is benign and correctly implemented.",
  "confidence": 1,
