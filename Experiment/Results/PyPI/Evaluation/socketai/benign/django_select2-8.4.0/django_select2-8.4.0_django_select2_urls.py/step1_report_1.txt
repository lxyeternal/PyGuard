  "purpose": "Configure URL routing for django_select2, specifically adding a route for auto JSON responses.",
  "sources": "Reading URL configuration, importing views, defining URL patterns.",
  "sinks": "Invoking AutoResponseView.as_view() which handles HTTP requests and generates responses.",
  "flows": "HTTP request to 'fields/auto.json' triggers AutoResponseView, which processes the request and responds.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. Use of standard Django URL configuration and class-based views.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines an app namespace, and sets a URL pattern linking a specific endpoint to a view. No malicious code, backdoors, or unusual behavior present. The view is a standard Django class-based view, presumably serving JSON data. No untrusted data processing is visible here, and no external or malicious code is executed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward URL configuration for a Django app, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply maps a URL to a view for JSON responses. Overall, safe and typical for Django projects.",
