{
  "purpose": "Defines URL configuration for django_select2, specifically adding a route for an AutoResponseView.",
  "sources": "The code reads the URL configuration and imports the AutoResponseView class.",
  "sinks": "The view AutoResponseView may process incoming HTTP requests; URL patterns are used by the Django framework.",
  "flows": "HTTP requests to 'fields/auto.json' are routed to AutoResponseView.as_view() for processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The URL pattern and view import appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a URL pattern for a view. It includes standard Django URL configuration patterns. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The AutoResponseView is a class-based view; without its implementation, no assessment of its internal behavior is possible, but the configuration itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django URL configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply maps a URL to a view, which is typical for Django projects.",
