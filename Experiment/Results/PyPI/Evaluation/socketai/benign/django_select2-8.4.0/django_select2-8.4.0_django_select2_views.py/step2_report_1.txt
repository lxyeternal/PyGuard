  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code handles AJAX requests, reading 'term', 'field_id', and dependent fields, retrieving widget data from cache using signed 'field_id'.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; uses signing.loads on 'field_id' and cache retrieval, then instantiates widget classes dynamically.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The report notes that signing provides integrity, and no suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The dynamic import is controlled via cache data, not user input directly, reducing risk.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is that the code is standard, secure, with no malicious behavior. The confidence score of 0.9 is reasonable.\n\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are low (0.2 and 0), aligning with the assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar flow, focusing on cache retrieval with signed 'field_id'.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Highlights potential risk if cache is compromised, as malicious cache content could instantiate malicious widgets.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Proper use of signing mitigates tampering, but reliance on cache integrity is critical. No malicious code detected, but the risk exists if cache is malicious.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report correctly notes that risks are minimized with proper cache management and signature validation. The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is justified, considering the potential if cache is compromised.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar flow, with emphasis on dynamic import and cache.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Valid; dynamic import via 'import_string' could be risky if cache data is malicious, but signature validation helps.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity. The main concern is cache integrity and dynamic class loading.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately low risk, no malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Consistent; malware at 0, risk at 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar; emphasizes the use of signing and cache.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; proper validation and error handling are in place.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or backdoors; reliance on cache integrity is standard.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is that the code is secure, with proper validation.\n\n- **Scores:** Appropriate; malware at 0, risk at 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar flow, with emphasis on dynamic class loading via 'import_string'.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Valid; the dynamic import could be risky if cache or settings are compromised, but signature validation mitigates this.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or backdoors. The main concern is cache integrity and the safety of dynamic class loading.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is accurate; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Appropriate; malware at 0, risk at 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 across reports reflects minor potential risks mainly associated with cache integrity and dynamic class loading, which are mitigated by signature validation.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no signs of malicious behavior or malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — low, given proper cache management and signature validation; potential risks are standard and mitigated.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears secure, with no supply chain or malicious concerns. The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's logic and security measures.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Maintain vigilance over cache integrity and signature validation in deployment, but the code itself is sound.",
