{
  "purpose": "Handles AJAX requests for heavy model widgets, retrieving widget data from cache validated via signed 'field_id', and dynamically instantiating widget classes to generate JSON responses.",
  "sources": "Request parameters ('term', 'field_id', dependent fields), cache storage containing widget configuration, signed 'field_id' for integrity verification.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import of widget class via 'import_string', instantiation of widget with cache data, method calls on widget instances, JSON response generation.",
  "flows": "Request parameters and cache data flow into widget instantiation; 'signing.loads' verifies 'field_id'; cache data provides class info and queryset; dynamic import loads widget class; widget methods generate results for JSON.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'signing.loads' for 'field_id' is standard; dynamic import via 'import_string' is controlled by cache data, not user input directly; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity; reliance on cache integrity and signature validation is critical but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Django security practices, including signature validation to prevent tampering with 'field_id'. The dynamic class loading is based on cache data validated by signature, reducing risk. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The main potential risk lies in cache integrity; if cache is compromised, malicious widget classes could be loaded. However, signature validation mitigates this risk. Error handling is appropriate, and no insecure patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is secure and well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The use of signing and cache validation aligns with best practices. The low risk score (0.2) accurately reflects the potential, mitigated risks associated with cache integrity and dynamic import. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, indicating no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
