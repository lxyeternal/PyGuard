  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code uses Django's signing module to verify 'field_id' parameters, which is a good practice.\n- Widget data is retrieved from cache, then used to instantiate widget classes dynamically via import_string.\n- The code appears straightforward, with proper error handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are evident.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or direct malicious code is present.\n- The main concern is cache integrity and the safety of dynamic class loading.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose & flow:**  \nStandard Django view for heavy model widgets, with signature validation and cache retrieval.\n\n**Analysis & conclusion:**  \n- No malicious behavior or supply chain issues are detected.\n- Proper validation with signing and cache is in place.\n- **Risk score: 0.2** seems reasonable.\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- No malware detected; consistent with the report.\n\n**Score adjustment:**  \n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose & flow:**  \nFocuses on potential risks if cache or signatures are compromised, especially with dynamic widget instantiation.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- The report correctly notes that malicious cache content could lead to instantiation of malicious widgets.\n- The signature validation mitigates some risks, but if cache is compromised, malicious widget classes could be loaded.\n- No evidence of actual malicious code, just a potential risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- The risk is theoretical but plausible if cache integrity is broken.\n- The report assigns a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Score adjustment:**  \n- The overall risk score of 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose & flow:**  \nSimilar to previous reports, emphasizing reliance on cache and signing.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- No malicious code detected.\n- The code uses standard practices.\n- The main concern is cache integrity, which is acknowledged.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- The risk is low, consistent with the 0.2 score.\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- Correctly assigned as 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose & flow:**  \nHighlights dynamic import and cache reliance.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- The use of import_string with class info from cache is standard but could be risky if cache is maliciously manipulated.\n- Signature validation reduces risk.\n- No malicious code or backdoors.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- The risk is minimal, and malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose & flow:**  \nFocuses on the potential danger of dynamic class loading and cache manipulation.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- The report correctly identifies that if cache data is maliciously crafted, it could lead to loading malicious widget classes.\n- Signature validation helps, but cache integrity remains critical.\n- No evidence of actual malicious code.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- Overall, the code is safe under proper cache and signature security.\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code analysis. No evidence of malicious behavior or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** 0.2 across all reports, reflecting a low but present concern about cache integrity and dynamic class loading.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — primarily due to reliance on cache integrity and dynamic import, which are standard but require proper security measures.\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe code is well-structured, uses standard Django practices, and the risks are well-understood and mitigated by signature validation. No signs of malicious activity or supply chain issues are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code appears secure within its operational context, with no malicious or obfuscated components. The minor risks are typical for dynamic class loading and cache reliance, which are mitigated by signature validation. The scores given are appropriate, and I concur with them.",
