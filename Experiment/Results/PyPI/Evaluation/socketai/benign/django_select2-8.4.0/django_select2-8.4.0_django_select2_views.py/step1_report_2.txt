  "purpose": "Handle AJAX requests for loading model widget options asynchronously in a Django application.",
  "sources": "Request parameters such as 'term', 'field_id', and dependent field values; cache data retrieved using signed 'field_id'.",
  "sinks": "None directly in the code; potential risk if cache contains malicious widget data or if 'field_id' is tampered with.",
  "flows": "Request GET parameters -> get_widget_or_404() via 'field_id' -> cache retrieval -> dynamic widget instantiation and method calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of signing and cache to retrieve widget data, which could be manipulated if cache or signatures are compromised. The dynamic instantiation of widgets with data from cache could lead to execution of malicious widget classes if the cache is compromised or maliciously crafted.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves widget data from cache using a signed 'field_id' to prevent tampering, which is a security best practice. However, the cache content ('widget_dict') is directly used to instantiate a widget class ('widget_cls') with parameters from cache, which could be malicious if cache data is compromised. No direct code injection, network calls, or data leaks are evident in this snippet. The signature validation and cache lookup mitigate many risks, but reliance on cache integrity is critical. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or backdoors is present. Overall, the code appears standard with some risk if cache integrity is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code securely retrieves widget data using signed identifiers and cache validation. No malicious behavior or malware is evident in this snippet. The main security concern lies in ensuring cache integrity, as malicious cache content could lead to instantiation of malicious widgets, but with proper cache management and signature validation, risks are minimized.",
