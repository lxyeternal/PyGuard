  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk, and cross-checking the code content.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a Django configuration class (`Select2Conf`) with static attributes defining paths for JS, CSS, internationalization, cache settings, and JSON encoder.\n- There is no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data processing.\n- The code consists mainly of class attributes, constants, and descriptive comments.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The URLs for assets are either default or configurable, with guidance on local hosting.\n- The overall structure and content are typical for a Django app configuration module.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Malware and Obfuscation**\n\n- **Presence of malware?**  \n  No. The code is static configuration with no suspicious or malicious logic.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated strings or code patterns.\n\n### **2. Security Risks**\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  None. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n\n- **Configuration issues?**  \n  The only concern could be if asset URLs are externally hosted and compromised, but defaults point to local static files or configurable options.\n\n### **3. Scores Justification**\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  **0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  **0** — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  **0** — No security vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n### **4. Any discrepancies or unreasonable scores?**\n\n- The reports uniformly assign **0** to malware, obfuscated, and risk scores, which is consistent with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|---------------|\n| 0         | 0            | 0             |\n\nThe code is a standard configuration class with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **The code is benign.**  \n- **No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.**  \n- **Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code content.**\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis or specific concerns are needed.",
