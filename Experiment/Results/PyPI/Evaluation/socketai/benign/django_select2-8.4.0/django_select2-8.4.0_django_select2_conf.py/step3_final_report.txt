  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; purely static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django configuration class with static attributes and descriptive comments. It contains no dynamic code, user input handling, network operations, or data processing. The URLs and paths are either defaults or configurable, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The code's purpose is purely to define configuration parameters, which are safe and standard for such modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module for Django-Select2 with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
