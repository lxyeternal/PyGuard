  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is static configuration, no dynamic or untrusted data.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No. The reasoning is sound; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores?** Malware and risk scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Justification for scores > 0.5?** Not applicable; all scores are 0.\n- **Malware?** Confirmed as 0.\n- **Assumptions?** No unwarranted assumptions; the report correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n**Conclusion:** The first report's assessment appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues present?** No. Static configuration with no dynamic or untrusted data.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores?** Malware and risk scores are 0, matching the benign nature.\n- **Malware?** Correctly scored as 0.\n- **Assumptions?** None unjustified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The second report's assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues present?** No. Static attribute assignments.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No. The analysis correctly notes the absence of malicious code.\n- **Scores?** Malware and risk scores are 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Malware?** Correctly 0.\n- **Assumptions?** No unwarranted assumptions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The third report's evaluation is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues present?** No. Static configuration.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores?** Malware and risk scores are 0, matching the benign analysis.\n- **Malware?** Correctly 0.\n- **Assumptions?** No.\n\n**Conclusion:** The fourth report's assessment seems correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues present?** No. Static configuration data.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores?** Malware and risk scores are 0, aligned with the code.\n- **Malware?** Correctly 0.\n- **Assumptions?** None unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static configuration for Django-Select2.\n- No dynamic code, user input handling, or external data processing is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors.\n- The code's purpose is purely to define configuration parameters, which are safe.\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. Based on the provided code and analysis, I agree with their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, well-documented configuration class for Django-Select2, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
