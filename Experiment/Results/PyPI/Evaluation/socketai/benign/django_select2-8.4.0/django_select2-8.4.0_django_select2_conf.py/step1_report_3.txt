{
  "purpose": "The code provides configuration settings for the Django-Select2 library, including cache, static assets, themes, internationalization, and JSON encoding.",
  "sources": "Static asset lists (JS and CSS), environment variables for cache and static paths, and configuration attributes within the Select2Conf class.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the configuration attributes that influence the loading of JS/CSS files, cache backend, and JSON encoder, which could affect application behavior but do not directly lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Configuration attributes flow from settings into the application's runtime behavior, influencing cache, static assets, and translation files loading.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. All code consists of class definitions, attribute assignments, and documentation comments. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data processing present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django configuration class for the Django-Select2 package. It primarily sets static lists of URLs for JS and CSS assets, cache backend settings, and internationalization paths. The attributes are straightforward and well-documented, with no signs of malicious logic. There is no dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no external data processing that could be exploited. The code does not contain obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The use of class attributes to store configuration data poses no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup for Django-Select2 with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily defines static configuration options without any dynamic or unsafe code. Overall, it appears to be safe and standard for its purpose.",
