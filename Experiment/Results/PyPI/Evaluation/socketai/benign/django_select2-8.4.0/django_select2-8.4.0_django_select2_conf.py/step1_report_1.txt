  "purpose": "Configuration settings for the Django-Select2 package to customize its behavior and appearance within a Django project.",
  "sources": "Constants and class attributes providing configuration data, such as JS/CSS file paths, cache settings, and translation paths.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; static configuration data is used throughout.",
  "flows": "Configuration values are assigned directly; no dynamic or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior observed. The code is primarily static configuration with descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django configuration class with static attributes for JS/CSS paths, cache settings, internationalization paths, and JSON encoding. It does not process user input, execute dynamic code, or handle untrusted data sources. The only notable points are configuration options for serving static assets locally or remotely, which are standard for such packages. There is no evidence of malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration module for Django-Select2 with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It provides customizable settings for static assets, caching, and internationalization, all of which are typical in such configuration classes.",
