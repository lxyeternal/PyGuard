{
  "purpose": "Configuration settings for Django-Select2 integration, including cache, assets, theme, and internationalization options.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from class attributes, hardcoded strings, and imported modules such as 'appconf' and 'django.conf'. No user input or external data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to data leaks or execution. The code primarily defines static configuration values.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only assigns static values and documentation strings.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive documentation, but no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or potential backdoors are present. No dynamic execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward configuration class for the Django-Select2 package, with no evidence of malicious behavior. It defines static attributes for cache, assets, theme, internationalization, and JSON encoding. All settings are configurable and well-documented, with no indication of malicious intent or data exfiltration. It does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration module for a Django package, with no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe and intended for setting up Django-Select2 features.",
