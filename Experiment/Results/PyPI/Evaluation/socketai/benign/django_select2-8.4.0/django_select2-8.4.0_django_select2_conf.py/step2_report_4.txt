  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: code presence, logic flaws, score appropriateness, and potential malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is static configuration for Django-Select2, with no dynamic or untrusted data processing. No suspicious code or malware detected.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0 is appropriate; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Potential issues:** None identified; the code is straightforward configuration.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment is accurate. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, static configuration with no dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0 is appropriate.\n- **Potential issues:** None observed; the code is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Static attributes configuring assets, cache, and internationalization. No untrusted data or dynamic code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0 is correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Potential issues:** None; the code is standard configuration.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, a static configuration class with no dynamic or untrusted data. No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0 is correct.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above—static configuration, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0 is justified.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the static, readable code.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**My own estimate:** Based on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is purely configuration, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, standard configuration for Django-Select2, and warrants no security concern.",
