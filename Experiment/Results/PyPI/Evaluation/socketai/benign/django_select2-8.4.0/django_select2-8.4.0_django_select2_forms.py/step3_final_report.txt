{
  "purpose": "The code provides Django form widgets for integrating Select2 JavaScript library, supporting features like AJAX loading, tagging, and model-based choices, to enhance form selection fields.",
  "sources": "Standard Django form fields, choices, URL reversing, cache storage, and media assets.",
  "sinks": "HTML attributes for select elements, cache entries storing widget state, URL endpoints for AJAX, media files for widget scripts and styles.",
  "flows": "User input triggers AJAX requests; widget attributes are built dynamically; widget state is cached; URL reversals generate endpoints; data flows from user to server and back.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'pickle' with 'nosec' comment for cache serialization is standard in Django; no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Django form widgets with dynamic attributes, AJAX support, and caching. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. Cache storage involves pickling widget objects, which is typical, and no obfuscation or malicious imports are found. The creation of model instances in 'value_from_datadict' for tagging is expected functionality, not malicious. Overall, the code adheres to standard practices and is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured set of Django widgets for Select2 integration, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or high security risk. The minor risk score reflects typical cache serialization practices but does not indicate any threat.",
