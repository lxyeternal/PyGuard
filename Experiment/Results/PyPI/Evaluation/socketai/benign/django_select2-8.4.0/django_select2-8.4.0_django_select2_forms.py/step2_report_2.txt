  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is standard Django widget code with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None identified; reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 seem reasonable given the code's nature. The risk score is low, reflecting standard widget behavior.\n- **Justification for scores?** The only concern is the potential for misuse of `value_from_datadict` to create new model instances, which could be exploited if misused, but this is inherent to the widget's functionality, not malicious.\n- **Overall:** No malicious intent or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code employs standard Django practices.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None; reasoning aligns with typical widget implementation.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No network activity, no dynamic code execution, just cache storage with pickling (not malicious by itself).\n- **Overall:** Safe, standard code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is typical for such widgets.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None evident.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** Usage of cache with pickling is standard; no malicious payloads.\n- **Overall:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code follows standard practices.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Cache storage, URL reversal, and media inclusion are typical; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Overall:** Safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is legitimate.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 are suitable.\n- **Justification:** Uses standard Django mechanisms, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Overall:** Secure.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher (around 0.1-0.2) due to cache serialization and dynamic URL generation, but these are standard practices. No significant security risks are evident.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, inherent to dynamic widget behavior, but within safe bounds)\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a well-structured, standard implementation of Django form widgets for Select2 integration, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The potential for misuse in creating new model instances via `value_from_datadict` is a known feature and not malicious per se, but should be used carefully in production environments.",
