  "purpose": "This code provides various Django form widgets and mixins for implementing Select2 dropdowns with AJAX, tagging, and model integration features in Django projects.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from form submissions, URL parameters, and form field values; retrieves queryset and model information for choices; uses cache for storing widget state; accesses URL patterns and settings.",
  "sinks": "Uses reverse() to generate URLs; stores widget state in cache; interacts with form data; dynamically constructs HTML attributes for frontend behavior.",
  "flows": "Source: form data, URL parameters, model/queryset data -> sink: URL generation, cache storage, HTML attribute rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of cache.set() with picklable objects is standard; no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The code constructs dynamic attributes and caches widget states securely. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Django widgets and mixins for Select2 functionality, including AJAX-based and model-based options. It relies on standard Django mechanisms like URL reversing, caching, and form rendering. There are no signs of malicious code such as network data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful logic. The use of cache.set() is cautious and appropriate, with error handling for serialization issues. The import statements and logic are typical for form widget implementations, and no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of advanced Django form widgets for enhanced dropdown features with no detected malicious or sabotage behaviors. It follows standard practices for form rendering, AJAX integration, and caching. Overall, it appears secure and intended solely for frontend widget functionality.",
