{
  "purpose": "Configure and provide access to a specified Django cache backend for sharing data across machines and threads, particularly for Select2 functionality.",
  "sources": "Reading the cache backend setting from 'settings.SELECT2_CACHE_BACKEND'. Accessing 'caches' dictionary from 'django.core.cache'.",
  "sinks": "The 'cache' object obtained from 'caches', used to store or retrieve data; no direct data sink involving untrusted input is apparent.",
  "flows": "The code reads configuration from 'settings', then uses that to index into 'caches' to assign a cache instance to 'cache'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's cache system, reads a cache backend name from project settings, and assigns the corresponding cache object to a module-level variable. This setup facilitates shared caching, which is standard in Django applications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden code, or obfuscated logic. Usage appears legitimate, with guidance on best practices (using a dedicated cache server).",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration snippet for setting up Django cache based on user settings. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The code is simple, transparent, and aligns with typical Django practices.",
