  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django cache setup for Select2, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only potential risk stems from external configuration management, which is typical and manageable. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero. The confidence in this assessment is high."
