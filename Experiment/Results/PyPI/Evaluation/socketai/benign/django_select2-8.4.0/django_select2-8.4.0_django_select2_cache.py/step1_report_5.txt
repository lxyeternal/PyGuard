{
  "purpose": "Configure and provide access to a cache backend for sharing data across multiple machines or threads, specifically for the Select2 component in a Django project.",
  "sources": "Reading the setting 'SELECT2_CACHE_BACKEND' from the 'settings' module to determine which cache backend to use.",
  "targets": "Accessing 'caches' from django.core.cache to retrieve the specified cache backend.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves the cache backend specified in settings and assigns it to the variable 'cache'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code relies on external configuration via 'settings', which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's caching framework and a local 'settings' module to determine which cache backend to use. It then exposes a single object, 'cache', which is a reference to the specified cache. There are no hardcoded credentials, no data leaks, and no suspicious behaviors. The code's purpose is straightforward configuration management without any dynamic code execution or data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured configuration snippet for a Django project, intended to set up a cache for sharing data in Select2. It contains no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
