{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "The code assigns version strings and tuples directly within the source.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input sources; no data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Direct assignment of version variables without external data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code declares version-related variables and assigns static version data. It includes type-checking conditions but does not execute any input/output, network, or sensitive operations. There are no hardcoded credentials, no malicious code, and no unusual behavior. The structure is standard for version metadata in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version information declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
