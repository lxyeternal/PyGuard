{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, to be used for package versioning and compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and version tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; simple variable assignments.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only assigns static values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code contains straightforward variable definitions and assignments with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple) with static, hardcoded values. It includes a conditional import based on TYPE_CHECKING, which is a standard pattern for type hints without runtime impact. No external inputs, untrusted data, or dangerous operations are present. The code is minimal and standard for version management in Python projects. It is generated by a tool (setuptools-scm) and contains no malicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version info module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
