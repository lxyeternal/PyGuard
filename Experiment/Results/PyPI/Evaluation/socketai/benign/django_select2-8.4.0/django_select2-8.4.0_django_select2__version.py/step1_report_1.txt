{
  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings (__version__ and version)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious patterns; conditional type hinting appears standard",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables, including __version__, version, and version_tuple, with hardcoded values. The conditional import for TYPE_CHECKING is a common pattern for type hints and does not introduce security concerns. No external input or dynamic code execution is present. The code's purpose is purely to define package version info, and it does not perform any data processing or I/O operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, standard for version definition, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
