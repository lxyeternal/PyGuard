  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Defines version info, generated by setuptools-scm.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Static assignments, no external input or data flow.  \n- Anomalies: No unusual patterns, standard conditional type hinting.  \n- Analysis: The code is straightforward, assigning static version info, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.  \n- Conclusion: Benign, standard version declaration.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Static data, no external input.  \n- Anomalies: No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.  \n- Analysis: Standard version info code, no malicious behavior.  \n- Conclusion: Benign.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Static assignments.  \n- Anomalies: No anomalies or obfuscation.  \n- Analysis: Standard version declaration, generated by setuptools-scm, no malicious intent.  \n- Conclusion: Safe.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Version info, generated by setuptools-scm.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Static values only.  \n- Anomalies: Standard pattern, no obfuscation or suspicious code.  \n- Analysis: Straightforward, with no dynamic code or malicious behavior.  \n- Conclusion: Benign.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Version info, generated by setuptools-scm.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Static assignments, no external data.  \n- Anomalies: Use of TYPE_CHECKING is standard; no obfuscation or secrets.  \n- Analysis: Typical pattern for type hints, no malicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: Safe.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**  \n- The code in question is a standard, auto-generated version declaration module.  \n- No dynamic code, external input, or suspicious patterns are present.  \n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.  \n- There are no claims or indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final Justification:**  \n- The malware score remains at 0 because there is no malicious activity, code injection, or hidden behavior.  \n- The obfuscated score remains at 0 because the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- The risk score remains at 0, as the code does not pose any security threat.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- risk: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed assessments and the nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
