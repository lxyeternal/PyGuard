  "purpose": "Defines version information for the package using static assignment, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and type checking conditional block.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; static values only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of type checking conditional block is standard and does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version-related variables using static values and type hints. The 'TYPE_CHECKING' block is a standard pattern to aid static analysis without affecting runtime behavior. The code does not perform any data input, network operations, or system modifications. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard version information declaration with no malicious intent or security risks.",
