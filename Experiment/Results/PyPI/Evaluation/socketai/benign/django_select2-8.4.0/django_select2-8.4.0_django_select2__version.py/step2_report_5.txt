  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward version declaration with no external input, dynamic code, or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, standard version info code with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard static assignment of version info with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—standard version info, no dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with others; static version info with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely for version declaration, generated by a well-known tool (setuptools-scm).\n- No external inputs, no code execution, no network activity, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- The risk score of 0 and malware score of 0 are justified.\n- The confidence level of 1 is appropriate.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, benign, and standard for its purpose.",
