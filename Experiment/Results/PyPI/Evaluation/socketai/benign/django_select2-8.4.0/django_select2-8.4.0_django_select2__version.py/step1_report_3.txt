  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, providing version strings and tuples for package management and compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "The code sources version information from hardcoded string and tuple assignments.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "The flow is from hardcoded version data to variable assignments; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no unusual patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple version declaration module generated by setuptools-scm. It assigns static version strings and tuples, with no external data input, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive information handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The structure and content are consistent with standard version management files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration file with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply assigns static version information for package management purposes.",
