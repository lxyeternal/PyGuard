  "purpose": "Defines version information for the package, generated by setuptools-scm, with static version strings and tuples.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and tuples assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static assignments only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static data used solely for version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern with conditional type checking, no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static version declaration module with no dynamic code, external data, or malicious behavior. It uses standard Python constructs and is generated by a common tool. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent are present. The code's purpose is purely declarative, and it poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of security concerns. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's static and straightforward structure.",
