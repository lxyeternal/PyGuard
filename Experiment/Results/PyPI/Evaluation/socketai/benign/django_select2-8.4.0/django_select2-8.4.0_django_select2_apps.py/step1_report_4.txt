  "purpose": "Django application configuration for 'django_select2' package.",
  "sources": "Import statement within the 'ready' method: 'from . import conf'.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'conf' module in the 'ready' method.",
  "flows": "Importing 'conf' module during application startup, which may execute code in 'conf'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a local import within the 'ready' method is typical in Django apps; no suspicious or unusual code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with a 'ready' method that imports a local module 'conf'. This pattern is common for initializing configurations when the app is ready. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or malicious code are present. The import occurs during app startup, which is standard behavior and does not imply malicious intent. The 'conf' module could contain configurations, but its content is not shown here. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django app configuration module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up the application configuration and imports a local module during startup.",
