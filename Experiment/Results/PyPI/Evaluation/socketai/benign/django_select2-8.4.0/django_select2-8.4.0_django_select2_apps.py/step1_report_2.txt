  "purpose": "Configure Django application settings for the 'django_select2' package.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'conf' module inside the 'ready' method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The 'ready' method imports a local module, which is standard in Django app configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with a 'ready' method that imports a local configuration module. This pattern is typical for Django apps to initialize configurations or signal handlers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data handling. The import within 'ready' is standard for delayed imports or initial setup. No external network activity, credential handling, or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django application configuration class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
