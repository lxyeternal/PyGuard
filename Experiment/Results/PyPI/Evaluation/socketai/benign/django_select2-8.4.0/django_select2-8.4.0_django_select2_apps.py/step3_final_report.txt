  "purpose": "Configure a Django application by defining an AppConfig subclass and importing a local configuration module during startup.",
  "sources": "Class definition, setting 'name' and 'verbose_name', import statement within 'ready()' method.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network activity, or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Import of '.conf' module during app startup via 'ready()' method.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard Django pattern; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django AppConfig subclass with a 'ready()' method importing a local module. This pattern is common for initializing signals or configurations. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The import occurs during startup, which is typical. No data leaks, network calls, or suspicious behavior are present. The minimal security concern regarding the import is justified as standard practice, and no evidence suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard Django configuration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The import pattern is typical and not suspicious. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
