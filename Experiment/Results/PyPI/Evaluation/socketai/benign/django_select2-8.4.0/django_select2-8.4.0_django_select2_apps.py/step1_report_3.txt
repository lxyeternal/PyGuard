  "purpose": "Define Django application configuration for the 'django_select2' package.",
  "sources": "Import statement for the 'conf' module within the 'ready' method.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data sinks, network calls, or data output points present.",
  "flows": "The 'ready' method imports the local 'conf' module when called, but does not execute or process any data beyond that import.",
  "anomalies": "The import of 'conf' inside the 'ready' method is standard practice for Django apps; no suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass, setting application name and verbose name. The 'ready' method imports a local 'conf' module, which is a common pattern for initializing app-specific configuration. There are no hardcoded secrets, data leaks, network calls, or obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward and adheres to standard Django practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Django application configuration snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
