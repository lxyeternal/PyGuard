{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a Django package that integrates Select2 widgets, setting version-related configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Django version via get_version() and imports local module _version for version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves the Django version, compares it, and conditionally sets a configuration variable.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. The version check is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's get_version() function and a local _version module, then sets version info variables. It performs a version comparison to conditionally assign a configuration string. All operations are standard for a Django app setup. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is simple and follows typical Django package initialization patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package initialization script with no malicious intent. It performs standard version detection and configuration setup without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
