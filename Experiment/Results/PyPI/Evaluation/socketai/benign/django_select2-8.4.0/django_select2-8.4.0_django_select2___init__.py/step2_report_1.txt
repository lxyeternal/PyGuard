  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs straightforward version checks and sets configuration variables.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The code is standard initialization.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; it's a benign setup script.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Again, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The version comparison uses string comparison (`get_version() < \"3.2\"`), which can be unreliable if version strings are complex (e.g., \"3.2.1\" vs \"3.2\"). A more robust approach would parse versions numerically.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — the small risk is justified by the version comparison method, but not enough to raise the overall risk significantly.\n- **Justification:** Slightly unconventional version comparison but not malicious.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Same note about string comparison for version check.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** Standard setup code, very low security risk.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Same version comparison note.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — reasonable for the version comparison approach.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent; the slight risk is due to version comparison method.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly indicate 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The version comparison using string comparison could be improved for accuracy, but it does not introduce security risks.\n- No changes needed to the scores based on the provided information.\n\n### Final judgment:\n- The code is a standard, benign Django package initialization snippet.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The only minor concern is the version comparison method, which could be refined, but it doesn't impact security.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to version comparison method, but overall very low)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, straightforward, and does not pose security risks.",
