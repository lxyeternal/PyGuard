  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, importing Django's get_version, importing a local _version module, and setting version info variables. It performs a version check to set default_app_config.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are correctly set to 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, as there's no evident security concern.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no issues found.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with standard version detection and configuration setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, securityRisk is 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more detailed, notes the string comparison for version check. The reviewer mentions that string comparison is less precise but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, obfuscated is 0, securityRisk is 0.1—this seems a bit high given the benign code.\n- **Justification:** The only potential concern is the string comparison, which might cause issues if version formats change, but it doesn't introduce security risks or malicious behavior.\n- **Recommendation:** A score of 0.1 for securityRisk is acceptable, but perhaps slightly high. The malware score remains correctly at 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Very similar to previous reports, standard version check and module import.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, securityRisk is 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard version detection, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, securityRisk is 0.1—possibly a conservative estimate due to version comparison method.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Summary:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated scores:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0, with some at 0.1 due to the version comparison method. Given the code's simplicity, a risk score higher than 0.1 isn't justified.\n- **Version comparison:** Using string comparison (`< \"3.2\"`) is not ideal but is common in simple scripts; it doesn't pose a security risk but could lead to version misinterpretation.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Should remain low, around 0.0 to 0.1, as the code is benign and standard.\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.** The only minor note is that the securityRisk scores of 0.1 due to version comparison are conservative but acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (or possibly 0.1 if being very conservative about version comparison)\n\nThis code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
