{
  "purpose": "To integrate the Select2 JavaScript library with Django by providing widgets and form fields.",
  "sources": "Importing get_version() from django, importing _version from local module",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in the code",
  "flows": "The code reads Django version to determine configuration, but does not process untrusted input or produce outputs based on external data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of version comparison with string may be slightly unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports Django's get_version(), imports local version info, assigns version variables, and sets a default app config based on Django version. The comparison of get_version() with a string is typical for version checks, although string comparison can be less precise than version parsing. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Django package setup for Select2 integration, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain attacks. It only manages configuration based on Django version.",
