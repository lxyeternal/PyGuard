{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Django package for Select2 integration, setting version information and app configuration based on Django version.",
  "sources": "get_version() function call, importing _version module, accessing _version.version and _version.version_tuple",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data outputs or external calls that process untrusted data",
  "flows": "get_version() output compared to string \"3.2\"; version info from _version used to set __version__, VERSION, and default_app_config",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's get_version, retrieves the current Django version, and compares it to a string \"3.2\" to conditionally set a configuration variable. It also imports a local _version module to set version information. All operations are standard for package initialization, with no signs of malicious code or hidden behaviors. The code structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or external network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django package initialization snippet with version checks and configuration setup. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
