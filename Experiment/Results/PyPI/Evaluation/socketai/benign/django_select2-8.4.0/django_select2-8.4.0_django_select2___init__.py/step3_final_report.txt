  "purpose": "Django package initialization and version configuration setup.",
  "sources": "Imports get_version() from Django, imports _version from local module, reads version variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sinks; no external network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Version check flows from get_version() to setting default_app_config based on version comparison.",
  "anomalies": "Uses string comparison for version check, which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard version detection and configuration setup for a Django app. It imports necessary modules, assigns version info, and conditionally sets default_app_config based on Django version. No untrusted input processing, external data handling, or dynamic code execution is present. The version comparison uses string comparison, which could be improved with proper version parsing, but it does not introduce security risks. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django setup snippet with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor concern about version comparison method does not impact security. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
