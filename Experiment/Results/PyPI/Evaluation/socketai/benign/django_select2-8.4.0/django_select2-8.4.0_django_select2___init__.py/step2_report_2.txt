  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `get_version` from Django.\n- Imports `_version` from local module.\n- Sets `__version__` and `VERSION` from `_version`.\n- Checks if Django version < \"3.2\" (string comparison).\n- Conditionally sets `default_app_config`.\n\n**Security Analysis:**\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is straightforward, performing version checks and configuration setup.\n   - No untrusted data processing, external network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - Version comparison uses string comparison, which is common but can be imprecise; however, it doesn't introduce security risks here.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard Django setup.\n   - No false positives or logical errors are noted.\n   - The only minor point is the string comparison of versions, which could be improved with proper version parsing, but this is not a security concern.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Security risk scores are mostly 0 or very low (0.1), consistent with the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence levels are high, reflecting consensus on benignity.\n\n4. **Potential Malicious Behavior or Supply Chain Risks:**\n   - No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling.\n   - The code only performs version detection and configuration, typical for package initialization.\n   - No external data or untrusted inputs are processed.\n\n5. **Assumptions and Claims:**\n   - The reports correctly challenge any assumptions of malicious intent; none are justified.\n   - The version comparison is standard, not an attack vector.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a typical Django package initialization snippet.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity detected.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:** The code's simplicity and lack of external or untrusted data processing make it safe. The only improvement could be to use proper version parsing instead of string comparison, but this does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is benign, with no supply chain or security issues present.",
