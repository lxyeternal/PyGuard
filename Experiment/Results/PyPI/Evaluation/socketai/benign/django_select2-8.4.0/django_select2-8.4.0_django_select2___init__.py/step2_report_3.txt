  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward Django package initialization snippet.\n- The code imports `get_version()` from Django, imports a local `_version` module, and sets version info variables.\n- It performs a version check (`if get_version() < \"3.2\":`) to conditionally set `default_app_config`.\n- No external sinks, data processing, or external calls that process untrusted data are evident.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The version comparison uses string comparison, which can be slightly unconventional but is common in Django version checks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Verifications:\n\n**Code correctness:**\n- The code correctly imports `get_version()` and `_version`.\n- It assigns `__version__` and `VERSION` from `_version`.\n- It performs a version check to set `default_app_config` for Django versions below 3.2.\n- No code execution, external network activity, or data processing is present.\n\n**Malicious or suspicious behavior:**\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The logic is standard for Django app setup.\n- The version comparison, while string-based, is typical in Django codebases.\n\n**Scores analysis:**\n- All reports assign `malware` score as 0, which is appropriate.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), consistent with the benign nature.\n- Confidence scores are high (1 or close), matching the straightforward assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points per report:\n\n**Report 1 & 2:**\n- Both agree the code is benign, standard, and straightforward.\n- Scores are consistent and justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) due to noting the string comparison, but still reasonable.\n- The securityRisk of 0.1 is acceptable given the simplicity.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 4 & 5:**\n- Both maintain the benign assessment.\n- Slightly conservative securityRisk scores (0.0 or 0.1) are justified.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the simplicity and benign nature, a risk score of around 0.0 to 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n**However,** considering the overall context, the code is a standard Django setup snippet with no malicious intent, no external data processing, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### My conclusion:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (very low security risk, standard setup code)\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The slight variation in confidence and security risk scores reflects minor differences in interpretation but doesn't affect the overall benign assessment.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and does not pose security concerns.\n- No modifications to the existing scores are necessary based on the provided information.",
