{
  "purpose": "To integrate Select2 with Django, providing widgets and form fields for enhanced selection interfaces.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Django version via get_version() and imports _version from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or sinks are present; no data is written or transmitted based on user input.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves the Django version, compares it to a string, and conditionally sets a configuration variable.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The code uses a version comparison to set configuration, which is standard practice. No obfuscated or unusual code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Django framework version, retrieves a module-level version, and conditionally assigns a configuration string based on the Django version. It includes descriptive comments and external links. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The version comparison logic is straightforward and typical for compatibility checks. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation for Django plugin compatibility management. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
