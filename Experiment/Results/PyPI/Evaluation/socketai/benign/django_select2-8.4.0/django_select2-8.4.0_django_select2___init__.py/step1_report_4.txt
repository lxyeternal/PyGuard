{
  "purpose": "This code provides metadata and version handling for a Django package integrating Select2 widgets.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Django version using get_version() and imports a version module to access version information.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the get_version() function reads environment or system data, but in Django's context, it is standard and safe. No sinks are evident that lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing get_version() to comparing its output with a string and conditionally setting a configuration variable, with no untrusted data passing to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The version comparison is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports get_version() from Django, retrieves the current Django version, and conditionally sets a configuration variable based on version comparison. It also imports a local _version module to set version info. All operations are standard for package setup. No malicious or unusual behavior is detected; the code performs version checking and module importing as intended.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup snippet for a Django package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on standard Django functions and local version information. The overall security risk is very low.",
