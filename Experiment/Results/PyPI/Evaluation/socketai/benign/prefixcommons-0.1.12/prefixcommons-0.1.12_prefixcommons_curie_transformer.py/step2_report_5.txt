  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, considering the key points:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Indicators:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward CSV/TSV transformer that calls external functions `expand_uri` and `contract_uri`.\n   - No network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated code is observed.\n   - The code itself does not contain any suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors.\n   - The external functions are imported but not shown; their security depends on their implementation, but based on the code snippet, they appear to be standard utility functions.\n\n2. **Potential Risks or Concerns:**\n   - The main concern would be if `expand_uri` or `contract_uri` are malicious or perform harmful actions. However, the reports assume these are benign utility functions.\n   - The code does not process user input beyond filenames, reducing risk of injection or malicious input exploitation.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Scores Justification:**\n   - The reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and low security risk scores (~0.1 to 0.2). These are reasonable given the analysis.\n   - The confidence levels are high (0.9), reflecting the consistent assessment across reports.\n\n4. **Assessment of External Functions:**\n   - Since `expand_uri` and `contract_uri` are external, their security impact is critical. If they are standard, well-tested functions, the risk remains minimal.\n   - If these functions are malicious or contain backdoors, the risk would be higher, but there's no evidence here.\n\n5. **Overall Security Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a benign utility for data transformation.\n   - No malicious activity or supply chain attack indicators are present.\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to reliance on external functions whose security is assumed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code appears to be a safe, standard data transformation utility. The main caveat is the trustworthiness of the external URI functions, but based on the provided code and reports, there is no evidence of malicious intent or activity.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- Confirm the implementation and security of `expand_uri` and `contract_uri`.\n- Maintain current scores unless external functions are found malicious.\n- Continue monitoring for any signs of obfuscation or malicious modifications in external dependencies.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Score |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1             |\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the analysis above.",
