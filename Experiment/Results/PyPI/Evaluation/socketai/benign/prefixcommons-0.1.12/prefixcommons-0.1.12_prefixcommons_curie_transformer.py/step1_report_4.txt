  "purpose": "The code defines classes for transforming data, particularly expanding or contracting URI-like strings within CSV/TSV files.",
  "sources": "Reads data from CSV/TSV files via the open() function for input files.",
  "sinks": "Writes transformed data to output files via the open() function for output files.",
  "flows": "Reads input file -> processes each cell through tr_element() -> writes processed row to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code uses standard library functions. The expand_uri and contract_uri functions are imported but not shown; their behavior is unknown, which is a point of uncertainty but not suspicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a CSV/TSV transformer that processes each cell to expand or contract URI strings, based on the provided configuration. It opens input and output files securely, processes data line by line, and applies transformations. No malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation, is evident. The imported functions could potentially be scrutinized further, but they are standard URI processing functions and their presence does not suggest malicious intent. There are no hardcoded secrets, environment variable misuse, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a straightforward data processing utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CSV/TSV transformer without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard file I/O and data processing tasks, relying on external URI utility functions whose behavior is assumed safe. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
