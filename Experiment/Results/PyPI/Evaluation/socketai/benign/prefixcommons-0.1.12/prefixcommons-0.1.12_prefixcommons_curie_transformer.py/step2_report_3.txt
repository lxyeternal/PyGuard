  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward utility for transforming CSV/TSV files by expanding or contracting URI-like strings.\n- It relies on external functions `expand_uri` and `contract_uri`, whose implementations are not shown.\n- No network activity, credential handling, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- The risk scores assigned are consistently low (around 0.1), and malware scores are zero.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code itself appears correct, with no evident bugs or vulnerabilities.\n   - The external functions are assumed safe; their absence from the snippet prevents deeper static analysis.\n   - No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign and relies on external URI functions.\n   - No logical flaws or overestimations are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate given no malicious activity.\n   - Obfuscated scores are zero, matching the code's clarity.\n   - Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk.\n   - The confidence levels are high (0.9), consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No issues warrant a risk score above 0.5.\n   - The highest risk score is 0.2, which is reasonable.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - No malware activity is suggested or detectable.\n   - External functions are assumed safe; unless proven malicious, malware score remains 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly state that the behavior of `expand_uri` and `contract_uri` is unknown, but they are assumed standard.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - All reports are consistent with each other and with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, primarily due to reliance on external functions whose safety isn't verified but are presumed benign)\n\n**Overall, the code appears to be a benign, standard data transformation utility with no supply chain or security issues.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 | No malicious activity or code behavior detected.            |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.            |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1–0.2           | Low risk; depends on external functions, but assumed safe. |\n\n**Final note:** The security posture is strong; no further action needed based on this code snippet.",
