  "purpose": "Utility for transforming URI-like strings within CSV/TSV files by expanding or contracting them using external URI processing functions.",
  "sources": "Reading input filename for CSV/TSV data, reading data rows from the input file.",
  "sinks": "Writing transformed rows to the output file.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> read data -> process each cell with tr_element (which calls expand_uri or contract_uri) -> write processed rows to output filename.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward. External functions are assumed benign but are not shown.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base Transformer class that manages URI expansion/contraction via external functions. CsvTransformer reads a CSV/TSV file, processes each cell with tr_element, and writes the result. No network activity, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. External functions are critical; their security impacts overall safety but are assumed standard URI utilities. The code is benign, with no malicious logic or vulnerabilities. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior. External functions' trustworthiness is a potential concern but cannot be assessed here. Overall, the code is a safe utility for data transformation with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for URI transformation within CSV/TSV files. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The security posture is very low risk, contingent on the external functions' integrity. Current scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
