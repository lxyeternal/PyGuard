  "purpose": "The code defines classes for transforming data in CSV/TSV files by expanding or contracting URI-like strings using external utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input files read through open(infn) and data processed via csv.reader; data read from user-supplied filenames.",
  "sinks": "Writing transformed data to output files specified by the user; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input files through transformation methods, using expand_uri/contract_uri functions, then outputs to files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed. External functions expand_uri and contract_uri are imported but not shown; assuming they are standard utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a CSV/TSV transformation utility with flexible contraction or expansion of URI strings based on configuration. It reads from user-specified input files, processes each row, and writes to output files. No user input is directly processed beyond filenames; no network activity, credential handling, or embedded malicious code is present. External functions are called for URI processing but are assumed safe. No suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent in this module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for data transformation with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It relies on external utility functions for URI processing, which are not shown, but the usage here does not indicate malicious activity.",
