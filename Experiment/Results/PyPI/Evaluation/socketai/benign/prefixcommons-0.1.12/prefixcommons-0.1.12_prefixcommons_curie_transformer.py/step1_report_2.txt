  "purpose": "The code defines classes for transforming URI strings within CSV/TSV files, expanding or contracting URIs based on provided mappings or functions.",
  "sources": "Reading input file specified by 'infn' using 'open' and 'csv.reader'.",
  "sinks": "Writing to output file specified by 'outfn' using 'open' and 'csv.writer'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input CSV file through 'csv.reader', processed by 'tr_element' (which calls 'expand_uri' or 'contract_uri'), then written to the output file.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of classes inheriting from a base Transformer, with methods for URI expansion and contraction using external functions 'expand_uri' and 'contract_uri'. The 'CsvTransformer' reads data from a CSV or TSV file, processes each cell through 'tr_element', and writes the transformed data to an output file. The processing functions rely on external URI utility functions, but no suspicious code, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward and does not contain any indicators of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs URI transformation within CSV/TSV files without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It utilizes external, presumably benign, URI processing functions. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
