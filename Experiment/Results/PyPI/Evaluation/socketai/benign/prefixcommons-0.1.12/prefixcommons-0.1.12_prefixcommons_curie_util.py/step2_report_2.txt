  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their conclusions with the code, and assess their scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles JSON-LD context reading, prefix map extraction, URI contraction/expansion. No malicious code or obfuscation detected. External URL fetches are noted but considered safe within context.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, considering external fetches could pose risks if sources are compromised, but within this code, it’s not evident.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minor security concern about external sources is acknowledged but not overemphasized.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes safe data handling, no malicious intent, and standard logic.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious or obfuscated code. Slightly lower risk score due to the same reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the benign nature, safe file/network operations, no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is a utility for prefix management with no malicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on potential risks from external URL fetching but concludes the code is benign.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The only potential concern is external URL fetching, but the code itself does not misuse this.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with emphasis on legitimate network and file I/O, no malicious code.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified given the code’s benign nature.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the external URL fetches, a conservative but reasonable score is around 0.2, considering the potential for external source compromise, but the code itself is safe.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — accounts for external data fetching, which could be exploited if sources are malicious, but within the code scope, it’s not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and well-reasoned. The code is a benign utility for managing JSON-LD contexts and URI transformations, with no malware or obfuscation. The minor security concern about external URL fetching is acknowledged but does not elevate the risk significantly.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese reflect the code’s true nature as a safe, standard utility with minimal security concerns.",
