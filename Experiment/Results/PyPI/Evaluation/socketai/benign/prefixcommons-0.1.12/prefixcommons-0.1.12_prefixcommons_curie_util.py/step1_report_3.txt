{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for reading, extracting, contracting, and expanding CURIE prefixes and URIs from JSON-LD context files and remote sources.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from local files (JSON-LD context files in 'registry' directory) and remote URLs via HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident where untrusted data is processed into sensitive operations like code execution, file modification, or network connections beyond standard HTTP GET requests.",
  "flows": "Data flows from remote URLs or local files into JSON parsing, then into prefix mapping functions, with potential use in URI contraction and expansion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors. The code performs standard data processing tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads JSON-LD contexts from local files or URLs, extracts prefix mappings, and performs URI contraction and expansion. It uses safe standard libraries like json, requests, and pathlib, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity beyond fetching publicly available JSON data. Error handling is limited to logging and custom exceptions for prefix issues. There are no evident signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent. The functions rely on straightforward logic for string manipulation and data retrieval, with no signs of covert behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign utility for handling CURIE prefix mappings. It performs safe file and network operations, with no signs of malicious or maliciously obfuscated code. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is very low.",
