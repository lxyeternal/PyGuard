  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing JSON-LD contexts and URI transformations. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security consideration is external URL fetching without validation, which is a common pattern but should be noted. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting external data fetching concerns but no internal malicious behavior."
