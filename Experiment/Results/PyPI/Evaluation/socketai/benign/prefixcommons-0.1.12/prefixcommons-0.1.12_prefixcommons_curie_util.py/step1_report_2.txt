{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to read, extract, contract, and expand CURIEs and IRIs using JSON-LD contexts, primarily for managing prefixes in semantic web or linked data applications.",
  "sources": "Reads data from local JSON files, remote URLs via HTTP requests, and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "Returns data such as prefix maps, contracted CURIEs, and expanded URIs; does not write or send data to external systems.",
  "flows": "Reads JSON/JSON-LD context data from files or URLs, processes them to build prefix maps, then contracts or expands URIs based on prefix mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code observed. Uses standard library functions and common patterns. No suspicious network activity or malicious intent apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code loads context files from local disk and remote URLs to build prefix maps, then provides functions to contract URIs to CURIEs and expand CURIEs to URIs using these maps. It includes error handling classes for various malformed or ambiguous inputs. No code injects untrusted data into system commands, network connections, or files beyond safe reading. Network requests are made using the requests library with proper context management. The URL fetching function logs errors but does not execute code or send data elsewhere. The functions are straightforward and do not contain malicious logic, backdoors, or privacy-invasive behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for managing CURIEs and IRIs with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It handles data securely, with proper error handling and no suspicious network or system operations.",
