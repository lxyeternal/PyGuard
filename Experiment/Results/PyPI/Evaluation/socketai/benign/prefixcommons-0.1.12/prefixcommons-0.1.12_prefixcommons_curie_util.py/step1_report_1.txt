{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for reading and handling JSON-LD context files and prefix maps, as well as contracting and expanding URIs/IRIs based on these contexts.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local JSON files ('registry' directory), URL requests via 'requests.get' for remote JSON-LD contexts, and uses class attributes and constants for internal processing.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the 'requests.get' response which fetches external data. Other data flows include file reading and string processing for URI expansion and contraction.",
  "flows": "The code fetches JSON data from URLs or local files, extracts context mappings, then contracts or expands URIs by matching prefixes and replacing strings accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code are present. The 'requests.get' call does not include URL validation or restrictions, which could pose risks if misused, but within this code, it is used for fetching JSON-LD contexts. No unusual or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing standard data loading and string manipulation tasks. Functions handle file I/O and network requests responsibly, with error logging on failed fetches. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The URL fetch uses context management properly, and no unsafe code execution or data leaks are evident. The code does not include any malicious side-effects or suspicious behaviors, but it relies on external sources which could be compromised outside this scope.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing JSON-LD contexts and URI conversions. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks within its own logic. The only consideration is to ensure external URL sources are trusted; otherwise, the code itself is benign.",
