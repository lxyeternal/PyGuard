{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for reading, extracting, and managing JSON-LD context prefix mappings, and for contracting and expanding URIs/IRIs based on these mappings.",
  "sources": "File I/O for local JSON-LD context files; HTTP GET requests to fetch remote JSON-LD contexts.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted external URLs could lead to data leaks or injection if URLs are maliciously controlled.",
  "flows": "Input data from local files or URLs is parsed into JSON objects, from which prefix maps are extracted. These maps are then used to contract or expand URIs by matching prefixes and replacing parts of the URI accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns. External URL fetches are performed without validation, which could be a concern but is standard for such utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file and network operations to load JSON-LD contexts, then processes these contexts to facilitate URI contraction and expansion. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is reliance on external URLs, which could be compromised outside the code's scope, but this is typical for such context management utilities. Error handling is appropriate, and the code uses standard libraries with proper context management. Overall, the code is straightforward, safe, and serves its purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing JSON-LD contexts and URI transformations. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security consideration is external URL fetching without validation, which is a common pattern but should be noted. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting external data fetching concerns but no internal malicious behavior.",
