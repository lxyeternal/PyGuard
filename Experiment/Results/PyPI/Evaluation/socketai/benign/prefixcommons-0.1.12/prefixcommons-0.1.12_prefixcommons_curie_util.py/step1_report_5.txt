{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for managing and processing CURIEs/IRIs, including reading context files, contracting, and expanding URIs/IRIs based on prefix maps.",
  "sources": "Reads local JSON-LD context files, remote JSON-LD context URLs, and loads context data from predefined registry files.",
  "sinks": "Uses network requests via 'requests.get' to fetch remote context files, potentially exposing network data.",
  "flows": "Reads context data from local or remote sources, extracts prefix mappings, then contracts or expands URIs based on those mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code behavior detected. Use of network requests with no validation or sanitization could be risky but is contextually justified here.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data loading and string manipulation functions for prefix-based URI management. It fetches remote JSON-LD contexts using 'requests', which involves network I/O but is standard for such use cases. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The network request is a common pattern but could be misused if URLs are compromised, yet within this context, it appears intended for legitimate data fetching. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or malware behaviors are identified. The functions are straightforward and do not perform any unsafe or dangerous operations beyond network access and file I/O, which are typical for this purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily focused on prefix map management for URI/IRI contraction and expansion, with legitimate network requests and file I/O. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks in this code fragment.",
