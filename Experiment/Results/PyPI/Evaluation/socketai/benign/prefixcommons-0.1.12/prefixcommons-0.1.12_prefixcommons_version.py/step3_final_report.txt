  "purpose": "Assign a version string to __version__ for package identification.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a direct assignment statement.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "flows": "None; the code is a simple assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single line assigning a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no inputs, outputs, data flows, or complex logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified given the simplicity and transparency of the code. No anomalies or hidden threats are detected. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are consistent with the code's simplicity.",
