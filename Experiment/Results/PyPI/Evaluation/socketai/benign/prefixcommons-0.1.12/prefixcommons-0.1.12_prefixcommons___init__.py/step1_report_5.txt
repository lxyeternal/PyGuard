  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions and classes from local modules for URI processing and CSV transformation, likely as part of a larger project.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input or external data sources are used within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward imports with no unusual language features, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs import statements from local modules, which is typical in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. No external data, network activity, or system modifications are present. The use of __future__ import ensures compatibility and is standard practice. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign, serving as part of a larger module for URI handling and CSV transformation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on these import statements.",
