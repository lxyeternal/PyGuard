  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the evidence for potential security issues, malware, obfuscation, and overall risk.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe minimal code consisting solely of import statements from internal modules (.curie_util and .curie_transformer).\n- No data processing, network activity, user input handling, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger system for URI and CSV handling, common in data processing pipelines.\n- The reports uniformly conclude benign intent with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Importing URI utilities and CSV transformer.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies, no suspicious constructs, no dynamic code, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing data processing utilities.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Similar minimal import code, focusing on URI and CSV modules.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) but still no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (very low), confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No evidence of malicious intent; the low securityRisk score seems to be an overly cautious default, which is acceptable given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Same as others, benign import statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- **Code content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, consisting solely of import statements.\n- **Malware risk:** All scores are zero, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- **Obfuscation:** Zero obfuscation is observed or suspected.\n- **Security risk:** Zero or negligible, as there's no data flow, user input, or dynamic code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain at 0, as the code is purely import statements with no security implications.\n\n**Note:** The reports are consistent with a benign, non-malicious code fragment. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Score |\n|--------------------|--------------|\n| Malware            | 0            |\n| Obfuscated         | 0            |\n| Overall Security Risk | 0        |\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is safe and poses no security threat.",
