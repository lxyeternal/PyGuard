{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports utility functions and classes related to CURIE (Compact URI) handling and transformation, likely for data processing or semantic web applications.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .curie_util and .curie_transformer",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet; no external input or output operations are shown.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs imports without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are observed in this small snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a future import for absolute_import, which is standard for compatibility across Python versions. It then imports specific functions and classes from local modules. There is no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. The imports suggest the module is part of a larger system for handling CURIEs, which is common in semantic web or data normalization tasks. No potential security risks or malicious behavior are identified based solely on these lines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement snippet with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a benign part of a larger project focused on URI or CURIE handling.",
