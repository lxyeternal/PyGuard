{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports utility functions for URI manipulation and a CSV transformer, likely for processing or transforming data related to URIs and CSV formats.",
  "sources": "The code imports from relative modules: .curie_util and .curie_transformer.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident in this fragment; no data processing, network communication, or data leakage points are shown.",
  "flows": "No specific data flow paths are observable in this minimal code snippet; it only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, importing functions for URI expansion, contraction, and a CSV transformer from local modules. There are no data inputs, network operations, or processing logic. The imports are standard for a module that likely performs URI transformations and CSV data handling. Given the simplicity and lack of executable or network-related code, there are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a setup for functionality related to URI handling and CSV transformation. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
