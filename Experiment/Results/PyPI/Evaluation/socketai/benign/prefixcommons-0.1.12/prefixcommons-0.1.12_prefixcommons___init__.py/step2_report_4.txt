  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from internal modules related to URI handling and CSV transformation.\n- No data processing, network activity, or user input handling is present.\n- The code snippets are minimal, consisting solely of import statements.\n- No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The __future__ import (absolute_import) is standard for compatibility and does not indicate malicious intent.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and all reports agree on benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The reported issues are **not** present in the code snippets. The code is straightforward and benign.\n- The logic, reasoning, and summaries are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the reports.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's minimal nature.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- The **malware** scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign description.\n- The **securityRisk** scores are also 0 or very close to 0, consistent with the lack of any security concern.\n- The **obfuscated** scores are 0, matching the clarity of the code.\n- The **risk** scores are 0 or very low, which is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The highest confidence is in the benign assessment.\n\n### Malware scores:\n- Since no malicious activity or payloads are indicated, malware scores should remain at 0.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All claims are based on straightforward observations; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code snippets are benign import statements for internal modules related to URI and CSV processing. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Note:** Given the nature of these snippets, the scores should remain at zero across malware, obfuscated, and security risk categories.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action or concern is warranted based on these snippets.",
