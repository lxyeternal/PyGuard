{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up imports from internal modules related to URI handling and transformation, likely for use in data processing or manipulation tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .curie_util and .curie_transformer",
  "sinks": "No sinks of untrusted data or user input are present in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only performing imports; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions and classes for URI expansion, contraction, and data transformation. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or sensitive data handling. The absence of operational code or user input processing makes it unlikely to contain malicious behavior. The presence of __future__ import suggests compatibility handling, common in library code.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, consisting solely of import statements for internal modules. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
