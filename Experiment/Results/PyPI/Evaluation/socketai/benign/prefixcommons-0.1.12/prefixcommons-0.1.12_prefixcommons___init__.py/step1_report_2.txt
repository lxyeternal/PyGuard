{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a module that imports utility functions and classes related to URI expansion and contraction, and a CSV transformer, likely for data processing or transformation tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: 'curie_util' and 'curie_transformer'. No external input or data reading present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or output; the code only contains import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only imports functions and classes, with no execution or data manipulation shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors observed in these import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements from local modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The imported modules suggest functionality for URI manipulation and CSV transformation, which are common in data processing tasks. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an import section for related utility modules. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks based solely on these lines.",
