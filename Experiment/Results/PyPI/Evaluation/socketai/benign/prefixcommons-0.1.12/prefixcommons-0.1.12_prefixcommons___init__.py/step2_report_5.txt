  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, logical flaws, consistency of scores, and justification for risk assessments.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from internal modules (.curie_util and .curie_transformer).\n- No data processing, network activity, user input, or dynamic code execution is observed.\n- The code is minimal and standard for a module setup.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature described.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), consistent with the absence of evident vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue Presence Confirmation**\n\n**Are the reported issues present?**  \nYes. All reports correctly identify that the code only performs import statements from internal modules, with no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and thorough in their reasoning, correctly concluding benign intent based on the code snippet.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Score Evaluation and Suggestions**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign import statements.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, justified by the lack of data flow or external interactions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo score adjustments needed. The scores align well with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Score Justification**\n\n- The risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1).  \n- Since the code only imports internal modules without any execution, data handling, or external communication, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all reports correctly state that the code is benign.\n- No suspicion of malicious behavior or hidden payloads.\n\n---\n\n### **Consistency of Scores with Reports**\n\n- The scores are consistent across all reports.\n- The high confidence levels support the conclusion of benignity.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment**\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or security risks evident.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely import statements with no operational logic, data flow, or external interactions. It is a standard setup for a module, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with scores appropriately reflecting its harmless nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
