{
  "purpose": "Import internal modules for URI handling and CSV transformation, likely as part of a larger data processing system.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .curie_util and .curie_transformer modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution beyond imports; static code with no runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; standard import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The minimal nature and absence of suspicious patterns indicate benign intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no further security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with import statements for URI and CSV utilities. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk present. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and overall security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
