  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'prefixcommons' Python library, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading package data, dependencies, and metadata from the script variables and the setuptools 'setup' function.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from variable definitions to the 'setup' function which processes package info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious behavior detected. The code strictly adheres to standard packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and package data in variables, then calls 'setup' with these parameters. No dynamic code execution, no input/output beyond package configuration. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. The dependencies are version-restricted but legitimate. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The structure and content align with typical Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, anomalies, or security risks detected. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
