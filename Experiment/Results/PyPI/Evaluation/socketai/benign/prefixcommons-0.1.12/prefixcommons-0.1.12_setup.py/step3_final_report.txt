{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data statically.",
  "sources": "Static variables within the script, including package lists, package data, dependencies, and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function consumes the static data; no untrusted input or external data sources are involved.",
  "flows": "Static data flows directly into the setup() call without dynamic processing or external data fetching.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. The reasoning is consistent and accurate, reflecting the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe Python packaging script with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
