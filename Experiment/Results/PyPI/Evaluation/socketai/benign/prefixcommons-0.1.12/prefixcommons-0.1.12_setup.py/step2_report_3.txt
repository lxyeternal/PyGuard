  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward `setup.py` script for packaging a Python library.\n- It uses static data, no dynamic code, no user input, no network operations.\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, safe, and follows common conventions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Review**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as a standard setup script.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n- **Flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; the code is a typical setup script.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Flaws:** None.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous; no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Flaws:** None.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Also correct; no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Flaws:** None.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; standard packaging code.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Flaws:** None.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Justification**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 for all, justified by the absence of any suspicious or malicious behavior.\n\n**Potential for higher scores:**  \nSince the code is static, well-structured, and free of any malicious patterns, there's no reason to increase the malware or risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimate**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scoring reflects this accurately.",
