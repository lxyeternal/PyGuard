{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'prefixcommons'. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data defining package metadata, dependencies, and package data; it does not read external input or untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is present; the script solely configures package installation parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and typical of setup.py files.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the setuptools library to configure package installation. It defines static lists and dictionaries for package names, data, and requirements. The setup() function is called with these parameters. There are no dynamic evaluations, no user inputs, no external data fetches, and no code execution beyond standard setup configuration. All content appears to be standard and safe for a package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely declares package metadata and dependencies for distribution. The malware score is minimal, and the security risk is negligible.",
