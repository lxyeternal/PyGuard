{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'prefixcommons' Python package, including package metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata, dependencies, and package data; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely defines static package setup information.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and defines package metadata, dependencies, and package data in static variables. It then calls 'setup()' with these parameters. No user input, network operations, or executable code is present. The dependencies are version-restricted but benign. The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, no external data sources, and no suspicious code. It safely defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
