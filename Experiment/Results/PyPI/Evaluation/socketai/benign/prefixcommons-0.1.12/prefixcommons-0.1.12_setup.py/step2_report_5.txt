  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to determine the accuracy of their assessments and scores.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python library.\n- It uses static data, imports only `setuptools`, and calls `setup()` with predefined variables.\n- There are no dynamic inputs, external data fetching, code execution, or network operations.\n- No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n- Dependencies are version-restricted but benign.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or untrusted data handling are present.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a setup script with static imports and data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or execution; static data flows into `setup()`.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; code is standard, safe, and serves its purpose.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `confidence=1`.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; static data, no external input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No processing of untrusted data or external commands.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; standard setup script, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All zero, confidence 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n- Similar findings: static data, no dynamic code, no external data, straightforward setup script.\n\n- **Scores:** All zero, confidence 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n- Same assessment: standard, static data, no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** All zero, confidence 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n- Same as others: static data, no dynamic code, no external input, standard packaging script.\n\n- **Scores:** All zero, confidence 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code Presence:** The code is a typical `setup.py` script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's content.\n- **Reasoning:** The reasoning in all reports is sound; they correctly identify the code as safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should be **0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be **0** — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be **0** — no security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Note:** Since the code is purely static and adheres to standard packaging practices, there's no justification for higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis confirms that the code is safe, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
