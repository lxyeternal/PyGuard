  "purpose": "Manage package versioning and setup configuration for the 'http3_client' package.",
  "sources": "Reading from and writing to the 'version' file.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no direct data leaks or malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "Read version number from 'version' file -> Increment and write back to 'version' file -> Use version in setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a bare except clause, which suppresses all exceptions and could hide errors; simple integer conversion without validation; no apparent malicious behavior, but error handling is weak.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a version number from a file named 'version', increments it, and rewrites it to the same file, then uses this version in package setup. The use of a bare except clause is a poor practice but not malicious. No network activity, credential handling, or suspicious code detected. The logic appears to be for version tracking, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs simple version management for a Python package and does not contain malicious behavior. The main concern is the inadequate exception handling, which could hide errors but does not indicate malicious intent.",
