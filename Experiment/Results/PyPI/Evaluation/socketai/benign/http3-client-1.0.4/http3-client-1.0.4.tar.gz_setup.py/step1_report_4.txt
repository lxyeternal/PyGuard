  "purpose": "Automates version management for the package by reading and updating a version number stored in a file.",
  "sources": "Reads version number from 'version' file; writes new version number back to 'version' file.",
  "sinks": "File write operation to 'version' file.",
  "flows": "Reads version from 'version' -> writes incremented version to 'version' file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a bare except clause, which can hide errors; the code's intent is version control, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to read a version number from a file named 'version' and increment it, then writes back the new version. The try-except block suppresses errors but does not perform any malicious activity. No external network access, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The logic appears straightforward for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple version tracking for the package and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of normal package maintenance.",
