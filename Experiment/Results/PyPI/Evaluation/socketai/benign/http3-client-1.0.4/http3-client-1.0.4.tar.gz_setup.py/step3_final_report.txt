  "purpose": "Manage version number for the package by reading, incrementing, and writing to a local 'version' file.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'version' file, writing to 'version' file",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network communication",
  "flows": "Read 'version' -> increment -> write back -> use in setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad 'except:' clause suppresses all errors silently; no validation of 'version' content; potential race condition if multiple processes modify 'version' concurrently",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple local file I/O to manage a version number, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The broad exception handling can hide errors such as missing or malformed 'version' files, and lack of file locking introduces potential race conditions. No external communication or malicious code is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature but slightly conservative due to error handling concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward, benign version management utility with minor operational risks related to error suppression and race conditions. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The low security risk scores are appropriate, with a slight increase to 0.2 reflecting error handling issues.",
