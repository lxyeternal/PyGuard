  "purpose": "Manage package versioning and setup configuration for the 'http3_client' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads from and writes to a local file named 'version'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Reads the 'version' file to determine current version, increments and rewrites it, then uses this version in package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a broad except clause which suppresses errors silently; increments version without validation, potential race conditions if multiple processes run simultaneously.",
  "analysis": "The code reads the 'version' number from a file, increments it, and writes it back. This manages versioning locally without external inputs. The try-except block suppresses errors without logging or handling, which could hide issues. There is no evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or external communications. The process is straightforward version management. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs basic local version management with minimal error handling and no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a benign setup utility.",
