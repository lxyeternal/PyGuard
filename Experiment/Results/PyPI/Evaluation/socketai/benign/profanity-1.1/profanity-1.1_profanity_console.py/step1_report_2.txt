{
  "purpose": "A command-line utility to check input text or file for profanity, with optional censorship.",
  "sources": "User-supplied filename via '--filename' argument and direct text input via '--text' argument.",
  "sinks": "The 'profanity' library functions 'contains_profanity' and 'censor' are called with untrusted input; these are safe assuming the library is trusted.",
  "flows": "Input sources (file or direct text) flow into profanity library functions; no external or network flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, backdoors, or malicious logic. The code correctly handles input arguments, reads file content, and outputs results. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments to accept either a filename or direct text. It reads input securely from a file or uses provided text. Calls to 'profanity' library functions are straightforward and only relate to profanity checking and censorship, which are standard. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or malicious data handling. The use of 'print' for output is typical. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility designed for profanity checking. It relies on a third-party 'profanity' library for core functionality and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks identified.",
