{
  "purpose": "The script checks input text or file content for profanity, either reporting or censoring as specified.",
  "sources": "User provides input via command-line arguments: a filename or direct text input.",
  "sinks": "The code calls functions from the 'profanity' library; no explicit sinks for untrusted data handling or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "Input (from file or argument) -> profanity functions -> output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code observed. No network activity or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes a third-party 'profanity' library to check or censor profanity in input data. Input can come from a file or direct text input via command-line arguments. The script processes input and outputs results directly. No unsafe or suspicious behavior, such as network communication, data leakage, or malicious code, is detected. The logic is straightforward, and the library usage appears standard. The only notable aspect is reliance on external library functions, which are assumed safe as they perform profanity checks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple utility for profanity detection and censorship with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard Python libraries and a third-party profanity library, with no suspicious behaviors detected.",
