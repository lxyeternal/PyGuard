  "purpose": "A script to check input text or file for profanity, with options to censor or detect profanity.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from a specified file or command-line text argument.",
  "sinks": "Outputs results to standard output (print statements).",
  "flows": "Reads input from file or text argument -> processes with profanity library -> outputs result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Uses standard library imports. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script uses argparse to handle command-line input, reading from a file or text input. It calls functions from the 'profanity' library to check or censor profanity. No data is sent over network, no sensitive data is stored or transmitted. No unsafe code patterns or unusual behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and uses common Python idioms. The imported 'profanity' library is not inherently suspicious; it is a known utility for profanity filtering. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign profanity checking utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely as a command-line tool to analyze text for profanity.",
