  "purpose": "A command-line utility to check for profanity in input text or files.",
  "sources": "User-supplied filename via '-f'/'--filename' argument or direct text input via '-t'/'--text' argument.",
  "sinks": "Printing results to stdout; no untrusted data is sent to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from file or command-line argument, then processed by the 'profanity' library functions, and output is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. Uses standard libraries and a third-party profanity package.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments to accept either a file or text input. It reads the input, then uses the 'profanity' library to check or censor the text, printing the result. No code executes external commands, writes data to network, or accesses environment variables. No malicious behavior or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward, with clear input handling and output, and relies on an external library for core functionality. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious data exfiltration, or unintended behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for profanity detection with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The overall security risk is minimal.",
