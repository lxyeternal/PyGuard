  "purpose": "A library designed to detect and censor profanity in input strings.",
  "sources": "Reading the wordlist file 'wordlist.txt' from the local data directory; reading environment variables (not used explicitly here).",
  "sinks": "Substituting profanity words in the input text; generating random censor characters.",
  "flows": "Input string -> pattern matching and replacement -> output string with censored words.",
  "anomalies": "Uses random seed for censor character selection; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no network or system modification actions; only simple string processing and file I/O.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a list of profanity words from a local file, then checks input text for these words, replacing each occurrence with randomly selected censor characters. No user input is fetched from untrusted sources beyond the input parameter. The only file operation reads a static wordlist, and the random module is used solely for selecting censor characters, with no seed manipulation or external dependencies. There are no network operations, no system modifications, or data leaks involved. The functions are straightforward, with no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns. The design is to censor profanity locally without external communication or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign profanity filter library with no malicious behavior detected. It performs simple file reading, pattern matching, and string substitution for censorship, all within standard and safe practices.",
