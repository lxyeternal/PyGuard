  "purpose": "A library to detect and censor profanity in strings",
  "sources": "Reading from the local 'wordlist.txt' file, random number generation for censor characters",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs observed",
  "flows": "Input text -> profanity check and censoring functions -> modified output",
  "anomalies": "Use of global variables for state management, no validation of external inputs, no network or external data leaks, no code injection points observed",
  "analysis": "The code loads a profanity list from a local file and censors profanity words in input strings using randomly selected censor characters. The use of 'os.path' and file reading is standard; no external network interactions or code execution are present. The censor pool ensures characters are used uniformly. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications are detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign profanity filter with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard file I/O and randomization for censoring, with no suspicious behavior or malware indicators.",
