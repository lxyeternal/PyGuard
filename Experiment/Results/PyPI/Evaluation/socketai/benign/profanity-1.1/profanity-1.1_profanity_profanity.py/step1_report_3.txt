  "purpose": "A library to check for and censor profanity in strings.",
  "sources": "Reading the wordlist from 'wordlist.txt' file and external input via function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily processes input strings for profanity and returns modified strings; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input text -> contains_profanity or censor functions -> word matching and substitution using regex and get_censor_char() -> returns censored or original text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret keys; no suspicious network activity; no obfuscated code or hidden backdoors; use of randomness in get_censor_char() is benign and intended for censoring.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a profanity filter, loading a list of offensive words and replacing them with censor characters. It uses standard Python libraries such as os, random, and re. The loading of words from a local file is straightforward; no external network or data leakage occurs. The get_censor_char() function manages a pool of characters for censorship, which is safe. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. All code operations are consistent with typical content filtering logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign profanity filter library without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It safely processes text input for profanity and replaces offending words with censor characters. There are no security risks or malware detected.",
