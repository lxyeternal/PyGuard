  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is simply a static assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no input sources, data flows, or malicious payloads. The code is minimal and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their reasoning. They correctly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n   - No logical errors or flawed assumptions are evident. The code's simplicity makes such an analysis straightforward.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.  \n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, which aligns with the lack of obfuscation.  \n   - The `confidence` score is 1, reflecting certainty about benignity, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   - None of the reports assign a high risk score; all are 0, which is justified given the code's benign nature.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   - Since the code only contains a version string assignment, there is no indication of malicious intent or behavior. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions and correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's content.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \n- The code is purely a version declaration with no malicious or obfuscated elements.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, and no adjustments to scores are necessary.",
