  "purpose": "Assign a version string to __version__ for package identification.",
  "sources": "No external input; static assignment of a string value.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment with no external data or execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; simple static string assignment, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It involves no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and standard nature mean it poses no security threat. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign assessment. The confidence score is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. All scores are appropriate and justified based on the code's simplicity and purpose.",
