  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no input sources, data flows, sinks, or complex logic.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in describing the code's simplicity.\n   - No errors or flaws are evident; the code is standard practice for Python packages.\n\n3. **Score Evaluations:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1 across all reports, justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Justification:**\n   - The code's benign nature is well established.\n   - No potential vulnerabilities are claimed or implied.\n   - The malware score of 0 is correct; no malicious activity is detected or suspected.\n   - The security risk score of 0 aligns with the absence of any security concerns.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid speculative claims; they correctly state that the code is harmless.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**If I were to assign scores independently:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns perfectly with the reports' conclusions.",
