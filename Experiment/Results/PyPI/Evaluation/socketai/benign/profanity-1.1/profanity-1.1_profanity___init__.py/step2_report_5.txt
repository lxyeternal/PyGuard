  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no input sources, data processing, or outputs involved.\n   - No suspicious or malicious activity is present in the code snippets.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly state that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - The reasoning that the code is harmless is sound given its simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (correct)\n     - `malware`: 0 (correct)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (correct)\n   - The scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a risk of 0, and the code is just a version string, this is justified.\n   - No reason to elevate the risk score; the code is benign.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports assign malware = 0, which is correct.\n   - No malicious behavior or payloads are detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward observations; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n   - The reports correctly interpret the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - No discrepancies or contradictions are present.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard version declaration.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nAll reports are correct. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No further action or concern is necessary.",
