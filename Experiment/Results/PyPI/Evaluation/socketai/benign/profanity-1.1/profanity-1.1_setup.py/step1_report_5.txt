{
  "purpose": "The script is intended to set up and install the 'profanity' Python library, which detects and censors profanity in strings.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, imports the 'profanity' module, and attempts to load version info from it. It also reads external files such as 'wordlist.txt'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present. The code primarily handles package setup and configuration.",
  "flows": "The module import may access 'profanity.__version__' and the external 'wordlist.txt' data file; however, these are standard behaviors for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of both 'distutils.core' and 'setuptools' for setup, but this is common. No hardcoded secrets, code injection, or suspicious network activity is detected. No obfuscated code or unusual logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures. It imports the 'profanity' module to access its version and description for packaging. It conditionally imports 'setuptools' for enhanced setup capabilities. External data files are included for package resources. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and follows typical Python packaging patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script for packaging the 'profanity' library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. All operations are typical for Python package distribution.",
