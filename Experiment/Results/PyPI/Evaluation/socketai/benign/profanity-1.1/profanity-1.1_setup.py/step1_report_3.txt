  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the 'profanity' Python package, including metadata, package data, and entry points.",
  "sources": [
    "import profanity",
    "from distutils.core import setup",
    "try: from setuptools import setup",
    "setup() call with parameters"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "setup() function that installs package metadata and data files",
    "entry_points that define console_scripts"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Imports 'profanity' module for version info",
    "Calls 'setup()' with package details and data files",
    "Defines console script 'profanity' pointing to 'profanity:main'"
  ],
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard package setup code. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package. It imports the 'profanity' module to access its version, uses try-except to import 'setuptools' or fallback to 'distutils', and calls 'setup()' with package metadata, data files, and entry points. All operations are standard for Python package distribution. No malicious activity, hidden backdoors, or malicious data handling is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate setup script for distributing a Python package named 'profanity'. It performs standard package installation configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
