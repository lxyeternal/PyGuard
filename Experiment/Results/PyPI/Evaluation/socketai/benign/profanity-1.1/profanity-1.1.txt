      "conclusion": "This setup script is entirely benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is negligible (0). The slight securityRisk of 0.1 in one report can be confidently lowered to 0, as there is no actual vulnerability."

Minor adjustments to risk scores (setting to 0) could be made, but current scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior."
