  "purpose": "Utility functions for creating and decoding memo instructions in Solana blockchain transactions.",
  "sources": "Instruction data and account list within the 'Instruction' object.",
  "sinks": "Instruction creation with specified account metadata and message bytes.",
  "flows": "Instruction's accounts and data are used as inputs to decode; parameters are used to construct new instructions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; message bytes are used directly without validation, which is typical for such utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions for handling memo instructions, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. It uses standard libraries and data handling patterns. The message bytes are passed directly, which is typical in this context. No network activity or external data sources are involved. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functional, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk scores are appropriate given the lack of validation on message bytes, which is standard for such utility functions. No adjustments are necessary.",
