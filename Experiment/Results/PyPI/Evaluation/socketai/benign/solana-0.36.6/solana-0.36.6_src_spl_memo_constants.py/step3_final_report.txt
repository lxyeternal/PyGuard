  "purpose": "Define a constant representing the Memo program's public key on Solana blockchain.",
  "sources": "Static string assigned to Pubkey.from_string() method.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a known class and assigns a static, well-known program ID string to a constant. No dynamic inputs, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The string is a recognized program ID for the Memo program on Solana, indicating benign intent. The code is simple, clear, and standard for blockchain configuration. No security issues, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static constant definition for a known blockchain program ID. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk, with high confidence in this assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
