  "purpose": "Define a constant public key for the Memo program in a blockchain context.",
  "sources": "The string 'MemoSq4gqABAXKb96qnH8TysNcWxMyWCqXgDLGmfcHr' used in Pubkey.from_string() method.",
  "sinks": "The Pubkey object that could be used in blockchain transactions or program calls.",
  "flows": "The string is converted into a Pubkey object which is then used as an identifier; no untrusted data input or external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior; straightforward assignment of a known constant.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a library, then defines a constant Pubkey object from a static string. No input/output operations, no dynamic execution, no secrets or credentials. The string appears to be a known identifier for the Memo program. The code is minimal and focused solely on defining a constant identifier with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, establishing a constant public key for use in blockchain interactions. No malicious behavior, no malicious intent detected.",
