{
  "purpose": "Defines a constant for the Memo program's public key using the solders library.",
  "sources": "The code imports the Pubkey class from the solders.pubkey module and then uses it to create a public key from a string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, user input, or external data sources are present; the code only initializes a constant.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process untrusted data or user input, just assigns a hardcoded string to a constant.",
  "anomalies": "The public key is hardcoded, but this is typical for known program identifiers; no suspicious or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a cryptographic key class and initializes a constant with a well-known public key string. The key appears to be a standard identifier for the Memo program. No dynamic code execution, input processing, or suspicious logic is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is straightforward and intended to set a constant value.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, merely defining a constant for a known program ID. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
