  "purpose": "Defines a constant Pubkey for the Memo program used in blockchain transactions.",
  "sources": "The string 'MemoSq4gqABAXKb96qnH8TysNcWxMyWCqXgDLGmfcHr' in the from_string method.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send or store data externally, nor does it process untrusted input beyond a static string.",
  "flows": "The static string flows from the from_string method into the Pubkey object, serving as a fixed identifier.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded public key is standard for blockchain program IDs; no unusual or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Pubkey class, then assigns a known static string to create a constant Pubkey object. There is no input handling, no data manipulation, and no external communication. The static string appears to be a well-known program ID for a Memo program on the Solana blockchain, which is legitimate. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply sets a constant identifier for the Memo program. It appears benign and is consistent with standard blockchain development practices. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
