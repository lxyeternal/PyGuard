  "purpose": "Define a constant for the Memo program's public key identifier in a blockchain application.",
  "sources": "The string literal \"MemoSq4gqABAXKb96qnH8TysNcWxMyWCqXgDLGmfcHr\" used in Pubkey.from_string() method.",
  "sinks": "The Pubkey.from_string() method which converts the string into a Pubkey object.",
  "flows": "Input string literal -> Pubkey.from_string() -> Pubkey object assigned to MEMO_PROGRAM_ID.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code simply assigns a known constant public key. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Pubkey class, then creates a constant PUBKEY for the Memo program using a static string. The string appears to be a well-known public key identifier in the context of blockchain programs. There are no inputs from external sources or user inputs, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution. The code's purpose is to define a constant value, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, defines a known public key constant, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears to be a benign configuration snippet.",
