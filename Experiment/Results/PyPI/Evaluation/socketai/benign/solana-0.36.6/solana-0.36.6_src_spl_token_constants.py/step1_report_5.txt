{
  "purpose": "Define constants and public keys related to SPL token programs on Solana blockchain.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals representing public keys and numerical constants.",
  "targets": "These constants are used throughout blockchain programs to identify token programs, mints, and account lengths.",
  "flows": "Constants are used as identifiers in blockchain interactions; no direct data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets other than standard blockchain identifiers, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports a library for handling public keys and defines several constants related to token account lengths, program IDs, and native token details. All strings are public keys for well-known programs or tokens. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward, static configuration for blockchain interaction.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of constants for SPL token programs on Solana, with no malicious intent, no suspicious activity, and no security risks present.",
