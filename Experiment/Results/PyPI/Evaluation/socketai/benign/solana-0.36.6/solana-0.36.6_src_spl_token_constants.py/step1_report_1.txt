{
  "purpose": "Define constants related to SPL token programs and associated public keys for Solana blockchain interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statement for Pubkey; string literals passed to Pubkey.from_string() methods.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; no untrusted data or user input processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions; static constants are initialized without dynamic input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code only defines constants and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of constant definitions for public keys and data lengths related to SPL tokens on Solana. It imports a class and creates static instances of Pubkey using predefined string literals. There is no input processing, no data transmission, and no complex logic. The public keys are well-known Solana program IDs and mint addresses, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. The code appears to serve as a configuration or constants module for a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a straightforward set of constants for blockchain program IDs and token parameters. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behavior.",
