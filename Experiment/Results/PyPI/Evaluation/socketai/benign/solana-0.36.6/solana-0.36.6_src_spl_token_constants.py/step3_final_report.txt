{
  "purpose": "Defines constants for Solana SPL token program IDs, data lengths, and mint addresses, serving as configuration data.",
  "sources": "Static string literals representing public keys and data lengths; no external input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; all values are statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a known library and assigns static, well-known public key strings to constants. It contains no dynamic logic, input processing, or network activity. The constants are standard for Solana SPL token configurations. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate a benign configuration module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration defining well-known public keys and data lengths for Solana SPL tokens. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this benign nature.",
