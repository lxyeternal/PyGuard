{
  "purpose": "Define constants related to SPL token program, including program IDs and data lengths for tokens and multisig accounts.",
  "sources": "Imports from solders.pubkey, string literals for program IDs.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from source to sink occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious activity detected. Constants and program IDs are standard and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of defining constants related to the SPL token ecosystem. It imports a public key class, sets fixed data lengths for token accounts, multisig accounts, and mints, and assigns known public key strings to constants representing program IDs and the wrapped SOL mint. All values are static and match known, legitimate Solana token program identifiers. There is no dynamic code execution, no data manipulation, and no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign set of constant definitions for use in Solana token program integrations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
