{
  "purpose": "Define constants related to SPL token programs and associated public keys for use in blockchain transactions.",
  "sources": "Constants are assigned from static string inputs converted to Pubkey objects; no user input or external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or operations that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; the code solely initializes constants with static values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward constant definitions with no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a library and sets several constants, including data lengths and fixed public key addresses related to the SPL token standard. All values are hardcoded static strings converted to Pubkey objects. No user input, network operations, or data processing is present. The constants serve as configuration parameters for other programs or scripts. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or insecure, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of constant definitions used for blockchain interactions with the SPL token program. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears to be safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
