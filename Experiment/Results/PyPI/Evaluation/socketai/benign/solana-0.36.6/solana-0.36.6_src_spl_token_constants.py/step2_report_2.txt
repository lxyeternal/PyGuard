  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is purely defining constants—public keys, data lengths, and program IDs.\n   - The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute any dynamic logic.\n   - No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly state that the code is benign and serves as configuration/constants.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - The analysis in each report is thorough and aligned with the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is static, contains no dynamic or malicious behavior, and only defines well-known constants, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified; there's no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is straightforward.\n   - The overall security risk is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Challenging Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made that require challenge.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently assign zero scores for malware and obfuscation, and a security risk of zero.\n   - This aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — Static constants for well-known public keys; no security risk.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code is a standard constants module for Solana SPL token interaction.\n- No signs of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores and analysis are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
