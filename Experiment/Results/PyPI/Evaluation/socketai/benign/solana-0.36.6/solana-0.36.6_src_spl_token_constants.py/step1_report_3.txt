{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and public key identifiers for SPL token programs and associated data lengths used in Solana blockchain interactions.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments and imports from the 'solders.pubkey' module, including string literals for public keys.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data flow; the code only initializes constants and imports.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from external sources or untrusted inputs; only static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all public keys are hardcoded standard identifiers, and no suspicious code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions and static imports for well-known Solana program IDs and token parameters. All public keys correspond to recognized standard accounts used in Solana SPL token ecosystem. There are no dynamic or user-supplied inputs, nor any code that executes external commands, network operations, or data manipulations. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward declaration of constants related to Solana's SPL token standards. It does not contain malicious intent or suspicious behavior; it appears to be a standard configuration file with public key constants.",
