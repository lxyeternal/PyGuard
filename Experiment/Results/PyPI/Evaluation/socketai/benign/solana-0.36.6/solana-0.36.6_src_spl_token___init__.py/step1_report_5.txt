  "purpose": "Client code for interacting with the SPL Token Program",
  "sources": "User inputs or function parameters related to token interactions",
  "sinks": "Blockchain transactions, network requests, or wallet operations",
  "flows": "Input data from user or external sources → processing functions → blockchain/network calls",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is a straightforward client interface with the SPL Token Program",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a simple client interface designed to interact with the SPL Token Program. It does not contain any embedded logic, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious functions. No suspicious data flow, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The description suggests standard client operations, likely involving transaction creation or querying, but without any code snippets, specific risks cannot be identified. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Based on the provided description, the code seems safe and aligns with expected functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard client interface for the SPL Token Program with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe based on the provided description.",
