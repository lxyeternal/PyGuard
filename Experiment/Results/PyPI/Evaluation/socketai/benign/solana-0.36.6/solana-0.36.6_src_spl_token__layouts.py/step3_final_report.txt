{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and instruction types for token operations in a blockchain context, likely Solana.",
  "sources": "Code reads static data schemas for instruction layouts and enums; no external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects; purely static definitions.",
  "flows": "Static data definitions without runtime data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static schema definitions using the 'construct' library, with enums for instruction types. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle external input. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero, reflecting its benign, declarative nature. The security risk is minimal, given the absence of runtime logic or external dependencies. All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of data layouts for token instructions, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score 0, aligning with its static, structural purpose.",
