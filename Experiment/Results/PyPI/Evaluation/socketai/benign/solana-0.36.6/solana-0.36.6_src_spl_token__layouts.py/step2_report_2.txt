  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Data layouts and instruction types for token operations.  \n- Findings: No untrusted data processing, no malicious code, standard data structure definitions.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Confidence: 0.9  \n- Evaluation: The report correctly identifies that the code is purely structural, with no malicious behavior. The high confidence score aligns with the analysis.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining data layouts and instruction types.  \n- Findings: No untrusted data flow, no suspicious code, standard schemas.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Confidence: 0.9  \n- Evaluation: The assessment is consistent. The code is static data schemas, with no signs of malicious activity.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Same general purpose, likely for Solana token instructions.  \n- Findings: No dynamic execution, no external calls, no malicious patterns.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Confidence: 1.0  \n- Evaluation: The analysis is thorough and confirms the code is standard schema definitions.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Data schemas for token instructions, no external input processing.  \n- Findings: No malicious code, no obfuscation, purely declarative.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Confidence: 1.0  \n- Evaluation: Consistent with previous reports; no malicious activity detected.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Token instruction layouts, no runtime logic.  \n- Findings: Static definitions, no external data handling, no suspicious patterns.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Confidence: 1.0  \n- Evaluation: Correctly identifies that the code is benign schema definitions.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:**  \n  All reports agree that the code only defines data structures and instruction types for blockchain token operations. There are no signs of code execution, external data handling, or malicious behavior.  \n\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:**  \n  No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports. They are consistent and accurately describe the code's nature.  \n\n- **Scores Justification:**  \n  All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate given the static, schema-only nature of the code. The security risk scores are also minimal, reflecting the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.  \n\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:**  \n  Since the code is purely declarative and does not execute any untrusted code or handle external data, the risk score should remain very low, close to 0. The malware score is correctly at 0, indicating no malicious activity.  \n\n- **Potential Assumptions:**  \n  The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly identify the code as data schemas without any malicious implications.  \n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (to account for minimal inherent risk in schema definitions, but essentially negligible)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of data layouts for token instructions, with no malicious or suspicious elements. It is a legitimate component of a blockchain SDK or protocol.",
