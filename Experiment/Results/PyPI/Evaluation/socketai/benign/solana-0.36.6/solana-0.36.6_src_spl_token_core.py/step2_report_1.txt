  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a helper module for managing SPL tokens on Solana, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. It reads data from blockchain responses and constructs transactions for legitimate operations.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's structure. The code uses standard SDK functions, handles multi-signer scenarios, and performs legitimate token operations. No signs of malicious behavior or hidden logic are evident.\n\n- **Justification for scores:** The low risk score (0.1) is reasonable given the benign nature of the code. The malware score of 0 is justified, as no malicious activity is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code constructs transactions for token management, with potential security concerns only if external inputs are maliciously manipulated.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard utility module. The potential for misuse exists if inputs are malicious, but this is typical for such SDK code. No malicious code or obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Justification:** The slightly higher risk score (0.2) accounts for the fact that if an attacker controls inputs, they could craft malicious transactions. But the code itself remains benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward implementation of transaction helpers, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code. It is a standard SDK helper with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Justification:** The low risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing that the code is a benign utility module for token operations, with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, confirms the code is a legitimate utility for SPL token management, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code only constructs blockchain transactions using standard SDK functions; no malicious or hidden behaviors are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear, structured, and uses standard SDK calls.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The scores range from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security risk. Given the code's purpose and structure, these are reasonable. The only concern is potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but that is outside the scope of static code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal inherent security risk, primarily related to external input validation, which is standard for such SDK helper code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and reasonable. The code appears safe, legitimate, and well-structured, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                      |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1                    |\n\nThis aligns with the overall analysis that the code is a standard, benign helper module for Solana SPL token management.",
