  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Content of the Code**:\n   - All reports indicate that the provided code snippet is solely a comment or documentation string, with no actual executable code, functions, or logic.\n   - No input sources, data flows, sinks, or operational behavior are present in the snippet.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks**:\n   - Since there is no code, no data handling, no network operations, and no suspicious constructs, there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n   - All reports agree that the snippet is benign and merely descriptive.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that without actual code, no security analysis is possible.\n   - The confidence levels vary but are generally low, reflecting the limited information.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of executable code or suspicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is reasonable since there's no code to obfuscate.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All assign 0, consistent with the lack of any operational code or suspicious features.\n\n5. **Potential for Changes in Scores**:\n   - Given the content, no score adjustments are necessary.\n   - The low confidence scores (around 0.2 to 1) are appropriate, considering the minimal information.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - If future code snippets contain actual implementation, a thorough review would be necessary.\n   - The current assessment aligns with best practices: no code, no risk.\n\n**Final Summary & Recommendations**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the benign nature of the provided snippet.\n\n**Overall Judgment**:\nBased on the step-by-step review, the current assessment is correct: there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk in the provided code snippet. No further action or score adjustments are needed.",
