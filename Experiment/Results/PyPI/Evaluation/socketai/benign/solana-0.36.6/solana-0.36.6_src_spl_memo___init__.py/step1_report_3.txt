  "anomalies": "No code provided beyond a descriptive comment; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or obfuscated code observed",
  "analysis": "The provided code is only a descriptive comment indicating it's client code for a Memo Program. There are no actual code statements, functions, or logic present to analyze for malicious behavior, data flow, or security risks. Without executable code, there are no sources, sinks, or flows to evaluate. The code appears benign and non-malicious based on the limited snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this comment, there is no evidence of malicious intent, anomalies, or security risks. The code is simply a description with no executable content. More code would be necessary to perform a thorough security assessment.",
