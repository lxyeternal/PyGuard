  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, logical flaws, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a well-structured utility for Solana SPL token instructions, with proper validation, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, considering the code's purpose and validation.\n- **Justification:** The report's confidence is high (0.95), and no malicious activity is identified. The code is standard SDK-like, with no suspicious behaviors.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard instruction creation and decoding, no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified, as the code performs standard operations.\n- **Justification:** The high confidence (1) and absence of suspicious code support these scores.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard SPL token instruction functions, with proper validation, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, reflecting the low potential for security issues.\n- **Justification:** The report's confidence (0.95) and the code's straightforward nature justify this.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern — standard instruction creation and decoding, validation present, no malicious signs.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — low, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** The confidence (0.9) and lack of suspicious activity support these scores.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Describes the code as a standard utility for SPL token instructions, with validation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — justified.\n- **Justification:** The analysis indicates no malicious intent, and the code is typical for such libraries.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, consistent with the straightforward, well-structured code.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1–0.2), appropriate given the code's purpose and validation.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, well-validated implementation of SPL token instruction creation and decoding.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The assigned scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, due to the nature of instruction creation; standard validation and no suspicious logic.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. The code appears safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
