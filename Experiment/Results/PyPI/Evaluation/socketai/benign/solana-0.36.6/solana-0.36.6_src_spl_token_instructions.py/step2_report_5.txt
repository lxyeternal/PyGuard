  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the reasonableness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a well-structured utility library for Solana SPL token instructions, with proper validation, no suspicious behaviors, and standard functionality.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code appears clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, given the code's purpose and validation.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis report correctly assesses the code as benign. The high confidence (0.95) and the scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code handles SPL token instructions securely, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code clarity is evident.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — very low, as expected.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code's nature. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard for SPL token instruction creation, with proper validation and no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, given the benign purpose.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores are consistent; the code is standard and secure.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code provides standard instruction functions with validation, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — low, matching the benign analysis.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard implementation for instruction creation and decoding, with validation and no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — low, given the benign purpose.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is purely for instruction building and decoding, with no malicious payloads or network activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, consistent with the clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.0 to 0.2), reflecting the code's purpose as a utility library with validation, not executing untrusted code or performing risky operations.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to potential misuse if instructions are misapplied, but not inherent in the code itself.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's purpose. No adjustments needed. The code is safe, standard, and non-malicious.",
