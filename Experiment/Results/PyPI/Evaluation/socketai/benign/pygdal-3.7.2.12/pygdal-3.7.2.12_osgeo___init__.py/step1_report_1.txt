{
  "purpose": "Initialize and configure the osgeo package, including DLL loading, version handling, and Python compatibility warnings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('PATH', 'USE_PATH_FOR_GDAL_PYTHON'), system modules (sys, os, glob, importlib), and internal module files (__file__).",
  "sinks": "Importing internal _gdal module, issuing warnings or raising exceptions based on Python and GDAL version compatibility.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> DLL directory setup -> importlib import of _gdal -> version checks and warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The DLL loading logic is conditional and based on environment variables; no malicious intent apparent. The version compatibility warnings are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs environment setup and version compatibility checks for the osgeo package. It loads DLLs based on environment variables and system state, imports an internal module dynamically, and issues warnings or errors if Python or GDAL versions are incompatible. No obfuscated code patterns, malicious network activity, or suspicious behavior are present. The version check logic is standard and necessary for compatibility management. The environment variable usage for DLL loading is standard practice, and no data exfiltration or malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical initialization script for a Python package managing native dependencies and version compatibility. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or malware characteristics. It includes standard environment handling, dynamic importing, and version warnings, all consistent with legitimate package setup procedures.",
