{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to build and configure Python bindings for GDAL, including compiling C++ extensions, checking system dependencies, and setting up package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'GDAL_VERSION' file, environment variables (GDALHOME), system commands ('gdal-config'), and files like 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.check_output for system commands, potentially exposing command outputs, and writes to files (e.g., 'gdal_python_cxx11_test.cpp').",
  "flows": "Sources (files, env vars, commands) lead to system calls, file operations, and extension compilation. No data flows directly to untrusted sinks like network or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. The code writes a temporary C++ test file for compiler feature detection, which is standard practice. No obfuscated code, misleading variables, or unusual logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs system dependency checks, file operations, and compiler feature testing. It handles environment variables, runs system commands, and manipulates files in a typical build process. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors are evident. The only notable operation is creating and deleting a C++ test file for compiler support detection, which is a legitimate build step. The code does not execute untrusted input, nor does it include any hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for building Python C++ extensions for GDAL bindings. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It has a low malware score and security risk score, with high confidence based on the provided content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
