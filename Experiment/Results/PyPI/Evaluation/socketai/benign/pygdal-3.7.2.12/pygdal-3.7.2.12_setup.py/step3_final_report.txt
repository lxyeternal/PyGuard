{
  "purpose": "Build setup script for GDAL Python bindings, handling configuration, compilation, and packaging tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads 'GDAL_VERSION' file, invokes 'gdal-config' via subprocess, creates temporary C++ test files, accesses environment variables for GDAL paths.",
  "sinks": "System calls to 'gdal-config', file creation/deletion, environment variable access, subprocess execution for compilation checks.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> fetches config via subprocess -> creates temporary files for compiler feature detection -> sets environment variables and paths -> compiles extensions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses stderr redirection during compilation to suppress errors, which is common but could hide build issues; no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build operations for native Python extensions involving GDAL. It reads configuration data, performs compiler feature detection, manages environment variables, and compiles extensions. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess calls are typical for build scripts, and temporary file handling is standard for compiler feature tests. The use of stderr redirection is a common practice in build scripts, not malicious. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard build setup for GDAL Python bindings with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) is appropriate given the context. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
