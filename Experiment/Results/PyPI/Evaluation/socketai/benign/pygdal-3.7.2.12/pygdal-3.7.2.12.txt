The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) is appropriate given the context. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate package initialization script for the osgeo package, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The potential security concern is DLL hijacking via environment variables, which is a known risk but not indicative of malicious activity. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2 due to environment variable reliance. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose."
