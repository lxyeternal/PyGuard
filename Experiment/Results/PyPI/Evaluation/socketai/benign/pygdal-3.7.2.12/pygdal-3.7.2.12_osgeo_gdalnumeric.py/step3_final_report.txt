{
  "purpose": "Import modules related to geospatial data processing and issue a deprecation warning about import practices.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy and osgeo.gdal_array modules, and the warning function from warnings.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication; code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only module imports and a warning message are executed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from numpy import *' (wildcard import), which is discouraged; presence of a deprecation warning about 'import gdalnumeric' despite not importing it.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a warning. No data processing, external communication, or untrusted input handling occurs. The wildcard import is a poor practice but not malicious. The warning indicates outdated practices but does not imply malicious activity. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The minimal nature of the code and the absence of suspicious patterns suggest it is benign. The only issues are coding style and deprecated practices, which do not constitute security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware or malicious intent. The only concerns are poor coding practices (wildcard import) and a deprecation warning about import style. The overall security risk is negligible.",
