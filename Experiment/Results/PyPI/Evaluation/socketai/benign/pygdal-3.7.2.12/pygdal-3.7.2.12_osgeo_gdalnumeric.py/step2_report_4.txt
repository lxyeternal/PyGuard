  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code to ensure consistency, accuracy, and appropriate risk assessment.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements and a deprecation warning.\n- No data processing, external communication, or handling of untrusted inputs is present.\n- The use of `from numpy import *` is discouraged but not malicious.\n- The deprecation warning indicates awareness of better practices but does not affect security.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Importing modules with a warning; no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as benign. The deprecation warning is noted but not problematic.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0, obfuscated 0 — **appropriate**.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; benign import statements with a deprecation warning.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; no malicious behavior or suspicious patterns.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0 — **appropriate**.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same import pattern; mentions namespace pollution due to wildcard import.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that `from numpy import *` is discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal code and lack of malicious activity, a security risk of 0.1 seems slightly high but still acceptable considering poor practice. Malware score remains 0.\n- **Recommendation:** The security risk score could be lowered to 0, as there's no actual vulnerability or malicious intent.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar to above; no data flow or malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; highlights the poor practice but no security concern.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1 — acceptable, but could be reduced to 0.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same as others; standard imports with deprecation warning.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that no malicious activity is present.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2 — again, acceptable but perhaps slightly overestimating the risk from poor practices alone.\n\n---\n\n### **Consolidated assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all cases, consistent with the clear, minimal code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly higher in some reports (up to 0.2), but given the code's nature, these should be **lowered to 0** because no actual security risk exists.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The code is **benign**; no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The use of wildcard imports is poor practice but not security-related.\n- The deprecation warning does not indicate a security issue but suggests code modernization.\n\n### **My estimated scores:**\n\n| Category          | Score |\n|-------------------|---------|\n| Malware           | 0       |\n| Obfuscated        | 0       |\n| Security Risk     | 0       |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, non-malicious import snippet with some poor practices (wildcard import) and a deprecation warning. No evidence supports assigning any meaningful security risk or malware score. The current assessments slightly overstate the risk; I recommend setting all risk scores to zero.\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is safe and benign.",
