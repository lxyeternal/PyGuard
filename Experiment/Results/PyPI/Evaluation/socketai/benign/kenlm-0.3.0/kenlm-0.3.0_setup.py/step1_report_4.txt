{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for building and installing a Python package called 'kenlm', which involves compiling C++ source files into a Python extension module using CMake and setuptools.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'MAX_ORDER'; command-line arguments '--max_order'; glob patterns for source files in 'util', 'lm', 'python', and 'util/double-conversion' directories; reading system info via platform.system(); compile_test function checks for header and library presence by attempting compilation; subprocess calls to run 'cmake' and compile code.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to 'cmake' and compilation commands are executed with controlled environment variables; no untrusted input directly passed to dangerous functions; no data output or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and command-line arguments influence compilation parameters; compile_test determines inclusion of optional libraries; subprocesses run CMake and build commands, using preset arguments and environment; the build process compiles C++ code into a Python extension.",
  "anomalies": "The compile_test function executes shell commands that attempt to compile small test programs, which is normal for checking header/library presence. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names. The code dynamically adjusts build flags based on platform and environment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard build configuration script utilizing setuptools and CMake to compile C++ extension modules for Python. It includes platform-specific adjustments, environmental checks, and dynamic inclusion of libraries based on compile-test results. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert operations. All subprocess calls are aimed at compiling code and do not involve network communication or data leaks. The presence of shell commands with variable interpolation appears controlled and intended for build purposes. No suspicious code paths, hidden behaviors, or malicious logic are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build configuration for the 'kenlm' Python package. It performs environment checks, platform-specific adjustments, and compilation steps necessary for building the extension module. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks in the code analyzed.",
