{
  "purpose": "The script loads a language model, scores sentences, checks out-of-vocabulary words, and demonstrates stateful querying of the model.",
  "sources": "Reads the model file '../lm/test.arpa' from the filesystem; reads input sentences defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "Uses the kenlm library functions for scoring; no untrusted data sources or external sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Loads model from filesystem -> Scores sentences -> Checks OOV words -> Performs stateful scoring with model states.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials or malicious intent apparent. The code relies on local filesystem paths and the kenlm library, which is standard for language modeling tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes and loads a language model from a local file, performs sentence scoring, checks for out-of-vocabulary words, and demonstrates stateful querying using the kenlm library. All operations appear standard and intended for language modeling analysis. There are no signs of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication. The use of the kenlm library and filesystem access are typical in NLP applications, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward example of using the kenlm language modeling library for scoring sentences and managing language model states. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe to use and does not present any supply chain security concerns.",
