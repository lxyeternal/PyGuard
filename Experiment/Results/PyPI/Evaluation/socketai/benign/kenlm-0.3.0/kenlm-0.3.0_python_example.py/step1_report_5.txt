{
  "purpose": "The script loads a language model using kenlm, evaluates sentences, computes scores, checks for OOV words, and demonstrates stateful querying of the model.",
  "sources": "The code reads the language model file (test.arpa) from the filesystem and processes the input sentence 'language modeling is fun.'. It also reads OOV words from the model's vocabulary.",
  "sinks": "The code prints output to the console; no untrusted data is written externally or used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The input sentence flows through scoring functions, which compute probabilities and scores, then OOV detection logic processes each word for membership in the model vocabulary.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated logic, or suspicious code patterns are present. The script only performs standard language model evaluation. The code appears straightforward without hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a language model and performs standard evaluation tasks: scoring sentences, comparing full scores with direct scores, detecting OOV words, and using stateful query functions. It uses the kenlm library for language modeling, which is a legitimate tool. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful file manipulations. All functions and operations are typical for language model evaluation. The script reads a local file and outputs scores, with no user input or external untrusted data involved. The overall structure is simple and purposeful, with no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward language model evaluation script using kenlm. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It performs expected operations for language modeling tasks without any indication of sabotage or malware.",
