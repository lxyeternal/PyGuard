{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm, intended for package version tracking and management.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ = version) and the version tuple assignment (__version_tuple__ = version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flow to untrusted sources or outputs that could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only assigns static variables and does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING to conditionally import typing hints is standard practice; no unusual or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains static assignments for version information and a conditional import for type hints. It is generated by a build tool (setuptools_scm). No dynamic execution, input handling, or network activity is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code is straightforward and follows common versioning conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard snippet generated during package build/versioning. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
