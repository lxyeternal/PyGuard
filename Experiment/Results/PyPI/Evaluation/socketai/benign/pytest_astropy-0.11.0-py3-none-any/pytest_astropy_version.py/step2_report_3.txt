  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a straightforward, auto-generated snippet by `setuptools_scm`.\n   - It assigns static version information (`__version__`, `version`, `__version_tuple__`, `version_tuple`).\n   - It conditionally imports `Tuple` from `typing` when `TYPE_CHECKING` is `True`.\n   - There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, network calls, or data flows.\n   - No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Evaluation:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that this is standard package metadata code.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior are detected.\n   - The code is consistent with typical versioning practices in Python packages.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; the code contains no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`. The code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign `0`. No security vulnerabilities or risks are evident.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; no corrections needed.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as benign and auto-generated.\n   - The reasoning is sound, with no assumptions that lead to false positives.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores?**\n   - No. The scores align well with the code's nature.\n   - Assigning higher risk scores would be unjustified given the benign nature.\n\n6. **Summary and Final Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, auto-generated version metadata snippet.\n   - No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risky elements are present.\n   - The reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is entirely benign and typical for package versioning.",
