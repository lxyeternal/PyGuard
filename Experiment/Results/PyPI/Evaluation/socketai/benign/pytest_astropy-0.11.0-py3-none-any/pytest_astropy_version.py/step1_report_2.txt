{
  "purpose": "Define version information for the package generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuple, conditional import based on TYPE_CHECKING.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Simple assignment flows, no external data flow or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and auto-generated by setuptools_scm, which manages versioning. It conditionally imports typing information for static analysis tools when TYPE_CHECKING is true, and assigns version information as string and tuple constants. No suspicious or malicious behavior, no external data handling or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package metadata initialization with no signs of malicious intent.",
