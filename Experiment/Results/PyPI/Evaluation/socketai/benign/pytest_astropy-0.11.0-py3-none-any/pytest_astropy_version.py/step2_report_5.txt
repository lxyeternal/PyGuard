  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a minimal, auto-generated version file created by setuptools_scm.\n   - It assigns static version information to variables (`__version__`, `version`, `__version_tuple__`, `version_tuple`).\n   - It conditionally imports `Tuple` from `typing` when `TYPE_CHECKING` is true.\n   - There are no dynamic inputs, network calls, or data processing.\n   - The code contains a comment indicating it is auto-generated, which is typical for such files.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious payloads.\n   - No external data handling or execution.\n   - The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` is standard for type hints and does not introduce security risks.\n   - The code is static and straightforward.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Report:**\n   - All reports consistently describe the code as benign, auto-generated, and standard for version management.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 is correct; there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 is correct; the code poses no security risk.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume the code is auto-generated and benign, which aligns with the content.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code does not process untrusted data or perform risky operations.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, benign version information snippet.\n   - The scores are reasonable and justified.\n   - No modifications needed.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, auto-generated version file with no malicious or security concerns. The reports correctly identify it as benign, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
