  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and version tuple, conditional import for type checking",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external outputs",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Use of a conditional import based on TYPE_CHECKING; no malicious or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code sets version variables and conditionally imports typing information for static analysis. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic execution, no network activity, or other suspicious code. The presence of a version string and tuple is standard in package metadata. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration snippet used for package metadata. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior.",
