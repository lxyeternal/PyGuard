  "purpose": "To define version metadata for the package, including version string and tuple, with support for type hints.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version variables; conditional import for type hints.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assignments with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, auto-generated code with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, auto-generated version info snippet created by setuptools_scm. It assigns static version strings and tuples, and conditionally imports 'Tuple' for type hints. There are no dynamic inputs, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. The code's purpose is solely to provide version metadata. All signals indicate benign, standard practice code with no security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version metadata snippet with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
