{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string '__version__' and version tuple '__version_tuple__'. No external input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points present.",
  "flows": "Direct assignment of version variables; no flow from external sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains a comment indicating it is auto-generated by setuptools_scm; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets version-related variables for package metadata. The only dynamic aspect is the assignment of version information, which is hardcoded as a string and tuple. There are no external data inputs, no code execution, no network activity, nor sensitive data handling. The presence of a comment indicates it is auto-generated, which is typical for such files. No security risks or malicious activity evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated version metadata definition with no malicious intent or security risks.",
