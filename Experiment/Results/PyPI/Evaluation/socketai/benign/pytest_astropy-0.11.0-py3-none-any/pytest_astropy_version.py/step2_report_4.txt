  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Code Content Overview:**\n- The code assigns static version information to variables (`__version__`, `version`, `__version_tuple__`, `version_tuple`).\n- It uses a conditional import (`if TYPE_CHECKING:`) for type hints, which is standard practice.\n- The code is auto-generated by `setuptools_scm`.\n- There are no dynamic inputs, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, dynamic data flow, or security risks.\n- The version variables are static and straightforward.\n- No external data sources or sinks are involved.\n- The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` is standard and harmless.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical or security flaws are evident.\n- The code is simple, auto-generated, and intended solely for version metadata.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign `0`. The code is benign.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?** Yes. The code is standard, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, so all scores are appropriate.\n- **Are there any assumptions that could be challenged?** No. The reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- **Is there any overlooked security concern?** No. The code is purely static metadata.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\nGiven all reports and the code content, I agree with the provided scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**This code is entirely benign, with no security issues.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version metadata snippet.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the assessment aligns with the code's nature.",
