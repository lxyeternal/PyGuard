{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and includes type checking conditionals.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns static values to variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; variables are statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The only conditional is for type checking, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward version definition snippet generated by setuptools_scm. It sets version strings and tuples, uses a conditional import for type checking, and includes comments indicating its autogenerated nature. There are no signs of malicious code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior. The structure is typical for a version file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version information file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
