  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard pytest configuration script.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, network activity, or external data handling is present.\n- The code's purpose is solely to manage test execution flow based on user-provided command-line options and test markers.\n- The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code; all reports confirm benign behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified; the code uses standard pytest APIs appropriately.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n  - **Risk score:** 0, as there's no security risk or malicious activity.\n\n**Justification for risk and malware scores:**\n- The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, code injection, or other malicious activities.\n- It is purely for test management, which does not pose a security threat.\n\n**Potential concerns or assumptions:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is standard configuration.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign pytest extension for managing test execution based on user options. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI concur with the reports' assessments. The code poses no security threat, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
