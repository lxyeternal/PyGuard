  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Logic**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code adds custom command-line options (`--run-slow`, `--run-hugemem`, `-R`) to control test execution in pytest. The functions `pytest_addoption`, `pytest_configure`, and `pytest_collection_modifyitems` are used to set options, register markers, and modify test collection to skip or run tests based on user input. The logic is straightforward and standard for pytest configuration.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks**  \n- No report mentions any code that processes untrusted data in a malicious way, performs network activity, writes to sensitive locations, or executes code that could be exploited.  \n- The code does not handle external data beyond command-line options, nor does it perform any file or network operations.  \n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \n- The code appears correct and idiomatic for pytest plugin development.  \n- The markers and options are well-defined, and the skipping logic is standard.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate. There is no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code controls test execution but does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities; all are cautious and accurate.\n\n6. **Consistency & Reasonableness of Scores**  \n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (code is clear and standard)  \n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional Notes:**  \nGiven the nature of this code, it is purely a configuration extension for pytest, intended to control test execution based on user flags. There are no indications of supply chain security threats, malware, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nThe current scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, benign, and well-understood.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
