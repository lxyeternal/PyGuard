  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**1. Presence of malicious code or security risks:**  \nAll reports consistently indicate that the code is a straightforward pytest configuration script. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, network communication, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. The code only adds command-line options and markers to control test execution flow.\n\n**2. Logical correctness and potential flaws:**  \nThe logic for adding options, configuring markers, and skipping tests based on user input is standard and correct. No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security vulnerabilities are identified. The code is well-structured and aligns with typical pytest plugin patterns.\n\n**3. Malware and obfuscation scores:**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. Obfuscation is also scored 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and readable.\n\n**4. Risk assessment:**  \nSince the code does not perform any harmful actions, the overall security risk is zero. The purpose is solely to manage test execution, which is common in testing frameworks.\n\n**5. Consistency of scores:**  \nThe reports uniformly rate malware, obfuscated code, and security risk as zero, which is justified. The confidence scores are high (1), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**6. Any claims based on assumptions:**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent. They correctly interpret the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard pytest configuration script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. It only manages test execution flags and markers, which is typical and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. No modifications are necessary. The code is safe, benign, and unrelated to supply chain security threats.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n- Confirm the code's benign intent and standard functionality.\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0",
