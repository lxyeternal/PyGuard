{
  "purpose": "This code adds custom command-line options and markers for pytest to control the execution of slow and memory-intensive tests.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (--run-slow, --run-hugemem, -R) and test item keywords (slow, hugemem).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks or security effects are present.",
  "flows": "User provides command-line options → pytest configuration adds markers → test collection modifies test items based on options.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behaviors detected. The code strictly manages test execution flow without any hidden or malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and defines functions to add command-line options and configure test collection behavior. It introduces options for running slow and memory-heavy tests and a remote data option. During test collection, tests marked with 'slow' or 'hugemem' are conditionally skipped unless corresponding flags are provided. There is no dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or external connections involved. The code appears standard and designed solely for test management purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign pytest setup script for managing test execution. It contains no malicious or suspicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, or malware indicators.",
