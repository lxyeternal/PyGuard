  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a version string from a local module and assigns it to __version__. There are no input handling, data processing, or network operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The license comment is standard for open-source packages. The code appears to be a typical version declaration file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to expose the package version. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
