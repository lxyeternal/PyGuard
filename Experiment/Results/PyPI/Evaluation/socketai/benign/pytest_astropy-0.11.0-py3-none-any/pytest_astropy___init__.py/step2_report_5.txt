  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple import of a version string from a local module (.version).\n- The code is minimal, standard for package versioning.\n- No external input, data flow, or network operations are involved.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are noted.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature described.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code snippets in all reports are consistent with the provided \"Original Code.\"\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain any malicious payloads.\n- The license comment is standard and not suspicious.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.\n- The only possible concern could be if the `.version` module is malicious or compromised. However, this is outside the scope of the provided code snippet and reports.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reasoning in all reports is sound and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores based on the provided information.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
