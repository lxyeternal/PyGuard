  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple import of a version string from a local module (.version).\n- No external input, network operations, or data processing are involved.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is indicated.\n- The code appears to be a standard pattern in Python packaging for version management.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, malware score of 0, and security risk of 0, which seems appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed facts:\n- The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement.\n- The purpose is to expose package version information.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n- The license comment is standard and not suspicious.\n\n### Potential issues or concerns:\n- Since all reports agree, and the code is straightforward, there is no indication of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- The only minor point is that the code depends on a local module `.version`, but this is a common pattern, not inherently suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations on scores:\n- **Malware score:** Remains at 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remains at 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Remains at 0, as the code does not introduce any security concerns.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security issues.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their evaluation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe initial scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is a standard, benign version declaration pattern with no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.",
