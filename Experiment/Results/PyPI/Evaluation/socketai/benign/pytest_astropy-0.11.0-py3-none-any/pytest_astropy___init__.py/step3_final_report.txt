  "purpose": "To define and expose the package version information by importing the version string from a local module.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .version import version as __version__",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks exists in this code",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern in Python packages for version management, importing a version string from a local module. It involves no external inputs, network operations, or data processing. The code is clear, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and standard practice support the conclusion that it poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
