  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple import of a version string from a local module (.version).\n- The code is minimal, with no data processing, network operations, or untrusted input handling.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The license comment is standard and does not suggest malicious intent.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1 and malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores of 0.\n\n**Confirming code issues:**\n- The code snippets are consistent across reports and match the original code provided.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- The import is static and from a local module, which is typical for version management.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**\n- No errors or flawed reasoning are evident; all reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- The reasoning is sound, based on the minimal and straightforward code.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware score: all reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score: all assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- Security risk: all assign 0, appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the reports correctly avoid speculation.\n- The code is standard for version management, with no indication of hidden malicious intent.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward version import with no security issues.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No security concerns or malicious behavior are present.",
