  "purpose": "The code imports version information from a local module, likely for package version management.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing __version__ from a local module (.version).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs; no untrusted data is handled.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; import is a static operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; minimal code with a license comment and a single import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a license comment indicating open-source licensing. It then imports the version string from a local module, which is a standard practice for version management in Python packages. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or unusual behavior. The code does not process or handle any untrusted input or perform any network or file operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a typical purpose of version management within a package. No malicious or security-related issues are present.",
