{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for generating URLs, locating binaries, and managing Chrome/Chromedriver versions across different platforms.",
  "sources": "Reads platform information, environment variables ('PATH'), version strings, and URL responses.",
  "sinks": "Potential URL fetches (network requests), subprocess calls for version detection, file system checks for binary existence, and environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Reads platform and environment info to determine URLs and file paths; fetches JSON data from the internet; executes system commands to check versions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behavior observed. Use of subprocess for version detection is standard; no obfuscated or misleading code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs platform detection, constructs URLs for downloading ChromeDriver, and searches for binaries in system paths. It fetches JSON data from reputable sources for ChromeDriver versions, and runs subprocess commands to identify browser versions. All network and subprocess operations are for legitimate version management and binary discovery. No evidence of data exfiltration, malicious backdoors, or hidden behaviors. The code appears to be a utility module with standard practices for browser driver management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility module for managing ChromeDriver and Chrome versions across platforms. It performs network requests, subprocess calls, and file system checks in a transparent manner. No malicious behavior or sabotage is detected. The code is well-structured for its purpose, with no suspicious anomalies.",
