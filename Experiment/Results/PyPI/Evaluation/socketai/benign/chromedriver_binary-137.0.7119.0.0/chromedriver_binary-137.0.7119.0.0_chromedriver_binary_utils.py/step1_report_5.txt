  "purpose": "Helper functions for generating URLs, locating binaries, and managing Chrome/Chromedriver versions.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (PATH), system commands (subprocess), URLs for version info, system platform info.",
  "sinks": "Potential URL fetches for version data and downloads, subprocess calls to check browser versions, file system access to locate binaries.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> URL fetch (version info) -> subprocess output (browser version) -> binary path verification",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious URL manipulation beyond legitimate download links. Use of subprocess for version detection is standard. No hidden backdoors or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign tasks such as generating download URLs for ChromeDriver based on platform, fetching version info from known URLs, and locating binaries in PATH. URL fetches are limited to official or well-known sources for ChromeDriver and Chrome version info, with no indications of data exfiltration or malicious payloads. subprocess calls are used for version detection, which is common in such utilities. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malware activities. The overall structure aligns with legitimate helper functions for managing ChromeDriver and Chrome versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility library for managing ChromeDriver and Chrome browser versions, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It relies on official sources and standard system commands, with no indicators of malware or supply chain attacks.",
