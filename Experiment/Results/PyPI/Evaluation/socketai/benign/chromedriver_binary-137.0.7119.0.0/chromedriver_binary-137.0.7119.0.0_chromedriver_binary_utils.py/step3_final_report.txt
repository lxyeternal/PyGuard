  "purpose": "Helper functions for filename and URL generation, platform detection, and ChromeDriver management.",
  "sources": "Network requests to URLs for version info and download links; subprocess calls to detect browser versions; environment variables for PATH.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of subprocess commands; reading environment variables; network data fetching.",
  "flows": "Source: URL fetches and subprocess outputs; Sink: subprocess execution and environment variable access.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs platform detection, URL generation, binary path searches, and version checks using standard methods. Network requests are to legitimate sources related to ChromeDriver and Chrome versions. Subprocess calls are typical for version detection. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.2) are consistent with the benign, standard behavior of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing ChromeDriver and Chrome browser versions. It does not contain malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The network interactions are with trusted sources, and subprocess calls are standard. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be 0, aligning with the analysis.",
