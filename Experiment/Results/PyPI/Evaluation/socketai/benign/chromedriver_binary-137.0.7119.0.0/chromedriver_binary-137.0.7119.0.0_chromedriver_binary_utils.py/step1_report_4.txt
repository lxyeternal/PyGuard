{
  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for generating URLs, locating binaries, and managing ChromeDriver versions for browser automation tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('PATH'), network responses from multiple URLs, subprocess outputs for browser versions, and the script's own file location.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external URLs, subprocess commands for version detection, and file system checks for binary existence and executability.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and network responses supply URLs and version info; subprocess outputs provide browser version details; get_chromedriver_url fetches URLs based on platform and version.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to check browser versions may be exploited if manipulated; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no obfuscated or malicious code detected; external URLs used are standard for ChromeDriver management.",
  "analysis": "The script performs platform detection, URL generation for ChromeDriver downloads, and binary location searches. It fetches data from trusted URLs for version info and uses subprocess calls for browser version detection. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors observed. The network requests are for legitimate ChromeDriver management, and subprocess calls are standard for version checks. No indications of obfuscated code or malicious data exfiltration. Overall, the code appears benign and purpose-driven, focused on automating ChromeDriver management tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard helper module for managing ChromeDriver and browser versions, with no malicious intent detected. It relies on network resources for version info and performs system checks in a typical manner. No security risks or malware behaviors identified.",
