  "purpose": "Helper functions for detecting, downloading, and locating ChromeDriver binaries for browser automation across different platforms.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PATH), system commands ('--version' calls), network requests to URLs providing version data and download links, and system platform information.",
  "sinks": "URL opening via urlopen, subprocess calls to check browser versions, and file system access to locate binaries and verify executability.",
  "flows": "Input data from environment variables, system commands, and URL responses flow into decision logic and return values; network responses influence URL generation; subprocess output informs version checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Use of network requests to external domains (chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com, googlechromelabs.github.io) is expected for version management. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles platform-specific binary filename retrieval, URL generation for ChromeDriver downloads, and version checking. It includes functions for querying external URLs to get latest versions and download URLs, searching PATH for existing binaries, and verifying installed browser versions via subprocess calls. These operations are standard for automation tools. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The network requests are to legitimate, publicly documented domains for ChromeDriver and Chrome version info, aligning with intended functionality. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code injections, or obfuscated code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for managing ChromeDriver binaries across platforms, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs version and path detection, download URL generation, and verification without harmful side-effects.",
