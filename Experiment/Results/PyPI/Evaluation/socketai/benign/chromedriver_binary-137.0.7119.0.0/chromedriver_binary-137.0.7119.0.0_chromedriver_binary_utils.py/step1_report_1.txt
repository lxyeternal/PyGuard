  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for generating URLs, locating, and managing chromedriver binaries across different platforms and versions.",
  "sources": "User environment variables (PATH), platform information, version parameters, system commands for browser version detection.",
  "sinks": "URL requests via urlopen, subprocess calls to get browser versions, and reading environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> URL construction and system commands; Version info -> URL requests and subprocess outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.check_output for version detection could be exploited if malicious binaries are present; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed; URL fetching is dynamic but standard for this purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically generates URLs for chromedriver downloads based on system platform, architecture, and version, making network requests to trusted sources. It searches the system PATH for binaries, executes commands to determine browser versions, and retrieves version info from URLs. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network behavior (beyond expected URL fetches) are detected. The code performs standard system and network interactions typical for a package managing driver downloads and system checks. No malicious activity, backdoors, or malware signatures are apparent. The use of subprocess to call browsers could potentially be exploited if malicious browsers or binaries are installed, but this is a normal system check.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for managing chromedriver binaries across platforms. It uses system calls and URL requests in an expected manner for such tasks. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware are detected. The network and subprocess interactions are typical for this use case. Overall, the code appears safe with no security risks identified.",
