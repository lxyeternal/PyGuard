  "purpose": "Add the chromedriver binary's directory to the system PATH environment variable to make it accessible system-wide.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), utils.get_chromedriver_filename(), os.environ['PATH']",
  "sinks": "os.environ['PATH'] modification, os.environ['PATH'] assignment",
  "flows": "Read directory of current file -> Append directory to PATH environment variable",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external network calls, no obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves its own directory path and the chromedriver filename using a utility module. It then modifies the PATH environment variable at runtime to include this directory, facilitating the executable's discovery. The environment variable is handled carefully, checking for existing 'PATH' entries and appending appropriately. The code appears straightforward and intended solely for environment configuration without any data leakage or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply modifies the system environment to include a specific directory for the chromedriver executable. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or backdoors. It appears to be a benign setup script to ensure the chromedriver binary is accessible.",
