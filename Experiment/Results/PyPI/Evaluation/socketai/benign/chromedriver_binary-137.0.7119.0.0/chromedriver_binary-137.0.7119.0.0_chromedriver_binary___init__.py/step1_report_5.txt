  "purpose": "Add the chromedriver executable's directory to the system PATH environment variable to ensure it can be found and executed.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.path.dirname, os.environ['PATH'], utils.get_variable_separator(), utils.get_chromedriver_filename()",
  "sinks": "os.environ['PATH'] modification",
  "flows": "Read the directory of the current file -> check and modify 'PATH' environment variable to include chromedriver directory",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious modifications, no obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns. Reliance on external 'utils' functions without context could be benign or risky, but nothing suspicious is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code computes the directory of the current script and appends it to the 'PATH' environment variable if not already present, using a separator obtained from a utility function. The filename for chromedriver is constructed based on the directory and a utility-provided filename. The code's intent appears to be to ensure the chromedriver binary can be easily invoked from the command line or subprocesses. There are no indicators of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, remote control, or obfuscation. The use of external utilities is typical in packaging or setup scripts; their behavior is unknown but not inherently malicious. Overall, the code performs a benign environment modification without any evident security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup utility to modify the PATH environment variable for chromedriver. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It appears to be part of a normal installation or setup process.",
