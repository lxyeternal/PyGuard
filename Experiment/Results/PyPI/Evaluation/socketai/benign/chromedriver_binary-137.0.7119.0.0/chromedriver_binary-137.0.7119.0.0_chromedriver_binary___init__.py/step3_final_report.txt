  "purpose": "The code adds the directory containing the chromedriver executable to the system's PATH environment variable at runtime to ensure it can be invoked easily.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own directory via os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)), and retrieves the chromedriver filename via utils.get_chromedriver_filename().",
  "sinks": "The code modifies os.environ['PATH'], affecting subprocesses spawned after execution, to include the chromedriver directory.",
  "flows": "Source: os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)) and utils.get_chromedriver_filename() -> sink: os.environ['PATH'] modification.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a straightforward environment setup without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script determines its own directory, retrieves the chromedriver filename via utility functions, and appends this directory to the PATH environment variable if not already present. This is a common setup step to facilitate locating the chromedriver executable. The code does not perform any network activity, handle credentials, or contain obfuscated code. It modifies the environment only for the current process and subprocesses, with no persistent system-wide changes. Utility functions are external but assumed benign based on context. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup utility that modifies the environment to include the chromedriver directory. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports correctly assess its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and very low security risk scores (~0.1). The overall assessment aligns with the code's straightforward purpose.",
