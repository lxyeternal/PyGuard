{
  "purpose": "The code aims to add the directory of the chromedriver executable to the system's PATH environment variable.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current script's directory (__file__), environment variables (os.environ), and possibly a variable from utils.get_variable_separator() and utils.get_chromedriver_filename().",
  "sinks": "Modifies the 'PATH' environment variable within the process's environment (os.environ), affecting subsequent subprocesses spawned by this process.",
  "flows": "Reads __file__ and utils functions to determine the directory and filename; updates os.environ['PATH'] accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. No external network connections or data leaks are present. The code simply modifies environment variables locally.",
  "analysis": "The script computes the directory of the current file, retrieves the chromedriver filename via a utility function, and appends this directory to the PATH environment variable if not already present. The purpose appears to facilitate locating chromedriver without requiring user setup. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications beyond environment variable adjustment. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. It is a typical setup utility, with no malicious intent or malicious code. The only potential concern is modifying environment variables, but this is standard in setup scripts and does not constitute malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup utility intended to facilitate chromedriver execution by adding its directory to PATH. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. It does not pose security risks.",
