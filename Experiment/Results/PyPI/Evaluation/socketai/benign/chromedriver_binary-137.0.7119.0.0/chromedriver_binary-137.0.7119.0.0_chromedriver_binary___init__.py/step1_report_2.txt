  "purpose": "Add the chromedriver executable's directory to the system PATH environment variable to ensure it is accessible.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), utils.get_variable_separator(), os.environ (for reading and modifying PATH)",
  "sinks": "os.environ['PATH'] (modification of system environment variables)",
  "flows": "Retrieve current directory of the script -> Append directory to PATH environment variable -> No external untrusted data flows observed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The code simply modifies environment variables based on local file paths.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to add the directory containing the script to the system PATH environment variable, facilitating access to the chromedriver binary. It constructs the path to the chromedriver filename using utility functions. The environment variable 'PATH' is read and conditionally modified to include the directory, ensuring the chromedriver can be found by other processes. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are involved. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign task of updating the PATH environment variable to include the chromedriver directory. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
