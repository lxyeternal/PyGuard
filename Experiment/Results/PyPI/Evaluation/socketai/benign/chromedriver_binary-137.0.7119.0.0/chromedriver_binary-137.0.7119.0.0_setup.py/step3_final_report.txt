{
  "purpose": "This code manages downloading, verifying, and installing a specific version of ChromeDriver, including version checks, extraction, and setting executable permissions.",
  "sources": "Network request via get_chromedriver_url(), filesystem reads/writes for existing binaries, version checks, and extraction from ZIP archive.",
  "sinks": "Writing files to disk, changing file permissions, and network download; no untrusted code execution or data exfiltration detected.",
  "flows": "Source: URL obtained from get_chromedriver_url() -> Response read -> ZIP extraction -> Filesystem write and permission change.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flows; standard library usage and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The script performs expected operations for a setup utility: checking existing binaries, downloading if necessary, extracting, and setting permissions. It uses secure SSL context for network requests, handles errors gracefully, and does not execute untrusted code. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The external URL dependency is typical for such tools but represents a trust point rather than malicious intent. The code's clarity and standard practices indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured installer script for ChromeDriver with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only inherent risk relates to external URL trust, which is standard for such utilities. Overall, the code is safe and the security scores should reflect minimal risk.",
