{
  "purpose": "The code automates the download, extraction, and installation of a specific version of ChromeDriver, including checking for existing binaries and setting executable permissions.",
  "sources": "Reads from local filesystem ('README.md', directory checks), network (urlopen to download chromedriver archive), environment variables (not explicitly used), and file permissions (os.access, os.chmod).",
  "sinks": "Writes files to the filesystem (downloaded archive extraction, renamed files, setting executable permissions).",
  "flows": "Downloads chromedriver archive from a URL, extracts it to a directory, and updates filesystem permissions; no untrusted user input is used in these flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or unusual control flows observed. The code performs expected tasks for package setup and binary management.",
  "analysis": "The script handles the download and installation of chromedriver binaries, including version checks and permission setting, with exception handling for network errors. It utilizes standard libraries and a third-party utility. There are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, command injection, or covert backdoors. The code interacts with local filesystem and network resources solely for its intended purpose. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for managing chromedriver binaries without any malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected functions with proper error handling and safe practices. No malware signals or security threats are detected.",
