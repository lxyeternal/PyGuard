{
  "purpose": "To download, verify, and install a specific version of the chromedriver binary for use with Selenium or other automation tools.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, calling get_chromedriver_filename(), get_chromedriver_url(), find_binary_in_path(), check_version(), and network request via urlopen.",
  "sinks": "Network request to download chromedriver archive, file system operations (saving, renaming, setting permissions), and reading local files.",
  "flows": "Code reads local files and environment (e.g., existing binaries, version checks) -> network request to download binary -> saves/extracts binary to filesystem -> sets executable permissions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code downloads and executes external content, but only from a controlled URL obtained via get_chromedriver_url(). No obfuscated or misleading code features detected. No backdoors or hidden behaviors evident.",
  "analysis": "The script manages downloading and installing a specific chromedriver version by checking existing binaries and versions locally. It uses standard libraries for network access, file handling, and subprocess management. All external URLs are obtained via functions presumed to return legitimate sources. The code performs file permission adjustments. No evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The only potentially risky behavior is network access to external URLs, but this is consistent with its purpose. The code does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate installer for chromedriver, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It correctly manages downloads, version checks, and file permissions, aligned with its purpose. No malware indicators or security risks are evident.",
