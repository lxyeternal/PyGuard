{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to download, install, and manage the chromedriver binary for Selenium testing automation.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file; fetches URL for chromedriver; inspects environment PATH; reads response data from URL",
  "sinks": "Writes files to the filesystem; modifies file permissions; unzips downloaded archive; renames files; potentially executes system commands via os and zipfile modules",
  "flows": "Reads URL to download chromedriver -> saves archive to disk -> extracts files -> sets executable permissions -> copies files into project directory",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard libraries for network access and file operations without obfuscation; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code; no dynamic code execution; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages the download and setup of chromedriver binaries. It performs network requests to fetch the driver archive, extracts it, and sets permissions. It includes checks for existing binaries and their versions. The code appears standard, with no indications of malicious activity. The operations are typical for setup scripts and do not contain any hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup utility for managing chromedriver binaries. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or malware indications. No security risks are evident beyond normal file and network operations involved in software setup.",
