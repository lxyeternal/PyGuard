  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code downloads and manages chromedriver binaries via URL requests and filesystem checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows; mainly network I/O and filesystem modifications.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code performs expected tasks.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9); no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code is a standard installer with no malicious behavior. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar to above.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows; standard download and filesystem operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; external URL obtained via controlled function.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9); no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasoning is consistent. The security risk score of 0.2 might be slightly conservative but acceptable given the external download aspect.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious flows; standard download and extraction.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or suspicious URL handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9); no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-reasoned. The minimal security risk score reflects the external download but is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious activity; standard filesystem and network operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9); no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows; straightforward download and setup.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or hidden behaviors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (1.0); no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk Scores:** Mostly low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the standard download/setup process.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity present.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to external download dependency, which is expected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. The code is a standard, safe installer script with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
