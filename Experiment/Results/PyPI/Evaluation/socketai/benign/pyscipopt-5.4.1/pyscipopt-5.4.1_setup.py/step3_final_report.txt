  "purpose": "Build configuration script for setting up the Python interface to SCIP, involving environment detection, filesystem checks, and extension compilation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (SCIPOPTDIR, GITHUB_ACTIONS, RELEASE), filesystem paths, command-line arguments, and package files.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit(), print statements, setup() function, filesystem access, environment variable reads.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and filesystem checks influence build paths and compilation flags; command-line args modify build options.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Standard build script behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection, filesystem validation, and conditional compilation setup typical for extension modules. No network activity, no data leaks, no malicious code. Use of sys.exit() and print() are standard for setup scripts. Environment variables are used for configuration, which is common but should be trusted; no untrusted input processing or code injection present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard build configuration for a Python extension interfacing with SCIP. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
