  "purpose": "The function analyzes a given optimization model to identify infeasible constraints by adding slack and binary variables, and then minimizes the number of infeasible constraints.",
  "sources": "The code reads the original model's constraints via 'orig_model.getConss()' and the model's current variable values during optimization with 'model.getVal()'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are 'model.getVal(binary[c])' which reads variable values after optimization; no external data output or network activity is present.",
  "flows": "Constraints are added to the model, then the model is optimized; the binary variables indicate infeasibilities, and their values are checked after optimization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are observed. The code performs standard infeasibility analysis. No suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscation present. The verbose print statements are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code clones an input model, adds slack and binary variables to each constraint to detect infeasibility, and minimizes the total infeasibility count. It uses standard modeling techniques without external data leaks or malicious actions. No suspicious network or file system activities are involved. The use of auxiliary variables and SOS constraints is typical for infeasibility analysis. No signs of obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a legitimate constraint infeasibility analysis without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It only manipulates and inspects the optimization model to identify infeasible constraints. No malicious code, malware, or security risks are present.",
