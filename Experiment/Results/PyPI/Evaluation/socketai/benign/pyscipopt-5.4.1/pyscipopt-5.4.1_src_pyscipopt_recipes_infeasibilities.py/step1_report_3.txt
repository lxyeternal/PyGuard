  "purpose": "The function analyzes a given optimization model to identify infeasible constraints by adding slack and binary variables, then minimizing the sum of these binary variables.",
  "sources": "Reads from the original model’s constraints via getConss() and getVal() methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies the model with added variables and constraints; outputs diagnostic print statements.",
  "flows": "Model constraints are augmented with slack and auxiliary variables; objective function is set; model is optimized; results are interpreted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code straightforwardly manipulates an optimization model without hidden data leaks or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a deep copy of an existing optimization model and adds slack, auxiliary, and binary variables to each constraint to identify infeasibility. It uses established modeling techniques for constraint relaxation and infeasibility detection. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The print statements are diagnostic and do not pose security risks. Usage of the PySCIPOpt library is standard for optimization tasks. No obfuscation or malicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility function for infeasibility analysis within an optimization model. It does not contain malicious intent or malware. Its purpose is to assist in diagnosing infeasible constraints, with no evident security risks.",
