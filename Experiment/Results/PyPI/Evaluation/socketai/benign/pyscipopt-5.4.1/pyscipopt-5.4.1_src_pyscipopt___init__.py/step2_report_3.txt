  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a straightforward setup script that:\n  - Reads an environment variable (`SCIPOPTDIR`)\n  - Conditionally adds a DLL directory on Windows\n  - Imports numerous classes and functions from the `pyscipopt` library\n  - Exposes these objects for external use\n- None of the reports identify suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- All reports assign high confidence (mostly 0.9 or 1.0) that the code is benign.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0.1 or 0.2).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are evident in the code. The environment variable is used only to adjust DLL loading paths, which is standard practice.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or write to sensitive locations.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's benign nature, a low risk score (~0.1) is justified.\n\n### Any inconsistencies or suggestions:\n- The reports are consistent with each other.\n- The high confidence scores are justified based on the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The environment variable usage is safe and typical.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** (due to environment variable handling, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard setup script for a Python package interfacing with the `pyscipopt` optimization library. It performs environment configuration and imports, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like a detailed explanation or any further analysis?**",
