  "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect the security posture of the code snippets. Reports with obfuscation and suspicious patterns (notably Report 2) are correctly scored with higher malware and obfuscation levels. Benign reports are appropriately scored low. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the described findings, indicating moderate overall risk with specific areas of concern."
