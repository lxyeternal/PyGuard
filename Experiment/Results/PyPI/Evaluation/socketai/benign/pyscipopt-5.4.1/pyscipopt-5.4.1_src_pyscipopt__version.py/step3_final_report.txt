  "purpose": "Assign a version string to __version__ in a Python package.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a simple string assignment.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; straightforward assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal assignment of a version string to __version__, with no inputs, outputs, data flows, or executable logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious or security concerns. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the code's simplicity. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0). No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
