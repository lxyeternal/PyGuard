  "purpose": "Defines the version string of a Python module or package.",
  "sources": "The code itself does not read any external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code is a simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, containing only a version string assignment. No suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward assignment of a version string to a variable '__version__'. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be a standard way of defining package versioning in Python projects. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and typical for Python package version declaration. No malicious behavior or security issues identified.",
