  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is simply assigning a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or executable logic.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are detected.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and contains no malicious or security-related issues.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as a standard version assignment.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 or 0.0\n     - `malware`: 0 or 0.0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is justified.\n   - The code contains no malicious activity, no external data handling, and no obfuscation.\n   - **Conclusion:** No justification for higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Analysis:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No questionable assumptions are made; all analyses are accurate.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies or contradictions are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, standard version string assignment.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate, correctly reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe entire set of reports correctly identifies the code as harmless. No adjustments to scores are necessary. The overall security posture of this code snippet is excellent, with zero malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
