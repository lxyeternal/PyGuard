{
  "purpose": "Defines a function to set a nonlinear objective in a PySCIPOpt model using an epigraph reformulation.",
  "sources": "Imports from pyscipopt, use of function parameters (model, expr, sense), and internal variable creation.",
  "sinks": "Model's addVar, addCons, setMinimize, setMaximize methods, which modify the optimization model.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (model, expr, sense) influence calls to addVar, addCons, setMinimize/setMaximize, which modify the model's state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. No suspicious code or hidden mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that creates a new variable and adds constraints based on the nonlinear expression to perform an epigraph reformulation. The assertions and conditional logic are standard. No signs of malicious data handling or malicious code. The import is from a legitimate library, and the overall structure is typical for modeling code. No suspicious data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of a nonlinear objective setting function in an optimization context. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
