{
  "purpose": "The function sets a nonlinear objective in a PySCIPOpt model using an epigraph reformulation.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'model' (PySCIPOpt Model), input parameter 'expr' (expression object), 'sense' (string for optimization direction).",
  "sinks": "The code creates variables and adds constraints to the model, which could potentially be misused to manipulate the optimization process.",
  "flows": "Expression 'expr' is used to define constraints involving 'new_obj' variable, then the model's objective is set based on 'sense'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. No external data or network activity present. The use of 'assert' and custom variables is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that reformulates a nonlinear objective into a linear form using an epigraph approach. It creates a new variable and adds constraints accordingly. No input validation beyond assertion, no suspicious or malicious logic observed. The code operates solely within the optimization modeling context, with no external data handling or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a nonlinear objective reformulation in an optimization model. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
