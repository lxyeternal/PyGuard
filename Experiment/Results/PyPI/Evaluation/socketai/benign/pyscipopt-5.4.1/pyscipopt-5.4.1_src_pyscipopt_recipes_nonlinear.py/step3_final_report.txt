{
  "purpose": "Provides an epigraph reformulation for a nonlinear expression within a PySCIPOpt model by adding a new variable and constraints, then setting the optimization sense.",
  "sources": "The expression 'expr' used in the constraint and the 'sense' parameter indicating 'minimize' or 'maximize'.",
  "sinks": "The added variable 'new_obj' and the constraints involving 'expr' and 'new_obj' which influence the model's objective.",
  "flows": "Input 'expr' flows into the constraint 'expr <= or >= new_obj', which then influences the model's objective setting.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and standard for modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard nonlinear reformulation by adding a new variable and constraints based on the nonlinear expression. It asserts the expression's degree to ensure nonlinearity, then modifies the model accordingly. No external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The logic is clear, well-structured, and uses standard modeling practices. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are identified. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for nonlinear reformulation in optimization modeling. It shows no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
