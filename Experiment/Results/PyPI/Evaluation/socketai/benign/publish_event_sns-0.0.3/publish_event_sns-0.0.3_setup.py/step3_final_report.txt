  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project, defining metadata and package data.",
  "sources": "Imports from os and setuptools modules; reading README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file operations beyond standard setup.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; setup parameters are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script with no suspicious or malicious constructs. It imports necessary modules, defines package metadata, and calls setup() with standard arguments. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network activity is present. The reports are empty, providing no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The code does not handle untrusted input or perform insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard packaging code with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The empty reports suggest no issues were found or reported. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is minimal.",
