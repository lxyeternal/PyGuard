  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code only assigns a string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic behaviors, or code patterns indicative of malicious activity.  \n   **Conclusion:** No malicious code is present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is standard, minimal, and free of anomalies or suspicious patterns. The code's simplicity means it's unlikely to contain errors or flaws.\n\n3. **Score Justification and Consistency:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, as the code is straightforward and human-readable.  \n   - **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity is detected or implied.  \n   - **Security risk score (0):** Correct, no security issues are present.\n\n4. **Risk Score Analysis:**  \n   The risk score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions and Claims:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a standard version declaration.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code snippet and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Justification:\n\nGiven the simplicity of the code, the absence of any dynamic or external behaviors, and the consensus across all reports, these scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concerns. The current scoring accurately reflects this assessment.",
