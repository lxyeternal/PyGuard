{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, serving as a version indicator for the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment setting __version__ to '0.8.5'. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors. The code is a standard practice in Python packages for versioning. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are detected. The simplicity and static nature of the code confirm its benign intent. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, reflecting the harmless nature of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concerns. The scores assigned are accurate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
