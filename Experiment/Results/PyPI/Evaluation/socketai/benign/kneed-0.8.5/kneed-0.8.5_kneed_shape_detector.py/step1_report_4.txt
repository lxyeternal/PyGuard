  "purpose": "Analyze and determine the direction and curve type of a line based on input data points.",
  "sources": "np.polyfit and np.mean functions operating on input arrays x and y.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code performs computations without external or sensitive data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input arrays x and y are processed through polyfit and mean calculations to produce output labels.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code fits a linear polynomial to the data, then evaluates the mean difference between y-values and the fitted line over a specific interval to classify the shape. It relies solely on numpy functions and straightforward calculations, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility function for data analysis without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
