  "purpose": "The function analyzes input data points to determine the line's direction and curvature.",
  "sources": "Reads input arrays 'x' and 'y', and performs computations with numpy functions such as np.polyfit and np.mean.",
  "sinks": "Returns string labels; no direct sinks involving external data or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input arrays are processed to fit a polynomial, then statistical measures are computed to determine shape characteristics.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses numpy to fit a linear polynomial to data points and then analyzes the slope ('p[0]') and mean differences ('q') to determine direction and curve type. The approach appears straightforward, with no complex or hidden behaviors. No external network access, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are present. The logic is consistent with a data analysis task, and all operations are typical for such purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data analysis function without malicious intent. It performs straightforward computations to identify line characteristics. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
