  "purpose": "To analyze the trend and curvature of a line based on input data points using polynomial fitting.",
  "sources": "The input data arrays 'x' and 'y' passed to the 'find_shape' function.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only performs calculations and returns a string indicating shape and curve type.",
  "flows": "Input data is used in np.polyfit and numpy operations to compute slope and mean values, which inform the return values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code. The logic appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs polynomial fitting of degree 1 on input arrays 'x' and 'y'. It then computes indices at 20% and 80% of the data length, calculates the mean of 'y' over this segment, and compares it to the mean of the fitted line over the same segment. Based on the sign of the slope ('p[0]') and the value of 'q', it classifies the line as increasing/decreasing and concave/convex. The logic is simple and focused solely on data analysis; no malicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data analysis function with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. It simply fits a line and classifies its shape.",
