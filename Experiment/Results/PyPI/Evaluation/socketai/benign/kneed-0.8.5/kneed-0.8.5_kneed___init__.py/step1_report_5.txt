  "purpose": "Import statements for modules and functions used in a larger Python package.",
  "sources": "Module imports from local package files: data_generator, knee_locator, shape_detector, and version information.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file, or environment variable access are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements referencing local modules within the package. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is observable. The version import suggests version tracking but does not pose a security risk. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module initialization file. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package import statements with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is a straightforward setup for module imports in a Python package.",
