  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of the scores, and any potential inconsistencies.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of straightforward import statements from local modules. There is no dynamic code execution, external network activity, or untrusted data handling visible.\n   - The original code snippet matches the described import statements, confirming that the reports are accurate in their observation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent. This is consistent with the code provided.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - Since the code is purely import statements with no suspicious patterns, these scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is justified because there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - Malware scores are also 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The high confidence score (1) is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that there is no malware activity. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they only analyze the visible code.\n   - Their conclusion that the code is benign is justified.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the analysis.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n- Since the code is only import statements, the risk is minimal.\n- If there were future concerns about hidden malicious code in imported modules, that would require further analysis of those modules, but based solely on this snippet, the assessment stands.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  (No malicious activity detected or implied.)\n  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  (Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.)\n  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n  (No security risks identified based on the provided code.)\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign. No changes are necessary. The code is a standard, safe set of import statements with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
