  "purpose": "Import statements for modules likely used in a larger Python package, facilitating functionalities such as data generation, knee point detection, shape finding, and version management.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; only internal module imports.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code solely imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. Import statements are standard and do not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code contains straightforward import statements importing specific modules and functions from relative paths within the package. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. These imports serve to organize code functionality within a package, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears to be standard import statements typical of a Python package setup.",
