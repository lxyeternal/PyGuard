{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing modules and functions related to data generation, shape detection, and version information, likely for use in a larger data processing or analysis project.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and functions from local package files: data_generator, knee_locator, shape_detector, and _version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow is explicitly visible; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports classes and functions from local modules within the package. There are no indications of data leakage, malicious code, or obfuscated behavior. It does not involve dynamic code execution, external network communication, or handling of untrusted input. The presence of version information suggests maintenance awareness but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard import statements for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical for a package setup.",
