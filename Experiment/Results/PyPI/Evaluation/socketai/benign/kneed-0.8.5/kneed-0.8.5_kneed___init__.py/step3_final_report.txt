{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules within a Python package, likely for use in further processing or analysis within the package.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules: .data_generator, .knee_locator, .shape_detector, ._version",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted input, external data, or perform any data output or network communication",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules/classes/functions into the namespace; no data flow from external sources or untrusted inputs occurs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for package setup or module initialization",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from local modules, with no dynamic execution, external network activity, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of these imports. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all 0, which is consistent with the code's content. Confidence scores are high (1), reflecting certainty in the benign assessment. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify the low risk and malware scores. No further analysis or mitigation is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of import statements within a Python package, posing no security risks or malicious intent. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No modifications or further scrutiny are required.",
