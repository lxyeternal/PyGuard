{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific modules and functions related to data generation, shape detection, and versioning, likely for a larger data analysis or processing package.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and functions from local package files: data_generator, knee_locator, shape_detector, and version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling, network activity, or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed; this is purely import statements setting up dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code simply imports local modules and functions without any suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns are present. It appears to be a typical setup for a Python package, importing core components for further processing. Since no external inputs or untrusted data handling is involved, and no malicious constructs are present, the code seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import block for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It merely sets up dependencies for a larger application or library.",
