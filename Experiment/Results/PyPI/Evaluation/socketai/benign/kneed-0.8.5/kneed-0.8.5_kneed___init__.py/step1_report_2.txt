  "purpose": "This code imports various modules and functions, likely for a larger data processing or analysis project.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the same package: data_generator, knee_locator, shape_detector, and version information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only imports modules and functions.",
  "flows": "Data flow is not explicitly visible here; only module imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious constructs are observed in the import statements; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports from internal modules, including a version string. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data leakage, or malicious activity. It appears to be part of a larger, standard package setup. The structure and content are typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple set of import statements with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any obfuscation, malware, or suspicious activities.",
