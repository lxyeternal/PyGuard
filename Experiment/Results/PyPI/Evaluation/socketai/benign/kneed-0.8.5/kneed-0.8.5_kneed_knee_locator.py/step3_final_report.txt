{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a class to detect the knee or elbow point in a curve, primarily for data analysis and visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays (x, y), optional matplotlib for plotting, and internal computations involving numpy and scipy functions.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sinks; visualization functions only generate plots locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input through normalization, spline fitting, extrema detection, thresholding, and knee detection logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a transparent, standard implementation of a curve inflection point detection algorithm using common scientific libraries. It performs normalization, spline fitting, extrema detection, and threshold-based knee identification. The optional plotting functions are safe and well-structured. No network access, file operations, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation for curve analysis with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
