{
  "purpose": "The code implements a class for identifying the knee or elbow point in a curve, typically for data analysis or feature detection in graphical data.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'x' and 'y' parameters provided during instantiation; it also reads the data for normalization, differentiation, and plotting.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or code injection. Plotting functions use matplotlib if available, but do not execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into normalization and difference calculations, then into local maxima/minima detection, threshold evaluation, and finally into knee point determination. No external or untrusted data flows into sensitive sink functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a knee/elbow detection algorithm. It performs normalization, differentiation, and detection steps without unusual or misleading constructs. The conditional normalization logic and property definitions are straightforward. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of a curve analysis tool, with input validation, flexible normalization, and plotting capabilities. It imports standard scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib) with appropriate checks. No code injection, malicious data handling, or sabotage elements are detected. The code does not perform network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The logic is clear, with no obfuscated or misleading code features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of a curve analysis class for knee/elbow detection, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It solely performs data analysis and visualization functions as intended without harmful side effects.",
