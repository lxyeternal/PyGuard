{
  "purpose": "This code implements a class for detecting the knee or elbow point in a curve, useful for inflection point analysis in data series, particularly in identifying optimal cut-off points or thresholds.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays x and y; reads parameters for curve detection, normalization, and polynomial fitting; accesses imported modules such as numpy, scipy, and optionally matplotlib.",
  "sinks": "Uses data from input arrays and internal variables for calculations; does not perform untrusted data output or file operations; no apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through normalization, difference calculation, local extrema detection, and threshold comparison to identify the knee/elbow point; no external untrusted sources or commands are invoked dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of standard scientific libraries without signs of malicious obfuscation. No dynamic code execution, network access, or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a curve inflection point detection algorithm using common scientific computing libraries. It performs data normalization, polynomial or interpolated smoothing, extrema detection, and threshold-based knee/elbow detection. It handles plotting via matplotlib if available, with appropriate error handling. No code indicates malicious intent or malicious behavior. The logic appears transparent and consistent with its stated purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a benign implementation of a curve inflection point detection algorithm, intended for data analysis and visualization. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors. The overall security risk is minimal.",
