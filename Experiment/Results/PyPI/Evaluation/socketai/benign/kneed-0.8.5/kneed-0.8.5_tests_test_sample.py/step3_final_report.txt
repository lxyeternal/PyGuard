{
  "purpose": "A comprehensive test suite for the 'kneed' library, validating its functionality with synthetic data and visualization functions.",
  "sources": "Synthetic data generators from 'kneed.data_generator' and standard libraries; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Internal data flows; plotting functions generate figures but do not communicate externally or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from synthetic generators to 'KneeLocator' instances and plotting functions within the test environment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, controlled testing suite for the 'kneed' package, utilizing synthetic data and assertions. No external network, file, or system operations are present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified. The code's purpose is validation, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the code's content and purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
