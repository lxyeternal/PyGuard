  "purpose": "Unit tests for the KneeLocator class, verifying error handling when matplotlib is missing.",
  "sources": "import statements, particularly the imported functions and modules; use of pytest.raises to detect ModuleNotFoundError.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output generation present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; test functions invoke methods that raise exceptions if dependencies are missing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward test code with dependency checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two test functions using pytest to verify that a ModuleNotFoundError is raised if matplotlib is not installed. It imports data_generator and knee_locator modules, and calls their methods, expecting failure if dependencies are absent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is simple, standard testing code for dependency validation, with no suspicious constructs or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard dependency error testing for the knee_locator functionality without any malicious intent or security risks. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
