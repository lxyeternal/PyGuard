{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the KneeLocator class, verifying plot functions raise errors when matplotlib is not installed.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources; it imports modules and calls functions within those modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or harmful effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, executing functions, and handling exceptions, without external data flow or malicious injection.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward test suite using pytest to verify error handling for missing dependencies. It imports specific functions and classes, then attempts to call plotting methods that should raise ModuleNotFoundError if matplotlib is not installed. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data theft, or system harm. The code appears standard for testing library behavior when dependencies are absent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test script with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely tests error handling in case of missing dependencies and does not perform any harmful operations.",
