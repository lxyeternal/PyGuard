  "purpose": "Test functions verifying that plotting methods in the KneeLocator class raise ModuleNotFoundError when matplotlib is not installed.",
  "sources": "dg.figure2() generating data, import statements, function calls to kl.plot_knee_normalized() and kl.plot_knee()",
  "sinks": "The test functions themselves, primarily raising exceptions; no data leaks or external data handling",
  "flows": "dg.figure2() -> KneeLocator instance -> plot_knee_normalized()/plot_knee() -> exception if matplotlib missing",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors; straightforward dependency error handling",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest test suite that checks for ModuleNotFoundError when matplotlib is missing. It imports modules, generates data, and calls plotting functions, expecting errors if dependencies are absent. No malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the benign, dependency validation purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward test suite for dependency error handling with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores and analysis are accurate and appropriate.",
