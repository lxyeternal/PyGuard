{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the kneed library, specifically testing plotting functions with missing matplotlib dependency.",
  "sources": "Import statements and function calls to dg.figure2(), KneeLocator, and pytest.raises.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the code mainly raises exceptions for missing modules.",
  "flows": "Imports -> function calls -> exception handling (raises ModuleNotFoundError).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from a third-party library, then defines two test functions that intentionally trigger errors if matplotlib is not installed. Both tests invoke dg.figure2() and create instances of KneeLocator, then call plotting methods within pytest.raises blocks to verify correct error handling. No untrusted inputs, external data flows, or malicious code execution are present. The code solely performs error handling tests related to missing dependencies, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward test code with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs dependency error handling for plotting functions, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
