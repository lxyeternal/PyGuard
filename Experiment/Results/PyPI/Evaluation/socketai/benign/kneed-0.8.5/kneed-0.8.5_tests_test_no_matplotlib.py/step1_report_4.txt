{
  "purpose": "The code contains test functions that verify the behavior of the KneeLocator class and data generator, specifically testing error handling when matplotlib is not installed.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pytest, DataGenerator from kneed.data_generator, and KneeLocator from kneed.knee_locator. Data generation via dg.figure2() within test functions.",
  "sinks": "None. The code does not send untrusted data to external systems, write to files, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Imports and data generation flow into test functions, which invoke methods that raise exceptions if dependencies are missing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors observed. The tests are straightforward, checking for ModuleNotFoundError exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary testing and functionality modules, defines two test functions that invoke methods expected to raise errors if matplotlib is absent. It calls dg.figure2() to generate data and creates a KneeLocator object, then calls plotting methods that depend on matplotlib. The tests specifically check for ModuleNotFoundError, which suggests intended error handling rather than malicious behavior. No suspicious data handling, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite verifying error handling for missing dependencies. It does not contain malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It performs straightforward testing related to plotting functionalities.",
