{
  "purpose": "The code provides static methods to generate various types of synthetic data, including Gaussian noise, specific mathematical functions, and a bumpy pattern, for use with the kneedle algorithm.",
  "sources": "Data is generated internally through numpy functions and predefined arrays; no external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No external data is written or transmitted; outputs are returned as tuples of iterables.",
  "flows": "The functions produce data and return it; there are no flows involving untrusted input or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The data arrays are hardcoded but benign. No external network calls or file operations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with static methods to generate various datasets, primarily for testing or visualization of the kneedle algorithm. Usage of numpy for data creation is standard. There are no input/output operations involving external sources or sinks. The code appears straightforward and well-structured without any hidden or malicious behaviors. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious functions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for synthetic data generation with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply creates datasets for testing purposes. No signs of malware or security threats are detected.",
