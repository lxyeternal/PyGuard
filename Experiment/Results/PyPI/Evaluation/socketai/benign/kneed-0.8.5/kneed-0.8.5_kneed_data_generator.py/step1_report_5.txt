{
  "purpose": "Generate various types of synthetic data for use with the kneedle algorithm or similar analysis tools.",
  "sources": "User input parameters (e.g., seed, mu, sigma, N), internal function calls to numpy for data generation and mathematical computations.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not write to external systems, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence data generation; data is created via numpy functions and returned as tuples.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. All functions produce synthetic data without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with static methods to generate various synthetic datasets using numpy, such as Gaussian noise, mathematical functions, and arbitrary data patterns. The methods do not include network operations, file I/O, or any form of data exfiltration. There are no obfuscated parts, no dynamic code execution, and no apparent malicious intent. The data generated appears solely for testing or plotting purposes within a data analysis context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for synthetic data generation related to the kneedle algorithm. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks present.",
