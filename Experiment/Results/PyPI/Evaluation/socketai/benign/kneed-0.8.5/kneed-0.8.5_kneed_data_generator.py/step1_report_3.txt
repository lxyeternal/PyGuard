{
  "purpose": "The code provides static methods to generate various synthetic datasets, including Gaussian noise, mathematical functions, and a bumpy dataset, for use in data analysis or visualization.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters from function arguments (mu, sigma, seed, etc.) and generates data using numpy functions such as np.random.normal, np.linspace, np.arange, and np.array.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted external data; data generation is deterministic based on inputs or internal constants.",
  "flows": "The data flows are internal calculations based on function parameters or fixed arrays; no external data or untrusted input flows into the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward data generation with no unusual code patterns. The 'bumpy' dataset contains large numeric arrays but no sign of obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with static methods for creating various synthetic datasets, primarily for testing or visualization purposes. Uses numpy for numerical operations, with no external input other than parameters with default values. All functions perform predictable mathematical operations or return fixed arrays, with no evidence of malicious behavior or hidden intent. No code injection, data leakage, or unsafe operations detected. The use of numpy's random seed setting is standard, and the datasets are statically defined or computed in a straightforward manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data generator module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely creates datasets for visualization or analysis without external data dependencies or harmful operations.",
