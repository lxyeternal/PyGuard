{
  "purpose": "Generate synthetic data for testing and visualization related to the kneedle algorithm, including noisy Gaussian data, deterministic functions, and static datasets.",
  "sources": "Internal numpy functions, hardcoded arrays, and parameters; no external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "Returns data as tuples; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data generated internally and returned; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Large static array in 'bumpy()' is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static methods generating synthetic datasets using numpy, with deterministic or static data. No external dependencies, network activity, or obfuscation. The static array in 'bumpy()' is large but hardcoded and not malicious. Use of numpy's seed and functions is standard. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for synthetic data generation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is unjustified; it should be 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and benign nature.",
