{
  "purpose": "The code generates various types of synthetic data for testing or visualization, particularly related to the 'kneedle' algorithm.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as seed for random number generation, and range values for data points.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs returned as tuples; no external or untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence data generation; data is generated internally and returned; no external data flows or external commands are invoked.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. All methods generate predefined or parameterized data; no hardcoded credentials, network connections, or file operations.",
  "analysis": "The script consists of static methods generating different types of synthetic data, including noisy Gaussian, specific mathematical functions, and a bumpy pattern. The use of np.random.seed ensures reproducibility, and no external data sources, network calls, or system modifications are present. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns identified. The code appears purely for data simulation purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for generating synthetic datasets for testing or visualization. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
