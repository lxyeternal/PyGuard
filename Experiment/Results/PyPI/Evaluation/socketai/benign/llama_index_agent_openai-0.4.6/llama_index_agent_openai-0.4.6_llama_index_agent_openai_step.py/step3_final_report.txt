  "confidence": 0.9,
  "purpose": "The code implements a robust OpenAI agent worker handling message flow, tool invocation, and task step management with comprehensive error handling and parsing. It performs no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious modifications.",
  "sources": "Input data from task memory, user input, and tool call arguments.",
  "sinks": "Tool invocation functions, message creation, and event dispatching.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from task memory and user input to tool calls and message responses; tool call arguments parsed and passed to tools; tool outputs appended to memory and used for responses.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Parsing functions handle JSON and regex-based argument extraction safely.",
  "analysis": "The code manages message flow, tool invocation, and error handling in a standard, transparent manner. No network calls, data leaks, or backdoors are present. Parsing functions are robust, and the code structure is clear. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The security risk score is low, reflecting standard operational complexity without vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured OpenAI agent worker with no malicious or suspicious components. The security risk is minimal, and the supply chain security posture is strong.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
