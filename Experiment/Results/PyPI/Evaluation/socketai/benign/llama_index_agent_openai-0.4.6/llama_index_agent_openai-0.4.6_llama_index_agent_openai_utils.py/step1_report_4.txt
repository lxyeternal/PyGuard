  "purpose": "Utility module for OpenAI agent functions, specifically exposing the 'resolve_tool_choice' function.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'llama_index.llms.openai.utils' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data; no network or file system operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as the code only imports and exports a function.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code, no anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function from a third-party library and re-exports it in the '__all__' list. There are no data inputs, outputs, or logic that could be malicious. The module acts as a straightforward pass-through or a re-export, which is common in Python package organization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a utility export with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
