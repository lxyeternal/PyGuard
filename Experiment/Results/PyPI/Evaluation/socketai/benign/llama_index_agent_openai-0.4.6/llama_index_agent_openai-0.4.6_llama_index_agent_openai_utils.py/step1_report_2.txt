  "purpose": "Utility module for OpenAI agent, specifically re-exporting the resolve_tool_choice function.",
  "sources": "Import statement from an external library 'llama_index.llms.openai.utils'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flows involving untrusted input or malicious intent are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, only re-exporting a function. No suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility function from a third-party library and re-exports it. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data handling is involved. The import statement could potentially load external code, but that is standard in Python modules and does not necessarily imply malicious intent. The code is very simple and adheres to common patterns without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a re-export module for a utility function. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
