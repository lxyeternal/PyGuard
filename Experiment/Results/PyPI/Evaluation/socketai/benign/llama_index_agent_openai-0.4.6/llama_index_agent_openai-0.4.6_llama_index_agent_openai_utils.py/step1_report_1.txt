{
  "purpose": "Utility module for OpenAI agent functionalities, specifically exporting 'resolve_tool_choice'.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'resolve_tool_choice' from an external library 'llama_index.llms.openai.utils'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; only an import and export statement.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns observed. The import suggests reliance on external library, but nothing suspicious is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module that imports a function and exposes it via __all__. There are no embedded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns. The import path indicates dependence on a third-party library, but this alone does not imply malicious intent. The code's simplicity minimizes the likelihood of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple export module for a utility function. There are no signs of malware, suspicious data flows, or security issues.",
