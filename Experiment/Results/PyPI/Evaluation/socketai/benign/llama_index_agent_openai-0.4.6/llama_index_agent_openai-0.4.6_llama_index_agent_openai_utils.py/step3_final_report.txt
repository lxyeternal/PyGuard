  "sources": "Import statement from 'llama_index.llms.openai.utils'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows.",
  "flows": "Import source to module namespace; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export, no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports a function from an external library and exposes it via __all__. No data handling, user input, network activity, or embedded secrets are present. The reliance on an external library is standard and does not imply malicious intent. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The high confidence levels reflect the straightforward and safe nature of this module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
