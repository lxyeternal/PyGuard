  "purpose": "Utility module providing a function for resolving tool choices in an OpenAI agent setup.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'resolve_tool_choice' from 'llama_index.llms.openai.utils'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leakage or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways within this code snippet; it only imports and exposes a function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement and an __all__ declaration to expose the imported function. No input handling, data processing, or output occurs here. The imported module's security posture cannot be assessed from this snippet, but the code itself shows no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It appears to be a standard utility module intended to re-export a function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility wrapper with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply exposes an imported function. There is no malware, suspicious data handling, or obfuscation detected.",
