  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured OpenAI assistant wrapper with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary concern is the lack of input validation, which could be exploited but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2–0.3 due to validation gaps."
