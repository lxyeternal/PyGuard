{
  "purpose": "Defines an OpenAI agent class that wraps around AgentRunner and OpenAIAgentWorker for executing AI tasks with tools, memory, and callbacks.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes, parameters in __init__ and from_tools methods, user-provided tool lists, optional callback managers, system prompts, and configurations.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data input in tools, callback_manager, system_prompt, prefix_messages, and user parameters. No evident untrusted data sinks leading to security issues in the code itself.",
  "flows": "Initialization of the agent with user-provided or default tools, memory, and prompts; creation of step_engine with tools and callbacks; setup of the superclass with configured components; method to instantiate from tool list and parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs an agent object with configurable components such as tools, memory, and prompts. It enforces that the LLM supports function calling, which is standard for OpenAI models supporting function calls. The import statements are standard, and no external or untrusted data is processed in a way that could lead to code injection or data exfiltration. Callback management and optional parameters are handled safely. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a structured setup for an OpenAI agent, with no signs of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be a legitimate component for orchestrating AI interactions with tools and memory, adhering to expected patterns.",
