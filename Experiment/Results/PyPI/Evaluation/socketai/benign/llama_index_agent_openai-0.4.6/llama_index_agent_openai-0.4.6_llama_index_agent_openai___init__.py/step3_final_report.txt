  "purpose": "Module setup for exporting specific classes and functions from the llama_index.agent.openai package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'llama_index.agent.openai' submodules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ declaration; no runtime data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes/functions and declares an __all__ list for exports. It contains no dynamic execution, data processing, or network activity. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No issues or vulnerabilities are present or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module interface with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
