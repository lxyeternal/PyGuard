  "purpose": "This code defines and exports specific classes and functions related to OpenAI agents within the llama_index package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'llama_index.agent.openai' module, importing classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input, output, or execute dynamically based on external data.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports modules and defines __all__; there are no data flows involving untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and primarily involves imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from a package, then defines an __all__ list to specify what is exported. There are no dynamic executions, obfuscated code, or data handling beyond standard import statements. The code appears to serve as a module interface for other components.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code snippet. It functions as a simple module import and export declaration, with no signs of malware or suspicious activity.",
