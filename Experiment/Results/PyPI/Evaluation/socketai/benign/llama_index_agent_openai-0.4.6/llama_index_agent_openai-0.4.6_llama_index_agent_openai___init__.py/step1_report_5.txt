{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes and functions from the 'llama_index' package modules related to OpenAI agents and tools, and defines an export list.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'llama_index.agent.openai' submodules.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data processing, network communication, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow detected; code solely performs imports and an export list definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from a third-party package 'llama_index'. It then defines '__all__' to specify exported symbols. There are no indications of data input, output, network activity, or any malicious constructs. The code is standard for module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module that re-exports certain classes and functions from a package without any suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no signs of malware, malicious data handling, or security risks.",
