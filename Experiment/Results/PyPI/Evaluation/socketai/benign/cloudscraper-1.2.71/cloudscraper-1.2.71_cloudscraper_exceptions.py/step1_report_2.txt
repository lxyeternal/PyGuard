  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for cloudscraper and captcha handling to manage specific error scenarios in the library.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading sources; all classes are definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions; solely exception class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no execution flow involving external data.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; the code consists purely of class definitions with docstrings and no dynamic or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception classes for handling Cloudflare-related errors and captcha provider errors within the cloudscraper library. All classes are simple custom exceptions with descriptive docstrings. There are no indications of data manipulation, network operations, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present. The code is clean, straightforward, and serves as a framework for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard exception class definitions module with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and conventional for use in a Python library managing cloud security challenges.",
