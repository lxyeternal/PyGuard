  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for cloudscraper and captcha handling in Python.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading occurs in this code).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output, network communication, or untrusted data handling occurs).",
  "flows": "None (no data flows from source to sink as there are no data processing or input/output operations).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code consists solely of exception class definitions with standard inheritance and docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a set of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Cloudflare and captcha handling. It includes base exception classes and specialized subclasses with descriptive docstrings. No input/output, data manipulation, or external interactions are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are detectable. No obfuscation or malware-like behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in a cloudscraper context. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks. It appears to be standard and benign.",
