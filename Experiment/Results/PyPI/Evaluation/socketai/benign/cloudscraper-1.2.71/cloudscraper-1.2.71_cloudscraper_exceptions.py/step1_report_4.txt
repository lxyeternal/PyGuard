  "purpose": "Define exception classes for cloudscraper and captcha providers to handle various error scenarios.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; exception classes are defined statically.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or output actions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink in exception class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic. The code strictly defines exception classes with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling Cloudflare and captcha-related errors. It contains only class definitions with no executable or data-processing logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The code appears to serve as a structured error handling module. No external data sources or sinks are involved, and no obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard set of exception class definitions for error handling in a Python library related to cloud security and captcha management. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
