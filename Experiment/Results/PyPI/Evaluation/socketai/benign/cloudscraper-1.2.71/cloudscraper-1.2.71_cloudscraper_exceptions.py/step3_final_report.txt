  "purpose": "This code defines a set of custom exception classes for handling Cloudflare challenges and captcha provider errors within the cloudscraper library.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions and docstrings; no external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows involving untrusted data; the code does not process external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code solely declares exception classes without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of class definitions inheriting from Exception, with descriptive docstrings. It serves as a structured error handling framework for cloudscraper's Cloudflare and captcha error scenarios. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is static, straightforward, and standard, with no external interactions or dynamic code execution. The absence of any suspicious or malicious patterns indicates a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard exception class module with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and justified based on the code's content.",
