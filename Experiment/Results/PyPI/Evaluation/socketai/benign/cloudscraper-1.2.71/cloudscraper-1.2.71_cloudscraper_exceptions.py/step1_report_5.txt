{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for cloudscraper and captcha handling, mainly for error reporting and control flow.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reads are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs or data handling mechanisms that could lead to leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of custom exception classes for cloudscraper and captcha error handling. It includes base classes and specialized subclasses for specific error conditions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious logic. The code does not interact with external inputs, databases, or network resources. It serves purely as a structured exception hierarchy, with no indication of obfuscated code or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely intended to organize error handling through custom exceptions for cloudscraper and captcha providers. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
