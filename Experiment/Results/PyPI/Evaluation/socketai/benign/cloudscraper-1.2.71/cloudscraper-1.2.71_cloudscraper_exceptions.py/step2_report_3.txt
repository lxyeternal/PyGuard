  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the validity of their conclusions, the consistency of their scores, and whether any adjustments are warranted.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Cloudflare challenges and captcha handling.\n- The code is static, with no data input/output, network calls, or malicious constructs.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious logic are present.\n- The purpose is purely to provide structured error handling within the cloudscraper library.\n\n**Specific Analysis per Report:**\n\n### Reports 1-5 Summary:\n- **Purpose:** Define custom exception classes for error handling.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No data flow or external data involved.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All agree the code is standard, benign, and free of malicious intent.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Confidence:** All at 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, correct.\n- **Malware:** 0, correct.\n- **Security Risk:** 0, correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently at 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not contain any malicious payloads or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as expected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, since the code does not introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Are any adjustments needed?**  \nNo. The reports are accurate, consistent, and justified in their scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware:** Given the code is purely class definitions for exceptions, there's no evidence of malware. The malware score should remain **0**.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation present; score remains **0**.\n- **Risk:** No security risk or vulnerabilities are introduced; score remains **0**.\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and thorough. They correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain unchanged.\n\n**Final Note:**  \nThis code snippet is a straightforward set of exception class definitions, serving as part of a larger error handling framework. No further action or concern is necessary from a security perspective.",
