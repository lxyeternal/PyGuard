  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious elements, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Cloudflare challenges and captcha handling.\n- There are no data inputs, external calls, or data manipulation.\n- The code is straightforward, well-structured, and contains no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not include any suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or network interactions.\n- The exception classes are standard and serve as part of a larger error handling framework.\n- No anomalies or deviations from typical exception class definitions are observed.\n\n**Risk and Malware Scores:**\n- Given the absence of malicious behavior, the malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- Obfuscation is not present; the code is clear and readable, so 0 is justified.\n- The overall security risk is low, consistent with the assigned score of 0.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- No concerns or discrepancies are evident in the reports.\n- The reasoning is sound, and the scores align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- I concur with the provided scores.\n- The code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Risk score: **0**\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's simplicity.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, non-malicious exception module with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
