  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Cloudflare challenges and captcha providers.\n- There are no data inputs, external calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code serves as a structured error handling framework within the larger cloudscraper library.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### 1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues**\n\n- **Are the issues reported present?**  \n  **Yes.** The reports correctly identify that the code is just class definitions with docstrings, and no malicious or obfuscated code exists.\n\n- **Any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The code appears syntactically correct and logically straightforward.\n\n#### 2. **Scores and Justifications**\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  **0** — No malicious behavior or payloads. The code is purely exception class definitions.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  **0** — No obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  **0** — No vulnerabilities or security risks are evident from the class definitions alone.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  **0** — Given the absence of any suspicious or malicious elements, a zero score is appropriate.\n\n#### 3. **Analysis of Each Report**\n\nAll reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, benign, and serves as exception hierarchy definitions. They assign high confidence (1) and zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the actual code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are reasonable and justified.\n\n- **Potential concerns:**  \n  No concerns are identified; the code is straightforward and safe.\n\n- **Additional notes:**  \n  Since the code is purely class definitions, there’s no reason to adjust the scores. If any future code includes dynamic behavior, external calls, or data handling, re-evaluation would be necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **The code is a standard, benign exception class module.**  \n- **No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.**  \n- **Scores are appropriate and should remain as is.**\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the actual code content.",
