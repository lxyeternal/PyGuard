  "conclusion": "This code functions as a legitimate Cloudflare challenge solver, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The primary concern is the reliance on dynamic imports, which could be exploited if dependencies are malicious, but this does not constitute malicious code by itself. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscation is absent, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to dependency trust assumptions."
