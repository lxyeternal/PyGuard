  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious and contains no obfuscation. Its main risk stems from executing untrusted, dynamically generated code. The current scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.6 if inputs are untrusted. Proper input validation and sanitization are recommended to mitigate potential exploitation."
