  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python module named 'cloudscraper'. It reads version info from `__init__.py`, reads the README for long description, and specifies dependencies. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling untrusted input during runtime.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies**  \nAll reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious intent. The regex used for version extraction is typical and safe. No suspicious code patterns or behaviors are present.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, standard code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1. Given the code's nature, this minor score could be due to the inherent risk in package setup scripts (e.g., if malicious code were embedded), but none is present here.\n\n4. **Assessment of Potential Risks**  \nSince the code is purely a setup script with no malicious or suspicious behaviors, the risk scores should remain very low, ideally 0. The minor 0.1 assigned in one report could be considered an overestimation, as there's no evidence of security issues.\n\n5. **Conclusion & Recommendations**  \n- The code is a standard, benign package setup script.\n- No evidence supports any malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, with the exception of the minor security risk score of 0.1, which should be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n**Final personal estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The reported scores are consistent with this assessment, except for the minor security risk score which should be adjusted downward.",
