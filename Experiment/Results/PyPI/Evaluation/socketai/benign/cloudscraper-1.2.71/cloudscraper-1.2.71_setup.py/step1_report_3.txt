{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'cloudscraper', intended to package and distribute the module via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads the package version from 'cloudscraper/__init__.py', reads the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data influences system behavior or external systems; primarily reads files and sets up package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> assigns to VERSION; Reads README -> assigns to readme; Calls setup() with package info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets (beyond author info), or obfuscation detected. No malicious or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads version information from a source file and README content, then invokes setuptools.setup() with static package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources. The code structure and content are typical for a Python package setup script and do not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities present in this code. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
