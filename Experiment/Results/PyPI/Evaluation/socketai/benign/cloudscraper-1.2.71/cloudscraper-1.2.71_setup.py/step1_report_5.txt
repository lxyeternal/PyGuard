{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'cloudscraper' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the '__init__.py' file to extract version information, reading the 'README.md' for long description, and package dependency specifications.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function processes the package information but does not execute untrusted code or handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "File reading operations lead into the setup configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors observed. The code follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations: reading version info from a package file, reading a readme for documentation, and configuring package dependencies and metadata. No code execution based on external or untrusted input, no dynamic code evaluation, no network operations or suspicious behaviors. All operations are typical for a Python package setup script, with no indicators of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious behavior or security risks. It reads version info and package metadata securely and follows standard practices.",
