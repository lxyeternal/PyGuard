{
  "purpose": "The script defines setup configuration for the 'cloudscraper' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading '__init__.py' to extract version; reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; setup process uses data for packaging purposes only.",
  "flows": "Reading files to obtain version and description, then passing data to 'setup()' function for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures: it reads the package's version from '__init__.py', reads the README for description, and invokes 'setup()' with metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. All operations are related to package configuration. The version extraction uses regex on a local file, which is common and safe. Dependencies are declared normally. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It strictly handles package configuration data without any malicious operations.",
