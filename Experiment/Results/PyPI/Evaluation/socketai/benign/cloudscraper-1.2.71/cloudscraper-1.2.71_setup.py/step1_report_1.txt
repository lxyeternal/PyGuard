{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'cloudscraper', including reading version info, package data, and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__init__.py', reads 'README.md' for long description, and specifies dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure actions are present.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and description data during setup; no untrusted data flow or external command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated segments, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code strictly follows standard setup.py procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations: reading version info from a source file, reading a markdown readme, and calling setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious network calls, and no handling of untrusted input are observed. The version extraction uses regex, which is typical for this purpose. All dependencies are explicitly listed, and the package metadata appears legitimate. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It strictly performs package configuration tasks with no suspicious or malicious code components.",
