{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup.py script for packaging the 'cloudscraper' Python module, performing typical package metadata and dependency setup without dynamic or untrusted code execution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'cloudscraper/__init__.py' via regex, reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or used in a way that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local file, then proceeds with package setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to extract version, which could fail if pattern doesn't match, but this is a common pattern and not security-related; no obfuscation or secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script that reads local files for version and description, then calls setup() with package info. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input occurs. The regex for version extraction is standard, and no suspicious patterns or malicious code are present. The dependency list is explicit and appropriate. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious intent are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores should be 0, and security risk is effectively zero.",
