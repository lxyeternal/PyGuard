{
  "purpose": "The code collects system and environment information, including platform details, Python interpreter info, library versions, and SSL cipher support.",
  "sources": "Reads data from system modules (platform, sys), ssl context creation, and requests/urllib3 libraries for version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted external input or data; primarily gathers static system information.",
  "flows": "Reads system and environment data (sources) to produce a structured report without external or untrusted data input; no flow to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system info and library versions, and attempts to retrieve SSL cipher info. It handles exceptions gracefully. No dynamic code execution, no network activity beyond version info, and no data leaks or malicious behaviors are present. The only potentially notable aspect is the SSL cipher list retrieval, which is a benign function aimed at compatibility or security checks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign system information utility with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It solely collects and displays environment details.",
