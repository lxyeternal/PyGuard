{
  "purpose": "The code gathers system and environment information, including platform details, Python interpreter info, cryptographic ciphers, and library versions.",
  "sources": "Reads data from system platform modules, ssl context, and library version attributes.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via print (if run as main), but no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "System info is collected and printed; no data flows to external systems or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation present. Uses standard library functions and publicly known modules.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and third-party libraries, retrieves system and cryptography info, and outputs it. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. No unsafe code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity or hidden behaviors are evident. It simply reports environment info, which is typical for diagnostic or informational scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and intended for system information gathering without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious anomalies. The overall security risk is minimal.",
