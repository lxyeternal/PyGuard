{
  "purpose": "Collects system environment information including platform details, Python interpreter info, SSL cipher support, and dependency versions for diagnostic or informational purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system platform info, Python version, SSL cipher list, and version info of requests, urllib3, and a local __version__ module.",
  "sinks": "Outputs structured environment info via print; no external data sinks or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Gathers data from system modules and library version attributes, then structures and prints the info; no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard libraries, handles exceptions gracefully, and performs straightforward info gathering without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and third-party libraries, retrieves system and environment info, handles exceptions, and outputs data. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations beyond version retrieval, or contain suspicious code. SSL cipher listing is a benign security check. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The purpose is diagnostic, with minimal security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign system information utility with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
