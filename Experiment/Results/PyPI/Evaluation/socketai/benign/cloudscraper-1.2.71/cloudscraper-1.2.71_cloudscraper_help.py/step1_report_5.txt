  "purpose": "The code gathers system and environment information, including platform details, Python interpreter info, and SSL cipher data.",
  "sources": "Reads system info from platform module, SSL context for ciphers, and package versions from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs other than printing JSON info about the environment.",
  "flows": "Collects system data -> structures data -> outputs as JSON via print.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns detected. Uses standard library functions and public modules.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard modules and functions to retrieve environment details. It attempts to get SSL ciphers and Python version info, with fallback handling. No external data input or sensitive data handling observed. No code execution, network communication, or suspicious behavior is present. The code is straightforward and appears to be for informational purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign system information gathering script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It simply collects and displays environment details.",
