  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate plugin architecture with no embedded malicious behavior. The main security risk lies in dynamic import without validation, which could be exploited if module names are controlled externally. Scores are appropriately low for malware and obfuscation; a moderate risk score (~0.3) reflects potential risks associated with dynamic import practices. Proper validation of module names is recommended to mitigate this risk."
