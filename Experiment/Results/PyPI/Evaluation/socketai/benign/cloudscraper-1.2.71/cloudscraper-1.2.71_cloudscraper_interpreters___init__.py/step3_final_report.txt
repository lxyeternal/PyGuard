  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for JavaScript interpreters with dynamic import capabilities and a method to evaluate JavaScript code, intended for plugin-based challenge solving.",
  "sources": "Dynamic import of modules based on 'name' parameter, invocation of abstract 'eval' method in subclasses, logging errors during import failures.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of 'eval' in subclasses, logging errors, returning formatted float values from 'solveChallenge'.",
  "flows": "dynamicImport method loads modules -> interpreters stored in registry -> 'solveChallenge' calls 'eval' in subclass -> result formatted and returned.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import without validation of module names, potential for loading malicious modules if 'name' is externally controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code is a plugin framework for JavaScript interpreters, with a registry and dynamic module loading. The 'eval' method is abstract, so actual code execution security depends on subclass implementations. The dynamic import mechanism can be exploited if module names are manipulated, but no malicious code is present in this fragment. The use of 'eval' in subclasses could be risky if misused, but this is outside the scope of this code. The overall structure is standard and does not contain obfuscation or embedded malware. The primary security concern is ensuring module name validation during dynamic import to prevent loading malicious modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate plugin architecture with no embedded malicious behavior. The main security risk lies in dynamic import without validation, which could be exploited if module names are controlled externally. Scores are appropriately low for malware and obfuscation; a moderate risk score (~0.3) reflects potential risks associated with dynamic import practices. Proper validation of module names is recommended to mitigate this risk.",
