  "conclusion": "The code functions as a JavaScript interpreter wrapper capable of executing obfuscated scripts, which introduces notable security risks in supply chain contexts. While no malicious code is explicitly detected, the capacity for executing arbitrary, potentially malicious, obfuscated JavaScript justifies elevated security concern. The inherent risk stems from executing untrusted code, and the use of obfuscation handling further amplifies this threat. Therefore, the overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is moderate to high depending on input trustworthiness."
