  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'contextvars' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or user input used in a way that affects execution.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file as 'readme' and then passing it to 'long_description'; no flow of untrusted data or external input beyond file read.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code uses standard setuptools setup process.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a local README file to include in package metadata, then calls setuptools.setup() with static package information and dependencies. No user input, network communication, or malicious code constructs are present. The package metadata appears legitimate, and dependencies are standard. No signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are found.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It safely defines package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious or malicious features.",
