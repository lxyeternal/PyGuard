  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'contextvars', configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local 'README.rst' file for long description; static configuration parameters within 'setuptools.setup()'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, static setup script with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script that reads a local README file and calls 'setuptools.setup()' with static parameters. It contains no untrusted input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated constructs. All dependencies are standard, and the structure follows common packaging practices. No suspicious patterns or security issues are detected. The code's simplicity and static nature support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No further action is necessary.",
