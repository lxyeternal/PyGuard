  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'contextvars' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst file for long description; uses static data for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A; no untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks using setuptools, reading a README file and defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no dynamic code executions, input validations, or external data manipulations that could be malicious. The dependencies are well-known, and no suspicious behaviors such as network access, credential handling, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
