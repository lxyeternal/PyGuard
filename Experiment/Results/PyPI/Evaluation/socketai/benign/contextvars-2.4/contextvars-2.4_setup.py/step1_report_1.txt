  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'contextvars' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; setup parameters are static and predefined.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. It reads a README file for the long description and specifies package info, classifiers, and requirements. No input from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns. All data is statically defined or read from a local file with no user input or environment variables involved. The code follows typical setup conventions and does not contain any malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs package configuration without involving untrusted data or harmful code.",
