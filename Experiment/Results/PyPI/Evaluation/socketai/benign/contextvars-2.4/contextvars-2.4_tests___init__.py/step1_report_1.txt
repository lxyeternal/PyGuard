{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically discovers and runs unit tests in the current directory matching the pattern 'test_*.py' using Python's unittest framework.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__) for directory path, and potentially 'sys' for process control",
  "sinks": "sys.exit() based on test results, which affects process exit status",
  "flows": "Discover test files -> Run tests via unittest.runner -> Exit process based on test success",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard test suite runner with no hidden or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines a test suite discovery function, and executes the test suite with a standard runner. Uses '__file__' to determine current directory and runs all test files matching 'test_*.py'. No hardcoded credentials, no data leaks, no network connections, or obfuscated code. The use of sys.exit() based on test success is standard for CI pipelines. No signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions solely as a test runner for unit tests in the current directory. It performs no malicious actions, does not handle untrusted input, and adheres to typical usage patterns of the unittest framework. No security concerns detected.",
