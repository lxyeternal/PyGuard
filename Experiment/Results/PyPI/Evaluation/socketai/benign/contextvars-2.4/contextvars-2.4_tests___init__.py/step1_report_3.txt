{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to discover and run all unit tests matching 'test_*.py' in the current directory and its subdirectories.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current directory path (__file__), environment variables (via sys.argv), and loads test files matching a pattern.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to the console via unittest's runner and exits with a status code indicating success or failure.",
  "flows": "The script gathers test files from the directory, runs them, and outputs the results; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and uses standard unittest library functions without any unusual or obfuscated constructs. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules (os.path, sys, unittest), discovers test modules matching 'test_*.py' in the script directory, and executes the test suite with a standard test runner. It then exits with an appropriate status code based on test success. All operations are typical for a test runner. No external data, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated logic, and no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test runner script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs file discovery and test execution in a typical manner. No vulnerabilities or malware detected.",
