{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to discover and run unit tests in Python files matching 'test_*.py' within the current directory.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file's directory to discover test files; it also reads the system environment via sys and os modules.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs test results to the console via unittest.runner.TextTestRunner; no untrusted data handling or external network communication occurs.",
  "flows": "The code flows from discovering test files (source: directory path) to executing tests and then exiting based on success/failure (sink: sys.exit).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code solely performs test discovery and execution without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and uses unittest to load and run tests found in the current directory. It employs standard patterns and modules with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or external communication. The code simply executes test suites and exits accordingly, which is typical for test scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard Python unittest runner with no malicious intent or security issues. It functions as intended for testing purposes without any suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
