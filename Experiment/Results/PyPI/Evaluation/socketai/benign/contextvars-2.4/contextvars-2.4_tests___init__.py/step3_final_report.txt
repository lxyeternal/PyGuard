{
  "purpose": "A Python script that discovers and runs unit tests matching 'test_*.py' in the current directory using the unittest framework.",
  "sources": "The directory of the current script (__file__), which provides the path for test discovery.",
  "sinks": "The test runner executes test cases; no untrusted data or external sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "Test discovery from the directory -> loading tests -> executing tests -> exit based on success.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; standard use of unittest modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines a test suite discovery function, and runs tests with a standard test runner. It uses 'os.path.dirname(__file__)' for test discovery, which is safe. The test runner executes discovered tests and exits with an appropriate status. No external network activity, no handling of untrusted input, and no obfuscation are present. The code is a typical, benign test script with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe Python test runner with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's purpose and behavior.",
