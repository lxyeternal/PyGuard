{
  "purpose": "Implementation of context management similar to Python's 'contextvars' module, providing thread-local context storage with strict type and class restrictions.",
  "sources": "getters and setters in ContextVar, Context, and Token classes; thread-local storage (_state); context data (_data) in Context instances.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communication, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "ContextVar.get/set/reset methods access and modify thread-local context data; Context.run sets and restores context; Token manages state for reset operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of strict class/module name checks via metaclasses is unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of context management with thread safety and immutability. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. The strict class restrictions serve as safeguards but do not introduce vulnerabilities. No external data flows or network activity are present. The code operates solely within process memory, managing context data per thread.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation of context management similar to Python's 'contextvars' module. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements are detected. The strict class restrictions are unusual but not malicious. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk.",
