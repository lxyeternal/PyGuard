  "purpose": "Static analysis plugin to enforce import style and ban certain modules/patterns.",
  "sources": "AST nodes, configuration options, static data structures.",
  "sinks": "Error message generation, pattern matching results.",
  "flows": "AST traversal to rule enforcement via pattern matching and configuration parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no external data flow or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis of import statements, compiling regex patterns for unstructured module bans, and matching against static lists. It does not execute code, communicate over networks, or handle untrusted input. The configuration options are static and intended for code quality enforcement. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis plugin designed for import hygiene enforcement. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The static pattern matching and configuration parsing are standard practices, with no malicious intent or external data flow.",
