{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Flake8 plugin to enforce import statement rules, such as banning certain modules and disallowing relative imports, with additional support for legacy Python 2 module replacements.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include: `__future__` import statements, AST nodes during code traversal, configuration options for banned modules and relative import restrictions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are: logging or reporting error messages related to import violations; no execution or data leakage points are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from AST traversal identifying import statements (sources) to rule-checking functions that generate error messages if violations occur (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. The code is well-structured, primarily for static analysis with no dynamic execution or network activities.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static analysis plugin designed to parse and enforce import rules in Python code. It uses the `ast` module to traverse import statements and applies user-defined bans via configurations. It includes functions for compiling glob-like patterns into regex, checking if modules are banned, and generating warning messages. The only external data is configuration options, which are parsed and stored as class variables. No untrusted input handling, network activity, or code execution occurs. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is evident. The code's purpose is purely static code checking, with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static code quality and compliance checker for import statements. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is well-structured for its intended purpose without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
