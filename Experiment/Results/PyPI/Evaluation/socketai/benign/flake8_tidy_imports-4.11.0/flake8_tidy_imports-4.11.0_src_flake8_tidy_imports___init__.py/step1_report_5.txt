{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Flake8 plugin to enforce import statement standards and ban certain modules or patterns, primarily for code linting and modernization purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'tree' (AST of the source code) during traversal, and from configuration options such as '--banned-modules' and '--ban-relative-imports'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs linting messages related to import bans and alias issues; no data leaks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "The source code data flows from the AST nodes during traversal to rule evaluation functions which generate warnings based on module names and import structure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code contains standard import analysis and pattern matching. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static analysis plugin designed for code linting and code style enforcement, not executing external commands, network requests, or handling untrusted input. It uses regex pattern matching and configuration parsing to identify banned modules and import patterns. There is no evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The use of the 'version' function from 'importlib.metadata' is standard for package versioning. No obfuscation, malicious behaviors, or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign static analysis plugin intended for improving code quality and compatibility. No malicious behavior or security risks are present based on the current review.",
