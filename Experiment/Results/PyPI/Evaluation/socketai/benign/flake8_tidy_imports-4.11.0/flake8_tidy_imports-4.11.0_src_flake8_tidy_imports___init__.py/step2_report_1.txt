  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Static analysis plugin for import style enforcement and banning modules.\n- Findings: No suspicious activity, no external data flow, no malicious anomalies.\n- Malware Score: 0.0\n- Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is a static analysis tool with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The plugin only inspects AST nodes and configuration data, with no network or file operations that could be exploited. The static lists and pattern matching are standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Enforces import rules, supports legacy Python 2 module replacements.\n- Findings: No malicious behavior, no untrusted input handling, static pattern matching.\n- Malware Score: 0.0\n- Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is a static linter plugin, with no evidence of malicious activity. The extensive static data for legacy modules is typical for compatibility tools. No dynamic code execution or external communication is involved.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Enforces import standards, bans certain modules, disallows relative imports.\n- Findings: No suspicious or malicious code, static analysis only, no data leakage.\n- Malware Score: 0.0\n- Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis aligns with the code's purpose. The pattern matching and configuration parsing are standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Enforces import rules, supports code modernization.\n- Findings: No malicious behavior, static pattern matching, no data exfiltration.\n- Malware Score: 0.0\n- Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, consistent with the code's static analysis nature. No dynamic or external activities are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Linting and import style enforcement.\n- Findings: No suspicious activity, no malicious behavior, standard static analysis.\n- Malware Score: 0.0\n- Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nMatches the code's functionality. No malicious indicators are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that this is a static analysis plugin for import enforcement. It performs pattern matching, AST traversal, and configuration parsing—nothing more.\n- **Malware Indicators:** None of the reports or the code itself suggest any malicious activity, such as network communication, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques.\n- **Security Risks:** The only potential concern could be misconfiguration leading to unintended banning of modules, but this is a configuration issue, not malicious code.\n\n### **Final Scores & Justification:**\n\n| Aspect                | Score | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**          | 0.0     | No malicious activity, network, or code injection present. |\n| **Obfuscated**       | 0.0     | Code is clear, straightforward, no obfuscation techniques. |\n| **Risk**             | 0.1     | Minimal, related to misconfiguration, but no security threat. |\n\n**Note:** The risk score is kept very low because misconfiguration could cause false positives or affect code quality, but not security.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**The overall malware score is 0.0, obfuscated is 0.0, and risk is approximately 0.1.**  \nThere is no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code, and the code's purpose is static analysis for code quality enforcement.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nThe report's scores are reasonable and align with the code's behavior.
