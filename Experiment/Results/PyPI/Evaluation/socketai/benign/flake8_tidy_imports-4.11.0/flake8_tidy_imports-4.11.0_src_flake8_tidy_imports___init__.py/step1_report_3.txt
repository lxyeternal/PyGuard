{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Flake8 plugin to enforce import statement rules, such as banning certain modules and disallowing relative imports, to promote code quality and consistency.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the AST nodes during the traversal of Python code (ast.AST nodes). Also reads configuration options for banned modules and patterns from the provided options object.",
  "sinks": "Generates warning or error messages based on the analysis of import statements; does not perform data leakage or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Analyzes import AST nodes to identify banned modules or patterns; warns about import aliases and relative imports based on configured rules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns observed. The code primarily consists of pattern matching, configuration parsing, and AST analysis. No obfuscated code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an AST-based Flake8 plugin class with methods to parse options, analyze import nodes, and identify banned modules or patterns. It includes pattern compilation for wildcards and glob-like matching, and rules for banning relative imports. No suspicious code, external network activity, or malicious behavior is detected. It mainly performs static code analysis and enforces coding standards. The 'banned_modules' configuration can be dynamically set, but this is standard for such plugins and does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate static analysis plugin aimed at improving code quality by banning specific import patterns and enforcing import rules. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware indicators are present. It is a standard implementation with configurable rules, and nothing suspicious is detected.",
