      "conclusion": "The code is a flawed implementation of a package version checker with logical bugs and outdated practices. There is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. The main issue is correcting the bugs to enable proper operation."

The assigned scores are consistent with the code's nature. No further action is necessary; the code appears safe in isolation."
