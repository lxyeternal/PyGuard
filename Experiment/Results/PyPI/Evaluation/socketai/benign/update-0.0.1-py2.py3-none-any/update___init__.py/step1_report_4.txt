  "purpose": "The code imports a 'check' function from the 'update.check' module and defines a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'update.check' module, setting __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None directly present; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static import and variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no suspicious or unusual patterns. The import could be used elsewhere, but alone it is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a module that may be used elsewhere in the package, and defines a version string. There are no visible malicious actions, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded secrets. The presence of 'check' import could be benign or part of update logic, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet appears benign, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It is a minimal, standard module setup without suspicious elements.",
