{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'check' from the module 'update.check' and defines a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'update.check' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output or external connection code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static import and variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function named 'check' from a module, which could perform update checks or other operations, but there is no invocation or use of 'check' shown. The version string is a typical static assignment. The code appears straightforward with no signs of malicious behavior. No external communication, data leakage, or obfuscated code is present. The import alone does not imply malicious intent without additional context.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, involving a simple import and version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior evident.",
