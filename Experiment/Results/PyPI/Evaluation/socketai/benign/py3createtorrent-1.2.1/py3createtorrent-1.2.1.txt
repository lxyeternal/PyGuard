The network fetches and user prompts are standard features, not indicators of malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.15, reflecting minimal, typical operational risks."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, controlled testing harness with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary security consideration is the use of 'shell=True' in subprocess calls, which should be replaced with argument lists for safer practice, but in this context, it does not pose a significant threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2)."
