  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'py3createtorrent'. It handles package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the package version from 'src/py3createtorrent.py' and reads 'README.md' for long description. Retrieves the current directory and file paths for setup.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'setuptools.setup' to configure package installation; no untrusted data flow observed. No dangerous code execution or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Reads version string from the package file; the version is used in setup. Reads long description from markdown file; data flows into package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code are present. No obfuscated or unusual language features are used. The code is standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs file reading and package setup configuration. It reads version info and description files, then supplies them to setuptools. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation is detected. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are identified. All functions and imports are standard for Python packaging. The dependencies are basic, and the package configuration is typical. No anomalies or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk score is low, with no malware detected.",
