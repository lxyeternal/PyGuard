  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'py3createtorrent'.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for description; reads version string from 'src/py3createtorrent.py' by parsing source code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network activity, no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "File reads for description and version; no external data flows or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; uses common practices; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script utilizing setuptools. It reads static files for metadata and version info, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The reliance on parsing the version from source code is standard but could be a concern if the source is compromised; however, no evidence suggests malicious intent. No obfuscation, no external data flows, and no suspicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal risk associated with version parsing is typical and acceptable. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
