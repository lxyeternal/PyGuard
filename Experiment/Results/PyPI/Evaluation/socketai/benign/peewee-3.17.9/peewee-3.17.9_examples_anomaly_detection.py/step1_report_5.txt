{
  "purpose": "The code defines an in-memory SQLite database with a table 'Reg' to store key-value pairs, creates a custom aggregate function 'stddev' to compute standard deviation, populates the table with sample data, and performs statistical analysis to identify outliers based on z-scores.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'values' list during table insertion; the database reads data during query execution, especially when calculating averages and standard deviations.",
  "sinks": "The code executes SQL queries that process the data, but no direct data leaks, external network communication, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'values' list into the database; statistical functions compute mean and stddev from database data; the z-score calculation uses database aggregate results; filtering outliers based on z-scores does not involve external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The custom aggregate function is standard for statistical calculations and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes an in-memory database and defines a table 'Reg'. It then adds a user-defined aggregate 'stddev' for computing standard deviation. Sample data from a list is inserted into the table. A common table expression (CTE) calculates the mean and standard deviation of the dataset. The script then computes z-scores for each value and filters for outliers beyond 2 standard deviations. The process is a typical statistical analysis workflow with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward, with no evidence of data exfiltration, malicious code execution, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs statistical analysis on in-memory data with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not involve external communications, credential handling, or system modifications. The implementation is standard for in-memory data analysis tasks.",
