{
  "purpose": "The code creates an in-memory SQLite database, defines a table, adds data, and performs statistical analysis (mean, standard deviation, z-scores) to identify outliers in the dataset.",
  "sources": "The data source is the list 'values' which is inserted into the database; the database and its query functions are sources of data access.",
  "sinks": "The database query output, especially the calculation of z-scores and filtering based on thresholds, are sinks that process data for analysis; no untrusted input or output is directly exposed outside the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'values' list into the database; then the database computes aggregate functions; the query reads from the database, performs calculations, and filters results based on z-scores.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward, using standard libraries and methods for statistical analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom aggregate function 'stddev' for the database, inserts a fixed dataset, and calculates statistical measures (mean, stddev). It then identifies outliers based on z-scores exceeding ±2. The code uses in-memory database, which is temporary and does not involve external data sources or untrusted input. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unsafe practices, is present. The code's logic is transparent and solely intended for data analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard statistical analysis script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It performs legitimate data processing and analysis tasks without suspicious activity.",
