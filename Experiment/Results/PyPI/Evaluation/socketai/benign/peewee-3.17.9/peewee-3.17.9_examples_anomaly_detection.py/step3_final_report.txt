{
  "purpose": "The code performs statistical analysis using an in-memory SQLite database, defining a custom aggregate function for standard deviation, inserting static data, and identifying outliers based on z-scores exceeding two standard deviations.",
  "sources": "Static list of values inserted into the 'Reg' table; data read from the database during statistical calculations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; no network, file, or credential operations; data remains within the in-memory database and computation scope.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the static list into the database, then through the custom aggregate for stddev, into the CTE for mean and stddev calculation, then to the z-score computation, and finally to the filtering query for outliers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard statistical procedures; no obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code creates an in-memory database, defines a table, implements a correct custom aggregate for standard deviation, inserts static data, computes mean and stddev via a CTE, calculates z-scores, and filters outliers beyond two standard deviations. The logic is straightforward, with no external interactions or malicious intent. The custom aggregate is correctly implemented and used solely for statistical purposes. The data is static and local, minimizing attack surface. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate statistical analysis script with no malicious or suspicious activity. It employs standard practices, with no external data leaks, backdoors, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports—malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1—are appropriate and justified given the benign nature of the code.",
