{
  "purpose": "Implementing and demonstrating the Bellman-Ford algorithm for shortest path computation on an in-memory graph represented with an ORM.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from the in-memory database (Node and Edge records), specifically Node.select(), and retrieving edges via node.outgoing().",
  "sinks": "Potentially printing path results with print_path(), which outputs the shortest path; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from database queries (Node.select(), node.outgoing()) to algorithm computations (dist, pred), and then to output via print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The database is in-memory and used solely for demonstration. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a graph structure using Peewee ORM, sets up nodes and edges, and runs the Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm. Data is read from in-memory database tables, and results are printed. There are no external inputs, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The code functions as an educational demonstration of shortest path algorithms. No suspicious behaviors such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious side-effects are observed. It appears to be a standard implementation with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a graph-based shortest path calculation with clear logic and no malicious or suspicious elements. It is a benign educational example without security concerns.",
