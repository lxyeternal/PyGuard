  "purpose": "Implementing a graph structure and the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find shortest paths between nodes.",
  "sources": "Reading from the database (Node.select(), Node.outgoing()), input parameters for print_path (nodes), and hardcoded data for graph edges.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Database data flows into Node objects; Node objects used in Bellman-Ford for distance calculations; print_path uses the results to display paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no unusual or malicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code creates an in-memory SQLite database and defines a graph structure with nodes and edges. It populates the graph with specific hardcoded edges and weights. The bellman_ford function calculates shortest paths using standard algorithm steps, updating distance and predecessor dictionaries. The print_path function outputs the shortest path between specified nodes. All code operates within normal bounds, using typical database queries, data structures, and algorithms. No suspicious network activity, no hidden backdoors, and no external data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of shortest path algorithms using a relational database as data source. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Overall, it is benign and safe from a security perspective.",
