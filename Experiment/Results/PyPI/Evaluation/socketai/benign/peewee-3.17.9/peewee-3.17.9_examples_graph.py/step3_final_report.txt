  "purpose": "Implementation of a graph with nodes and edges stored in an in-memory SQLite database, performing shortest path calculations using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.",
  "sources": "Database queries retrieving nodes and edges, function parameters for start/end nodes, and the predefined edge list.",
  "sinks": "Output via print statements displaying shortest path routes and distances.",
  "flows": "Data flows from database queries to in-memory structures, then to the Bellman-Ford algorithm, and finally to printed output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. No external inputs or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard ORM models and algorithms for shortest path computation. It reads data from a controlled in-memory database, processes it with a well-known algorithm, and outputs results. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The use of an in-memory database and ORM is typical and safe within this context. The security risk score is minimal (0.1), justified by the in-memory setup but not indicative of actual vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of a shortest path algorithm with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0, and the security risk score of 0.1 is justified given the context. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
