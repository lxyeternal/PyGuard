{
  "purpose": "Implements a graph structure using an ORM to perform shortest path calculations with the Bellman-Ford algorithm.",
  "sources": "Reads database data for nodes, edges, and user-specified start/end nodes.",
  "sinks": "Outputs shortest path results to standard output via print statements.",
  "flows": "Data flows from database query results (nodes, edges) through the Bellman-Ford algorithm computations, culminating in print statements displaying paths and distances.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious data flows. The code uses standard libraries, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an in-memory SQLite database with nodes and edges, then implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find shortest paths. The process involves typical database reads, algorithmic calculations, and printing output. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden network activity, or backdoors. The code is straightforward, focused solely on graph processing and output. It uses standard Python and peewee ORM features without any suspicious or obfuscated parts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal implementation of shortest path algorithms using an ORM for data management. It contains no malicious or suspicious code. It’s safe and performs a typical graph processing task without hidden behaviors.",
