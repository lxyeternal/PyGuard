  "purpose": "Implementing shortest path calculations using the Bellman-Ford algorithm on a graph stored in an in-memory SQLite database via Peewee ORM.",
  "sources": "Reading from in-memory database, executing queries to retrieve nodes and edges, and reading user input in print_path() function (via function parameters).",
  "sinks": "No direct sink that processes untrusted data; only outputs shortest path information via print statements. No external data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Node selection and edge retrieval from the database as source data; the Bellman-Ford algorithm processes these nodes and edges; the print_path() function reads source/destination nodes and outputs results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network activity or system modifications; no obfuscated or unusual code structures; no dynamic code execution. The code uses in-memory database, which is safe in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a graph in an in-memory SQLite database with nodes and edges. It implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm to compute shortest paths. Data is retrieved from the database and processed in-memory. The print_path() function computes and displays shortest paths. No malicious code, data leaks, or malicious behavior is detected. No network activity, no backdoors, no suspicious code patterns, and no obfuscated code. The code appears to be a legitimate shortest path implementation without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of shortest path calculation using Bellman-Ford algorithm with data stored in a local in-memory database. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The overall risk is very low.",
