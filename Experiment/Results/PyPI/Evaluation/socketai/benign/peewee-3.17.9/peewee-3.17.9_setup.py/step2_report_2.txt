  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup script for 'peewee' with optional C extensions, handling Cython support, environment variables, and build errors.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. It performs typical build tasks with error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 seem appropriate given the standard nature of the script. The confidence is high (0.9).\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes the build configuration, dependency checks, and environment handling.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious behavior or malicious activity. The code's purpose is clear and standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment; no concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on environment and dependency checks for building extensions, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior; the script is typical for package setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, describing build configuration, environment checks, and extension compilation.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 are suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct evaluation.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Describes the build setup, environment variable handling, and compilation process.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent or suspicious activity. The code is standard build logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 seem appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Well-founded assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is a typical setup script.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) in some reports, reflecting minimal potential for build-related issues, but no real security threat.\n\n### My Final Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minor risk associated with build failures or misconfigurations, but no security threat.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, and the code is a standard, well-structured build setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
