  "purpose": "Demonstrates use of zlib compression with SQLite full-text search extension in a Python script using Peewee ORM.",
  "sources": "Importing modules (zlib, peewee, playhouse.sqlite_ext), database connection, user-provided phrases (hardcoded in list).",
  "sinks": "Database functions (zlib_compress, zlib_decompress), search queries executed on the database.",
  "flows": "Input data (phrases) is compressed using custom SQLite functions, stored in the database, then decompressed during search results. Data flows from source list to database storage and retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration; use of standard compression and database functions; no obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a database schema with full-text search capabilities and custom compression functions. It creates in-memory database, inserts several phrases, and performs search queries using standard methods. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling observed. Custom functions for compression/decompression are securely implemented and do not contain malicious logic. The code is straightforward, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign demonstration of integrating zlib compression with SQLite full-text search in Python. No malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is safe to use in this context.",
