{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates zlib compression with SQLite full-text search extension using peewee ORM, storing and retrieving predefined phrases.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded phrases assigned to the SearchIndex model, data read during create and search operations.",
  "sinks": "Data stored in the database, retrieved, and printed after decompression; no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "flows": "Phrases are compressed via custom functions, stored in the database, searched, then decompressed and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward example of using custom SQLite functions for compression/decompression with full-text search. It uses static data, no external inputs, and standard libraries. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The custom functions are simple wrappers around zlib, used securely. The data flow is transparent, and the code's purpose is educational or demonstrative.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The use of custom functions does not introduce risk in this context. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero.",
