  "purpose": "Demonstrates the use of zlib compression with SQLite full-text search extension using peewee ORM.",
  "sources": "Reads data from hardcoded list of phrases, user input in search queries, and database functions.",
  "sinks": "Database functions 'zlib_compress' and 'zlib_decompress' which process data for compression/decompression; search query processing.",
  "flows": "Data from phrases flows into the database; database functions compress/decompress data; search queries retrieve and process data using the defined functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom database functions for compression/decompression, but no signs of malicious code or backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data leaks are present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and sets up an in-memory SQLite database with full-text search support. Defines compression and decompression functions with zlib, registered as database functions. Creates a search index table with specified tokenization and compression methods. Inserts a list of phrases into the index. Performs search queries using different ranking algorithms, printing results. The code appears straightforward, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. No untrusted inputs are processed, and the database functions are used solely for compression purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example demonstrating text compression and search features with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It uses standard libraries and practices without suspicious activity.",
