  "purpose": "This script is a test runner and configuration utility for database-related unit tests, providing options to specify database engines and connection parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (USER, PGHOST, PGUSER, PGPASSWORD) and command-line arguments for options and test modules.",
  "sinks": "Sets environment variables based on command-line options; deletes files and directories; invokes unittest framework.",
  "flows": "Input: Command-line options and environment variables -> Sets environment variables for database configs -> Loads and runs tests -> Deletes files/directories based on test results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials; uses environment variables for sensitive info; no unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation; no network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily parses command-line arguments to configure database testing environments, sets environment variables accordingly, runs unit tests via unittest, and cleans up temporary files. Environment variables such as 'USER' are used, but default to safe values. No hardcoded secrets other than defaults are present. The code does not perform any network activity, file writes beyond deletion, or contain any obfuscated or suspicious code blocks. It uses standard libraries and patterns appropriate for test runners. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a safe test runner and environment configurator without malicious intent. No indicators of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks identified. The code appears well-structured for its purpose, with no suspicious or harmful actions.",
