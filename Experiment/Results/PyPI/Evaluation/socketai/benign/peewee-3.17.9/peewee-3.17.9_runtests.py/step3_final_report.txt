  "purpose": "A Python script functioning as a test runner for database-related tests, configuring environment variables for database connections, executing test modules, and cleaning up test artifacts.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for database credentials and test configuration, command-line arguments for test selection, filesystem for cleanup routines.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables potentially exposing sensitive info, filesystem deletion of test artifacts, dynamic test loading.",
  "flows": "Environment variables set from command-line options influence test environment; test modules loaded and executed; cleanup routines delete specific files/directories post-test.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets are placeholders, no network activity, no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test harness that configures environment variables for database testing, loads and runs tests, and performs cleanup. It uses environment variables for sensitive data, which is typical in testing environments. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The cleanup routines are straightforward, deleting known test artifacts. No network activity or suspicious behavior is evident. The code structure is clear, and the logic is standard for such testing scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, benign test runner used for database testing in Python projects. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The environment variable usage for credentials is typical but should be managed securely in production. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as 0. The risk score of approximately 0.1 reflects the low but present concern of environment variable handling of sensitive info, which is standard practice in testing scripts.",
