  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard test runner setup; environment variables, command-line args, filesystem for cleanup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Sets environment variables, runs tests, cleans up files.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity; uses placeholders for passwords; cleanup routine targets specific test artifacts.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a typical test harness, with no malicious behavior. No data leaks, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard test runner.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; environment variables, command-line options, filesystem cleanup.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious actions; environment variables used for configuration are standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Configures database backends via environment variables; cleanup routines.\n- **Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious actions; standard setup and cleanup.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate testing utility; no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 are suitable.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly reflects the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports; environment variables for database testing, cleanup routines.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity; uses environment variables, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard test runner.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 are appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern; configuration via environment variables, test execution, cleanup.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; environment variables used for credentials are typical.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate testing script.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem correct.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) in all cases, reflecting low but non-zero risk due to environment variable handling of credentials and filesystem cleanup routines.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and readable.  \n**Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk associated with environment variable usage and filesystem cleanup routines, which are standard in test scripts.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No changes to scores are necessary. The code appears to be a standard, legitimate test harness with no malicious intent.",
