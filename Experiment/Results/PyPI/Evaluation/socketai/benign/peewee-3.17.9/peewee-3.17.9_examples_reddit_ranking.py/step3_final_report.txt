  "purpose": "Create an in-memory SQLite database, define a Post model, populate it with static data, and compute a 'hotness' score based on votes and timestamps for display, with no external input or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Static data inserted into the database; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "Outputting post content and computed scores via print statements; no data leaks or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static insertions into the database, through ORM queries, into score calculations, and finally to printed output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom SQL function 'log' wrapping math.log is standard; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a simple ranking system based on votes and timestamps, using standard mathematical functions and ORM queries. It does not accept external input, perform network operations, or manipulate files. The custom 'log' function is a safe wrapper around Python's math.log, exposed to SQL via peewee. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The static data and straightforward calculations confirm benign intent. The scores assigned in the provided reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of a post-ranking algorithm with no malicious or security issues. It uses standard practices, with no external data or network activity. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, reflecting its safe nature.",
