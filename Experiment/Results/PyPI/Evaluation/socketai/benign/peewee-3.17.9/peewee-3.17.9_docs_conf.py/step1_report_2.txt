  "purpose": "Configuration script for generating documentation using Sphinx for the 'peewee' project.",
  "sources": "Imports 'sys', 'os', and dynamically retrieves '__version__' from the 'peewee' package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted input or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The script primarily sets configuration variables and inserts paths; it imports version info from 'peewee'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors; commented-out code and standard setup are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious or suspicious logic. It imports system modules and the version of the 'peewee' package to set up documentation parameters. No external data is fetched or transmitted. The code contains only configuration settings for documentation generation, with no signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical configuration file for Sphinx documentation with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears safe and benign.",
