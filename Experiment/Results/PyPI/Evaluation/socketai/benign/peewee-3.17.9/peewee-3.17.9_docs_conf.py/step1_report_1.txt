  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation generation for the 'peewee' project, including theme, paths, and project metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads project version from 'peewee' package, reads environment and filesystem paths, imports 'peewee' to access '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks, system commands, or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Imports '__version__' from 'peewee' module to set version variables; reads filesystem paths; configures documentation options.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs detected. The code appears to be standard Sphinx configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file with no evident malicious behavior. It imports necessary modules, sets paths, theme options, and project info. It reads the project version from the 'peewee' package, which is normal for such configurations. No system commands, network operations, or data leaks are present. The code does not contain any dynamic code execution, obfuscated elements, or suspicious constructs. All operations are static and typical for documentation setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate configuration file for Sphinx documentation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use and does not include any malicious or harmful behavior.",
