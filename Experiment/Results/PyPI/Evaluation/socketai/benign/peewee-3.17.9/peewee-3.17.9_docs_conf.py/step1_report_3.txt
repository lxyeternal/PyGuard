  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation of the 'peewee' project.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'sys', 'os', and '__version__' from 'peewee' module; os.path functions for directory paths.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file writing, or system commands; no untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Initialization and configuration data flow; no dynamic execution, external input, or untrusted data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code consists solely of static configuration parameters and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file. It imports system modules and the '__version__' attribute from the 'peewee' package to set version info. There are no dynamic or potentially malicious operations. The code does not handle external inputs, nor does it perform network or file operations beyond static configuration. All code appears benign, serving only to configure documentation generation.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign configuration script for documentation purposes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely sets up static parameters and imports project metadata.",
