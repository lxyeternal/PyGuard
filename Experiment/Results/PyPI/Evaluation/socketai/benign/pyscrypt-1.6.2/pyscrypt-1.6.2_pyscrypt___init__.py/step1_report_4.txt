{
  "purpose": "Implement a pure-Python version of the scrypt password-based key derivation function, primarily for reference or environments where C wrappers are not allowed.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .file (InvalidScryptFileFormat, ScryptFile), .hash (hash).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data output, network communication, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code defines imports, constants, and exports functions and classes without processing runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; comments suggest purpose and limitations clearly.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of licensing information, descriptive comments, and import statements. It defines a version list and an __all__ export for module API exposure. There are no functions, data processing, input handling, or other operations within this snippet that could pose security issues. The comments indicate this is a reference implementation, slow by design, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, well-documented module setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is intended as a reference implementation of scrypt in Python, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
