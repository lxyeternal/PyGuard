{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a pure-Python scrypt password-based key derivation function, primarily for reference and environments without C wrapper support.",
  "sources": "Imports modules '.file' and '.hash', which may contain additional code and potentially untrusted data handling.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules ('.file' and '.hash') to the functions and classes exposed ('hash', 'InvalidScryptFileFormat', 'ScryptFile').",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code appears to be straightforward, providing cryptographic functionality with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily license and documentation, setting up a Python implementation of scrypt with minimal logic. It imports local modules and exposes certain functions and classes. No code execution, data processing, or network operations are present that could indicate malicious activity. The implementation is intended for reference use, not for production security-sensitive applications. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-documented implementation of scrypt with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a reference cryptographic module. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
