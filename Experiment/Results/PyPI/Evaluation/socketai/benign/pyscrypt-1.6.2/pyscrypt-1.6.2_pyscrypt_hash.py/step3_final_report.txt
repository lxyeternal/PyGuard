  "purpose": "Implementation of cryptographic primitives including PBKDF2 (single iteration), Salsa20/8 stream cipher, and scrypt for key derivation and encryption.",
  "sources": "Input data includes password and salt parameters, read from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication; cryptographic functions process data internally without leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input password and salt flow through PBKDF2, then into scrypt functions, with intermediate data processed within cryptographic routines without external exposure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual data flows detected. Implementation appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cryptographic algorithms with proper structure and documentation. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The cryptographic functions are consistent with reputable algorithms. The use of a single PBKDF2 iteration is insecure in practice but does not indicate malicious intent. Compatibility checks for Python 2 and 3 are standard. Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cryptographic utility implementing well-known algorithms. It shows no malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.2), primarily due to cryptographic limitations rather than malicious activity.",
