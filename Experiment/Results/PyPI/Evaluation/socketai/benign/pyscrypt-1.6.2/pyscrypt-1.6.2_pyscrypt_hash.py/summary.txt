  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cryptographic utility implementing well-known algorithms. It shows no malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.2), primarily due to cryptographic limitations rather than malicious activity."
