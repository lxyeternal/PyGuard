  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cryptographic utility implementing scrypt and Salsa20/8, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal. No adjustments are necessary; the code is safe for use."
