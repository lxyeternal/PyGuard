  "purpose": "Cryptographic hash testing using static test vectors for pyscrypt.",
  "sources": "Static test data within the script, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to stdout via print statements.",
  "flows": "Static data flows into the hash function, results are compared and printed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'sys.path += \"..\"' which is unusual and could be suspicious; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward cryptographic test suite with hardcoded vectors and simple print outputs. The modification of sys.path is atypical but common in testing environments; no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code is clear, well-structured, and performs only intended cryptographic validation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, performing cryptographic tests without malicious intent. The minor sys.path modification is a potential vector for malicious module loading but appears benign in this context. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk.",
