{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to test the functionality of the pyscrypt library by executing multiple password hashing tests and printing the pass/fail result for each test.",
  "sources": "The code reads test data from a predefined list 'Tests', including passwords, salts, and expected hash results.",
  "sinks": "The code prints output to the console using print statements; it does not directly write or transmit data to external sources.",
  "flows": "The test data is taken from the 'Tests' list (source) and processed through pyscrypt.hash() (sink) to generate hashes, then results are compared to expected outputs, and outcomes are printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials beyond test data, no network activity, no code obfuscation, and no use of environment variables or external inputs in a suspicious manner.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and modifies sys.path to include parent directory, then imports pyscrypt. It prints the version, defines multiple test cases for the pyscrypt hashing function, and performs the tests by hashing the input passwords and comparing the results to expected hashes. It contains compatibility code for Python 2 and 3 but no malicious or suspicious code segments. The code is straightforward, with no hidden or obfuscated logic, and primarily serves as a test suite for the pyscrypt library. The presence of commented-out code and conditional blocks for potential alternative implementations does not indicate malicious intent. The print statements are used for output only, with no network or file I/O involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite designed to verify the correctness of the pyscrypt hashing library. It does not contain malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity. There are no indications of supply chain threats or malware within this module.",
