  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard AES in CTR mode implementation with proper self-testing routines. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the cryptographic context and routine self-tests."
