{
  "purpose": "Implement AES encryption and decryption in Counter Mode, along with testing against the PyCrypto library implementation.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'os.urandom' for key and plaintext generation; reads environment during import; reads from standard modules like copy and struct.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present in the code that handle untrusted data for malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Generates cryptographic keys and plaintexts using 'os.urandom'; encrypts/decrypts data with internal AES class; compares with external library outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No evidence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code performs cryptographic operations and testing. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or privacy violations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a self-contained AES implementation with various round constants, S-box, transformation tables, and key expansion. It includes a class for AES encryption in CTR mode, which properly handles counter increment and encryption. The main section tests the implementation against the PyCrypto library, generating random keys and plaintexts via 'os.urandom'. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. All cryptographic functions and comparisons appear legitimate and standard for testing cryptographic correctness. No obfuscation or signs of malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The source code appears to be a legitimate implementation of AES encryption and decryption with proper testing against a known library. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this module. It functions as a cryptographic utility with no evidence of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
