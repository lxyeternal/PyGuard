  "purpose": "Implementation of AES encryption in CTR mode with self-testing routines against PyCrypto's AES-CTR, supporting Python 2 and 3, using 'os.urandom' for key and plaintext generation during tests.",
  "sources": "Function parameters for plaintext, key generation via 'os.urandom', internal data structures for key expansion and encryption routines.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious data flows; all data flows are confined within the module during self-tests.",
  "flows": "Input plaintext and key flow into encryption routines; self-tests compare outputs against trusted library; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; standard cryptographic implementation with routine self-tests.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard AES implementation supporting multiple key sizes, with self-test routines verifying correctness against PyCrypto's AES-CTR. It employs known cryptographic tables and transformations, with no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of 'os.urandom' for key and plaintext during testing is standard practice. No external data leaks or network activity are present. The implementation appears correct, transparent, and consistent with best practices in cryptography.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard AES in CTR mode implementation with proper self-testing routines. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the cryptographic context and routine self-tests.",
