  "purpose": "Implementation of AES encryption and AES-CTR mode encryption/decryption for cryptographic operations, including testing against the PyCrypto library.",
  "sources": "User input is not directly read; input data is received via function parameters. Data is generated internally for tests using os.urandom.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted data output, print statements for test results, and potential exceptions. No evident data leaks or untrusted data flows are observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (plaintext) is encrypted via AES-CTR mode, and test comparisons are made against external library results. No external data flows or data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; all cryptographic parameters are generated at runtime. The code appears to perform standard cryptographic functions without obfuscation or malicious tricks. The only notable aspect is the self-test against external crypto library, which is typical for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard AES implementation, including key expansion, block encryption, and counter mode operations. It uses pre-defined S-boxes and transformation tables, typical for AES. The 'if __name__ == '__main__'' block performs runtime testing against the PyCrypto library's AES in CTR mode, generating random keys and plaintexts, and comparing outputs for correctness. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, network communication, or system modification is evident. The cryptographic implementation appears conventional and intended for secure encryption purposes. No suspicious anomalies or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of AES and AES-CTR mode, primarily for testing and validation purposes. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks beyond standard cryptographic operations. The self-test against an external library suggests correctness rather than malicious intent. Overall, the package appears benign and focused on cryptographic functionality.",
