{
  "purpose": "The source code implements AES encryption and decryption in Counter Mode (CTR) with compatibility for Python 2 and 3, including self-test routines comparing against the PyCrypto library.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'plaintext' parameter of encrypt/decrypt methods, and reads the key from the constructor argument during object initialization.",
  "sinks": "Processes input data for encryption/decryption, and uses os.urandom to generate cryptographically secure random keys and plaintexts for testing.",
  "flows": "Input plaintext flows into the encrypt/decrypt methods, which process it through AES transformations. Random keys generated by os.urandom are used for testing, and the internal counter state is maintained for encryption/decryption.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no backdoors or suspicious code. The code performs standard AES CTR encryption, with proper counter incrementation and cryptographic practices. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or privacy violations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of AES in CTR mode, with appropriate key expansion, S-box substitution, and counter incrementation. It includes compatibility functions for different Python versions. The self-test routine verifies encryption correctness against the PyCrypto library using securely generated random keys and plaintexts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or secret theft. The code appears to be a legitimate cryptography utility.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, well-structured AES CTR implementation with self-testing against a trusted library. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage. The security risk is minimal, and no indicators of malware are present.",
