  "purpose": "A setup script for packaging the 'pyscrypt' Python library, defining package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields such as name, version, description, author, url, classifiers, and license.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Static data assignment; no dynamic data flow or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static setup code with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using 'distutils.core.setup' with hardcoded package information. No dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscated content is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of deprecated 'distutils' is noted but not a security concern. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent across all evaluations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
