  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward setup script for the 'pyscrypt' package.\n- They identify no dynamic input, no network activity, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior.\n- The code uses the deprecated 'distutils.core.setup', but this is not malicious, just outdated.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is a standard package setup script with static metadata.\n- No issues are present in the code based on the provided source.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The use of 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools' is noted but not problematic.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all reports agree on no malicious or suspicious activity, the risk score should remain at 0.\n- No reason exists to elevate the risk score based on the provided code.\n\n### Malware score:\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, so malware score should be 0.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities:\n- No vulnerabilities are claimed or implied.\n- The code is static and standard.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n### Additional notes:\n- While the code uses deprecated packaging tools, this does not introduce security risks.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough; no changes needed.\n\n**In conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
