  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pyscrypt' Python package, used for packaging and distribution of the library.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata such as name, version, description, author information, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; primarily defines package configuration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded package metadata to the setup() function for package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration that imports distutils for package setup. It defines package metadata such as name, version, description, author info, URL, classifiers, and license. The code is straightforward, with no external data input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors or anomalies. It is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It contains no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. It appears safe and intended for package distribution purposes.",
