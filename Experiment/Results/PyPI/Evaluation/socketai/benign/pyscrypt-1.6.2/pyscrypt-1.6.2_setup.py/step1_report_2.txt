  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'pyscrypt' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "The script reads metadata for package configuration, such as name, version, description, author info, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling points; the script does not process user input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; it simply supplies static package metadata to the setup function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard setup procedures without obfuscated or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'distutils.core.setup' to define package setup parameters. It defines package metadata with no dynamic or untrusted input. No code injection, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. All elements are standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely provides package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
