  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pyscrypt' package, providing package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals and package metadata; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed. Uses standard setup procedure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using distutils to define package information such as name, version, description, author, URL, and classifiers. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. No hardcoded credentials beyond package metadata, which is typical. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security issues identified. It functions solely to define package metadata for distribution purposes.",
