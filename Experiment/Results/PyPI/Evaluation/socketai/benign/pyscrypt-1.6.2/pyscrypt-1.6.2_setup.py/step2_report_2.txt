  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code is a straightforward, static setup script for a Python package.\n- No external data sources, dynamic code, or network activity are involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, and the risk scores are very low or zero, indicating no perceived security threat.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or anomalies:**\n   - The code is a standard `setup()` invocation using `distutils.core`.\n   - No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n   - No suspicious behavior or logic.\n\n2. **Use of deprecated modules:**\n   - The use of `distutils.core` is noted; modern best practices favor `setuptools`. However, this is not malicious—just a deprecation note.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code.\n\n4. **Claims about vulnerabilities:**\n   - No claims are made beyond the code being a benign setup script.\n   - No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are present.\n\n5. **Consistency and justification:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No need to adjust scores.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain **0**; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain **0**; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain **0**; no security risk identified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the evidence, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a typical package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Justification |\n|-----------------|------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| 0               | 0                | 0            | No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior detected. The code is a standard, static setup script. |\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the code is safe, consider updating to `setuptools` in future package distributions for compatibility and best practices, but this does not impact security.",
