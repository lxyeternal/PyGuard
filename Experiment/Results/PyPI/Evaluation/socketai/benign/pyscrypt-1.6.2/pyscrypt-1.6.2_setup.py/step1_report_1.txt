{
  "purpose": "The code is used for setting up a Python package named 'pyscrypt' for distribution, including metadata such as version, description, author, and URL.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of package metadata; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data; no data leaks or dangerous operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration without dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets beyond typical package metadata; use of deprecated distutils.core for setup (not malicious, but noteworthy), no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'distutils.core' module to define package setup parameters. It specifies package information such as name, version, description, author, and URL in a straightforward manner. There are no external data inputs, environment variable usage, or network operations. The code performs a standard package setup process, with no signs of malicious behavior or code obfuscation. The use of 'distutils' is standard, although 'setuptools' is preferred in modern Python packaging. Overall, the code is simple, declarative, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It contains no obfuscated or malicious code segments and does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
