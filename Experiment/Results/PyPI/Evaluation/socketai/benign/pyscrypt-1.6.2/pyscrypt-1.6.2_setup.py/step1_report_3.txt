{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package called 'pyscrypt' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Constants and string variables such as LONG_DESCRIPTION, and metadata fields in the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup configuration is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python 'distutils' to define package metadata. It contains static strings and setup parameters without any dynamic or external input processing. No code injection, network activity, or credential handling is present. The code follows typical package setup conventions without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward setup script for distributing a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
