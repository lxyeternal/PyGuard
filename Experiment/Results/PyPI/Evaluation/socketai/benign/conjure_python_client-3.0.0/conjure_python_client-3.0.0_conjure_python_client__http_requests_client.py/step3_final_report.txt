{
  "purpose": "This code implements a secure HTTP client with retry logic, TLS configuration, distributed trace ID propagation, and custom error handling for service-to-service communication.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from request headers, parameters, and response JSON content.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could flow into network requests, headers, and response parsing, but no malicious data is identified.",
  "flows": "Trace ID generation via os.urandom() flows into request headers; request data flows through the session request method; error handling captures response content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of random for jitter is standard but could be replaced with cryptographically secure methods for absolute security.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard secure practices: cryptographically secure trace ID generation, explicit TLS cipher configuration, proper request timeout and verification, and detailed error handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. Use of 'random' for jitter and URI selection is acceptable for non-cryptographic purposes. The code structure is clear, well-documented, and aligns with best practices for secure HTTP clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of an HTTP client designed for internal service communication. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the security risk is low. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
