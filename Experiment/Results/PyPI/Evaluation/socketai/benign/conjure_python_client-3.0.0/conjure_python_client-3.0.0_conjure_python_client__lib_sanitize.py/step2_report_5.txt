  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The function `sanitize_identifier` takes a string `identifier`.\n- It checks if `identifier` is in a predefined list of Python keywords.\n- If it is, it appends an underscore (`_`) to avoid conflicts.\n- If not, it returns the identifier unchanged.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external dependencies, no network activity, and no data leaks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The purpose is purely to prevent syntax errors when identifiers conflict with Python keywords.\n- The logic is simple and correct for this purpose.\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no anomalies or malicious intent.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The only minor issue is a typo in the docstring (\"santized\" instead of \"sanitized\"), which is not security-related or malicious.\n- No other flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which is accurate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for Risk Score:\n- The overall security risk score is 0, which is appropriate.\n- No potential vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The function is a utility for code correctness, not security.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- They do not assume malicious intent or vulnerabilities that do not exist.\n- The code does not process untrusted data in a way that could lead to security issues beyond correctness.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple, benign utility with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The purpose is straightforward, and the implementation is correct and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is safe, with no security risks or malware indications. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
