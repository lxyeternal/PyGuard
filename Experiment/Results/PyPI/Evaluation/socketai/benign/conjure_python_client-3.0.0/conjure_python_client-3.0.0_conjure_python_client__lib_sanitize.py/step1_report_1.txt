  "purpose": "Sanitize Python identifiers that are Python keywords by appending an underscore.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'identifier' received by the function.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a modified string, but no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "Input 'identifier' flows through a conditional check against the 'keywords' tuple; if matched, an underscore is appended, else returned unchanged.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and performs a simple check and modification.",
  "analysis": "The function defines a list of Python keywords and checks if the input string matches any of them. If so, it appends an underscore to avoid conflicts with Python reserved keywords. The implementation is simple, direct, and does not perform any data leaks, network operations, or dangerous code execution. No suspicious or malicious activity is present. The purpose appears to be code correctness and avoiding syntax errors with reserved keywords.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for sanitizing identifiers to prevent conflicts with Python keywords. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
