  "purpose": "Utility function to append an underscore to Python keywords to prevent syntax conflicts when using identifiers that are reserved keywords.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'identifier' which is checked against the list of keywords.",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs either the original identifier or the modified identifier with an underscore.",
  "flows": "The function receives 'identifier', checks if it is in the keywords list, then returns either 'identifier' or 'identifier_' based on the check.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in the docstring ('santized' instead of 'sanitized'), but no malicious or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that compares the input string to a list of Python keywords. If a match is found, it appends an underscore to avoid conflicts; otherwise, it returns the input unchanged. No external dependencies, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The logic is correct and simple, with no anomalies or security issues. The purpose is to prevent syntax errors when generating or manipulating code identifiers. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The typo in the docstring is trivial and does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, simple utility function with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate and justified. The reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
