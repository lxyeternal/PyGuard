{
  "purpose": "The function 'sanitize_identifier' is designed to modify Python keywords by appending an underscore to prevent conflicts when used as identifiers.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'identifier', which is a string provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs the sanitized identifier; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The function takes 'identifier' as input and either returns it unchanged or with an underscore appended if it matches a Python keyword.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected. The list of keywords appears standard and there are no obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports no external modules, processes only a provided string 'identifier', and performs a straightforward check against a list of Python keywords. It then either returns the original identifier or appends an underscore if it's a keyword. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code is simple, well-structured, and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for sanitizing identifiers by avoiding Python keywords. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
