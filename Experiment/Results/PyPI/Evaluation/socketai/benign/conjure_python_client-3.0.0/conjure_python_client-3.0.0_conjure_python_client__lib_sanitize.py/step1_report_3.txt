{
  "purpose": "This code provides a utility function to sanitize Python identifiers that are reserved keywords by appending an underscore.",
  "sources": "Input is the 'identifier' string parameter passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a modified string based on input; no untrusted data is directly used or stored in a sensitive sink.",
  "flows": "The input identifier is checked against a list of keywords; if it matches, an underscore is appended; otherwise, the original identifier is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The list of keywords appears standard, and the function performs a straightforward check.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of Python keywords and provides a function to append an underscore to any identifier that matches these keywords. The purpose is to avoid naming conflicts when generating or manipulating identifiers programmatically. The logic is simple, direct, and does not involve any network operations, external data sources, or security-sensitive actions. The code does not contain any signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for sanitizing Python identifiers to prevent conflicts with keywords. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected.",
