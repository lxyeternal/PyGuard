{
  "purpose": "The function 'sanitize_identifier' is designed to modify Python identifiers that are keywords, appending an underscore to avoid conflicts with reserved keywords.",
  "sources": "Input source is the parameter 'identifier' passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a sanitized identifier string; there are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Input 'identifier' is checked against a list of keywords; if matched, an underscore is appended. The flow is straightforward and does not involve untrusted data flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a typo in the docstring ('santized' instead of 'sanitized'), but this is not malicious. No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of Python keywords and checks if the provided identifier matches any of them. If so, it appends an underscore; otherwise, it returns the identifier unchanged. This function is simple, with no external inputs besides the 'identifier' parameter. It does not perform any dangerous operations, external network activity, or data leakage. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility function to avoid keyword conflicts in Python identifiers. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
