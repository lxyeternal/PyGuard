  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple utility function to append an underscore to Python keywords.\n- The logic is straightforward: check if the input matches a keyword, then modify accordingly.\n- No external inputs besides the 'identifier' parameter.\n- No network activity, data leaks, or external dependencies.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious code constructs, or malicious intent are identified.\n- The purpose is to prevent syntax errors or conflicts when generating or manipulating code identifiers.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as expected.\n- The security risk score is 0, since the code doesn't perform any dangerous operations.\n- The purpose and analysis are consistent across reports.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only minor point is a typo in the second report's docstring ('santized' instead of 'sanitized'), but this is trivial and not malicious.\n- The list of keywords is comprehensive for Python 3.x, and the check is straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, straightforward utility function with no malicious activity.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The overall risk is negligible.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is clear and simple.\n- **Risk score:** 0, no security risk or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The code is safe and does not warrant any concern.\n- The consistent scoring across reports is justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign utility function.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The analysis confirms the code's safety and correctness.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further analysis or details.",
