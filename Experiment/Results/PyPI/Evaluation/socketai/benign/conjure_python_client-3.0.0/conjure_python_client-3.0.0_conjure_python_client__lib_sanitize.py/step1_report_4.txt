{
  "purpose": "The function 'sanitize_identifier' is designed to modify Python identifiers that are reserved keywords by appending an underscore to avoid syntax errors.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'identifier', which is a string provided to the function.",
  "targets": "The returned identifier string; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The source 'identifier' is checked against the list of keywords, and based on this, the output is either the original identifier or a modified version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behavior detected. The function performs a straightforward check and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of Python reserved keywords and checks if the input string matches any of them. If it does, it appends an underscore to avoid conflicts with Python syntax; otherwise, it returns the input as-is. The code is simple, clear, and does not include any obfuscation, malicious logic, or insecure patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for sanitizing identifiers that are Python keywords. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this code fragment.",
