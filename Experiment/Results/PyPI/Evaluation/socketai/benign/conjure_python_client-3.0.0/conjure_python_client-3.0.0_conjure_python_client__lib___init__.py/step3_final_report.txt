  "purpose": "The code defines type imports and an export list for a Python module, likely part of a larger schema or API framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the import statement 'from .types import *'.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or external data outputs in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only imports and exposes symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module with licensing comments, a simple import statement, and an __all__ list. It appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The provided reports are empty, indicating no detailed findings or evidence of issues. Given the lack of any suspicious activity or anomalies, the code is considered safe. The absence of data and reports suggests no malicious intent or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured module with no malicious or vulnerable elements. The reports are incomplete and do not indicate any issues. Therefore, the overall security risk is negligible, and malware likelihood is zero.",
