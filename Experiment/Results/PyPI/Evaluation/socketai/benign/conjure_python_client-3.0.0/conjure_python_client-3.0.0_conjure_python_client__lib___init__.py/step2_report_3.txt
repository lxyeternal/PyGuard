  "review": "Let's analyze this systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The provided code is a standard Python module with import statements, an `__all__` declaration, and licensing comments.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities within this snippet.\n   - The code appears to be a typical type definitions module, likely part of a larger codebase.\n\n2. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.\n   - There are no details, errors, or descriptions provided in these reports.\n   - Without actual report content, it is impossible to identify any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity based solely on the reports.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report Logic:**\n   - The reports are incomplete; they do not contain any information beyond \"Empty response.\"\n   - This suggests either a failure in report generation or an issue in data collection, not necessarily an issue with the code itself.\n   - No reasoning or claims are presented to evaluate.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Since no specific issues are described, assigning high malware or risk scores is unwarranted.\n   - The lack of information means the scores should be minimal or zero.\n   - Any higher scores would be unjustified without evidence.\n\n5. **Malware and Obfuscation:**\n   - The code is straightforward, licensed, and contains no suspicious patterns.\n   - The reports do not provide any indication of malicious activity.\n   - Therefore, malware score should be zero.\n\n6. **Potential Vulnerabilities:**\n   - No claims or assumptions are made in the reports.\n   - The code itself appears safe and standard.\n   - No vulnerabilities are apparent from the snippet.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - Given the lack of evidence, the scores should reflect an absence of issues.\n   - The reports do not provide enough data to adjust scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Review:** No issues or malicious activity detected.\n- **Report Content:** Insufficient data; reports are empty.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n  - **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation detected)\n  - **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no identified vulnerabilities or risks)\n\n### Summary:\nBased on the provided code and reports, there is no indication of a security incident or malicious activity. The reports are incomplete, and no issues can be inferred. The scores should be at the lowest levels, reflecting no detected threats.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** Maintain scores at zero unless further detailed reports are provided.",
