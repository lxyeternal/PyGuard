  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a typical Python module with licensing information, import statements, and an `__all__` list defining exported symbols.\n   - The code appears to be a part of a larger codebase, likely defining types for a schema or API framework.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities within this snippet.\n   - The import statement `from .types import *` suggests reliance on external or sibling modules, but nothing suspicious is evident here.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response content.\n   - There are no details, errors, or explanations provided beyond the \"Empty response\" message.\n   - This suggests that the reports may be incomplete, missing critical information such as the actual report content, code snippets, or analysis.\n\n3. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n   - Since all reports are empty, there's no basis for evaluating claims about vulnerabilities, malware, or code flaws.\n   - The lack of detail prevents any meaningful analysis or validation of potential issues.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Without specific findings, assigning high malware or risk scores is unwarranted.\n   - The absence of evidence means the malware score should be very low or zero.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be minimal unless there's evidence of obfuscation, which there isn't.\n   - The overall risk score should be low, given no identified issues.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - Since the reports contain no data, any assumptions about malicious intent or vulnerabilities are unfounded.\n   - It’s important to note that an empty report does not imply safety; it merely indicates a lack of information.\n\n6. **Conclusion and Recommendations:**\n   - The code snippet itself appears benign.\n   - The reports are incomplete; further detailed reports are necessary to perform a thorough review.\n   - Based on current information, I would assign:\n     - **Malware score:** 0.0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n     - **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation detected)\n     - **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to lack of information but no evident issues)\n\n**Final thoughts:**  \nGiven the data, there's no reason to suspect malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The reports are essentially placeholders or incomplete. For a more accurate assessment, detailed report content is necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- No issues present in the code snippet.\n- Reports are empty; no analysis possible.\n- Scores should be minimal due to lack of evidence.\n\nWould you like me to suggest steps for obtaining more detailed reports or further analysis?",
