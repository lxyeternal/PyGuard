  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script, reads version info from filesystem and git, executes version file.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Executes subprocess for git, writes version info, executes version file.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard subprocess/file operations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All functions serve typical package setup tasks. No malicious behavior detected. The use of subprocess and exec is common in build scripts.\n- **Confidence:** 1, malware: 0, risk: 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with emphasis on versioning via git and code formatting.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses subprocess and exec, but these are standard for such scripts.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity; the dynamic execution of version info is typical.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, malware: 0, risk: 0.2 (minimal).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Version extraction from git, formatting with 'black'.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious credentials or obfuscation; subprocess and exec are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical build script; no malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, malware: 0, risk: 0.1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup, versioning, and formatting.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, typical subprocess usage.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Normal package setup script.\n- **Confidence:** 1, malware: 0, risk: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with version extraction and code formatting.\n- **Anomalies:** No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard setup script.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, malware: 0, risk: 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently 0, as the code performs legitimate build, versioning, and formatting tasks.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, primarily due to the use of subprocess and exec, but these are standard in build scripts and pose no actual risk in this context.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code relies on well-understood, standard practices for package versioning and formatting.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- The dynamic execution of the version file (`exec`) is typical in such scripts, not malicious.\n- Use of subprocess to call 'git' and 'black' is standard and controlled.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to subprocess and exec, but in a controlled build environment, this is minimal)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious or security issues.",
