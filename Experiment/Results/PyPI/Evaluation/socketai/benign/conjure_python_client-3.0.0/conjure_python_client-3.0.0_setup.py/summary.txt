  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign package setup script that handles versioning and formatting. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The use of subprocess and exec() is standard and controlled, posing minimal security risk. The scores should reflect no malware (0), no obfuscation (0), and a very low risk (~0.1) due to controlled subprocess and exec usage."
