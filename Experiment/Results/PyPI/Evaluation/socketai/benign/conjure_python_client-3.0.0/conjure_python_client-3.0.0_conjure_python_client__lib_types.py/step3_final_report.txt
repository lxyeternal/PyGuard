{
  "purpose": "Defines data types, schemas, and utility classes for data serialization and validation in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Internal modules '.case' and '.sanitize' used for string manipulation and sanitization.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; primarily class attribute assignments and type definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; code consists of class definitions and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs; straightforward class and type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of data modeling classes, enums, and type wrappers with no runtime data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It relies on internal utility modules, but their implementation is not provided; however, their usage appears standard. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk near zero) are consistent with the benign and structural nature of the code. The code's purpose is to facilitate data serialization and validation, with no external data input or output that could be exploited. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and free of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data modeling library with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
