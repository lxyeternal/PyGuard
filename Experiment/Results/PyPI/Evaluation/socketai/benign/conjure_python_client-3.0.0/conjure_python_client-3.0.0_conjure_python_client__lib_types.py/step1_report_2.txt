{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of classes and types for handling data schemas and type definitions, likely for serialization/deserialization or data validation within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, class definitions, and type annotations. No external data input or user data reading is present.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data leads to security effects, such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The code does not implement runtime data flows; it mainly defines data structures and class methods for schema management.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code contains only class definitions, type hints, and simple methods.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of class and type definitions for schema modeling, including enums, generic types, and data validation structures. It imports external modules but does not perform any data processing, I/O operations, or system interactions. There are no dynamic code execution, obfuscated segments, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured schema definition module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign schema and type definition module used for data modeling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is safe for use as part of a larger application.",
