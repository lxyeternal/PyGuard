{
  "purpose": "This code primarily exports classes and exceptions related to configuration and HTTP request handling, likely for a client library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .configuration and .requests_client",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external communication within this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks observed; the code only imports and defines __all__",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes and exceptions from local submodules and defines an __all__ list for export. It contains licensing comments and no executable logic or external data handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The structure indicates it’s part of a larger package, acting as an interface or API surface.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign module primarily for organizing exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code fragment.",
