  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple module that imports classes and functions from local modules (.configuration and .requests_client) and exports them via __all__.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or external input handling is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be a standard, benign part of a larger package, serving as an interface or API surface.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward, clear code.\n- **Security risk scores:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The code itself is very simple and does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n- Since the code is only importing and exporting components, there is no indication of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Assessment of the reports:**\n- The reasoning in each report is sound and consistent.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all cases, which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- No report suggests any suspicious behavior or potential vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n- The code fragment is benign.\n- The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate.\n- There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard module setup with no security concerns. It does not introduce any vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
