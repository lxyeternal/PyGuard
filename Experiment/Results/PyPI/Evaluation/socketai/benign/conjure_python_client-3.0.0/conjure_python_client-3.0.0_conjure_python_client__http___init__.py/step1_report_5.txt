{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports configuration and request client classes related to network services, likely for establishing secure connections and handling HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules (.configuration and .requests_client). No external input reading detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or potentially leaks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The license and copyright comments are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports specific classes and functions from local modules and defines an __all__ list for exports. It contains no runtime logic, no input handling, no data processing, and no network or system calls. Its purpose is likely to serve as an interface or API layer for other modules. No malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module primarily consisting of import statements and export declarations. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and shows no signs of malicious intent.",
