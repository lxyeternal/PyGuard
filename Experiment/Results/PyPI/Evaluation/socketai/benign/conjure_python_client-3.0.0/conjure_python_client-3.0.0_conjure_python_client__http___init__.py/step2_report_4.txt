  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard module that imports classes and functions from local modules (.configuration and .requests_client) and then exposes them via the `__all__` list.\n- It contains only licensing comments, import statements, and an export list.\n- There are no runtime operations, data processing, network communication, or dynamic behavior.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger package, serving as an interface or API surface.\n\n**Security implications:**\n- The code itself does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or write to files.\n- It does not contain any embedded or embedded malware, nor does it perform any obfuscation.\n- The licensing comments are standard boilerplate and do not pose security concerns.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of this code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, non-obfuscated code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable because the code does not introduce any security risk.\n\n**Potential issues or errors:**\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- The reports are thorough and consistent in their assessment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code fragment is a standard, safe module setup.",
