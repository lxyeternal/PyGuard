{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports classes and error handling related to configuration and HTTP requests for a larger application or library, likely involving secure connections and services.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes from local modules (.configuration and .requests_client). It does not read external or untrusted input directly.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks that process untrusted data, such as network connections, database queries, or file writes.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows from sources to sinks within this snippet. The imports suggest that data could flow into or out of these classes elsewhere, but not in this code fragment itself.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present. The code appears to be standard module setup and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes and functions from local files and then specifies what should be publicly available via __all__. It is primarily used for organizing and exporting components. There are no inputs, no data processing, no dynamic execution, or obfuscated code. The licensing comments are standard boilerplate, and the imports are typical for a Python package. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely imports and exposes components for use in a larger system. The overall security risk is minimal, and there is no evidence of obfuscation or malware.",
