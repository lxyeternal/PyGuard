  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment: `__version__ = \"3.0.0\"`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, functions, or external interactions.\n   - No obfuscation, no complex logic, no hidden or suspicious code.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Security Risks**:\n   - All reports assign a version string with no evidence of malicious intent.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation detected.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - The scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are all 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n   - The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Misinterpretations**:\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent; no contradictions or assumptions are evident.\n   - Since the code is minimal and standard, there's no reason to adjust scores or conclusions.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct; no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct; code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct; no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional Comments**:\n- The code snippet is a standard version declaration, common in Python packages.\n- No further analysis is needed; the code is benign.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The scores reflect the benign nature of this minimal version assignment. No changes are necessary.",
