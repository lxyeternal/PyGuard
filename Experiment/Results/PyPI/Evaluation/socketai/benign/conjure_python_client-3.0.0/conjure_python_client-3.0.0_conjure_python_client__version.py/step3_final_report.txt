  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, indicating the software version.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data flows or external outputs.",
  "flows": "None; no data flows from sources to sinks as there are no inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward assignment with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment statement setting __version__ to '3.0.0'. It contains no inputs, outputs, functions, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all 0, and confidence is 1, reflecting high certainty in the benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code is standard for version declaration in Python packages and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
