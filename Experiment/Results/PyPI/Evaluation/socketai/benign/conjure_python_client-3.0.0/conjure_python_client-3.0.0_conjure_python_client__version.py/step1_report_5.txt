  "sources": "None (no input or data reading occurs in this snippet).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data output or external effects are present).",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists as there are no operations beyond assigning a version string.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only a version string; no suspicious or unusual code elements. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to a variable, a common practice for Python packages. There are no external data inputs, no malicious functions, and no suspicious behavior observed. The code does not perform any operations that could lead to data leakage, system compromise, or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign assignment of a version string with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
