  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a string to the `__version__` variable. There are no inputs, outputs, functions, or control flows. This is standard in Python package version declarations and inherently benign.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation**:  \nAll reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. No hidden data, no code injection, and no external effects are present.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in the Reports**:  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code's purpose and lack of complexity. No logical errors or misleading conclusions are evident.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n- **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, as there's no obfuscation.  \n- **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, as the code is benign.  \n- **Security Risk Score (0)**: Correct, given the simplicity and lack of any security implications.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**:  \nNo assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis is appropriate. Since the code is only a version string, there's no basis for higher risk or malware scores.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency**:  \nThe scores are consistent with the code and reports. No discrepancies or unreasonable assessments are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct, code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct, no security risks)\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n\nGiven the extremely minimal nature of this code, even considering potential indirect implications, the scores should remain at zero across all categories. The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**In conclusion, I agree with the current scores.**",
