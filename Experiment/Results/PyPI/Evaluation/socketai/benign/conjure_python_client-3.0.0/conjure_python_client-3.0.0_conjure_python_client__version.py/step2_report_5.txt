  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only assigns a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, functions, or data processing.\n   - The code is a standard practice for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation:**\n   - All reports agree that there is no obfuscation, no suspicious code, and no malicious activity.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for package versioning.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - The reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n\n4. **Logical Flaws or Errors in Reports:**\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent.\n   - They correctly identify that this code is benign and standard.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n5. **Potential for Misclassification:**\n   - Given the simplicity and standard nature of the code, there is no basis for assigning any higher risk or malware scores.\n   - The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The code does not include any hidden or obfuscated elements.\n   - No external dependencies or dynamic behaviors are involved.\n   - No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and appropriate. The code is a benign, standard version assignment statement with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- The code is straightforward and safe.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Note:** Always keep in mind that minimal code snippets like this are unlikely to harbor malicious intent unless combined with other malicious code elsewhere.",
