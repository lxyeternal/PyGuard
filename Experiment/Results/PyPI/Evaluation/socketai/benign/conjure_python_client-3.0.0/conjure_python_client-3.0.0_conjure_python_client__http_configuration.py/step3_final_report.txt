{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration data structures for SSL and service parameters, used for setting up secure connections.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code only defines data classes and optional parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, output, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only declares data structures without runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Python dataclass definitions for SSL and service configuration, with optional fields like 'api_token'. It contains no data input/output, network calls, or dynamic execution. The structure is standard and benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The optional 'api_token' is a common placeholder in configuration files and does not indicate malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward configuration schema with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The assigned scores accurately reflect its safe and non-malicious nature.",
