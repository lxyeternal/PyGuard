  "purpose": "Define configuration data structures for SSL and service settings, including API tokens and connection parameters.",
  "sources": "None; code only declares data classes with default values, no input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no processing or output operations, no handling of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "None; data classes are used for configuration storage, with no flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present; no suspicious or unusual code patterns. Usage of optional fields and default values appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for SSL and service configurations with parameters such as API tokens, timeout settings, and URIs. There is no handling of input data, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The API token is optional and not hardcoded, and the rest are configuration parameters. Overall, this code appears to be standard boilerplate for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration data structure with no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security concerns identified. It serves to store configuration parameters safely.",
