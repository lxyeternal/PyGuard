  "purpose": "Define configuration data structures for a service, including SSL and connection settings.",
  "sources": "No input sources are present in this code; it only defines data classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present as the code only declares data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The optional api_token could be a credential placeholder, but its presence alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data class definitions for SSL and service configuration parameters, including optional and default values. It does not perform any input/output, network operations, or data processing. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity is evident. The code appears to be standard configuration setup, with no obfuscation, no code injection, and no evidence of malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration data structure definition with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is standard boilerplate code for service configuration.",
