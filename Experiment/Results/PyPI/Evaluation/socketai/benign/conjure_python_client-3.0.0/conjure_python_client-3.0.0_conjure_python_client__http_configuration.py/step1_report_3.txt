{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration data structures for a service, including SSL settings and service parameters.",
  "sources": "None; the code only declares data classes and does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations that process untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks since no input processing or data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; the code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data class definitions for SSL and service configurations. It does not perform any input/output operations, network calls, or data processing that could be malicious. No hardcoded secrets or sensitive information are evident, and no dynamic or obfuscated code is present. The use of optional fields and default values is standard. Overall, the code appears benign and intended solely for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple configuration data structure definition with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
