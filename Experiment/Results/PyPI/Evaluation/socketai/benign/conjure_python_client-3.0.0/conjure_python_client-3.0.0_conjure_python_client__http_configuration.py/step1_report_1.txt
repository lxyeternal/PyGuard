{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for service configuration, including SSL and connection parameters.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains class definitions and no data input or external data reading.",
  "targets": "None; there are no untrusted data sinks or output points.",
  "flows": "No data flows; code only defines data classes without processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Python dataclass definitions to encapsulate SSL configuration and service connection parameters. It does not include any data input, external communication, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration schema intended for use in larger applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration data structure with no malicious intent or security concerns identified.",
