  "purpose": "Convert CamelCase or PascalCase strings into snake_case format using regex substitutions.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'name' provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "The regex substitution operations that modify the input string.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex substitutions -> return snake_case string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses simple regex patterns with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility function performing string transformation from CamelCase/PascalCase to snake_case. It employs two regex substitutions to insert underscores at appropriate positions, then converts the string to lowercase. The code does not access external data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The regex patterns are simple and unlikely to be exploited. All five reports agree on the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which is consistent with the code's functionality. There are no signs of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or malicious payloads. The regex patterns are standard and safe, and the code's purpose is purely string formatting, with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility function for string conversion with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
