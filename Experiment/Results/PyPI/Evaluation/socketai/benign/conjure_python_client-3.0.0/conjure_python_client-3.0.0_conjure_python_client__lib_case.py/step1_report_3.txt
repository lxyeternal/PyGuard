{
  "purpose": "Convert a given string from CamelCase or PascalCase to snake_case.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'name' is read from external calls to the function to_snake_case.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a transformed string; there are no sinks that process or output untrusted data directly outside the function.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' flows through regex substitutions to produce the snake_case string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns observed. Usage of regex for string manipulation is standard. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 're' module for regex operations. The function 'to_snake_case' applies two regex substitutions to transform CamelCase or PascalCase input strings into snake_case. The first substitution handles transitions from a lowercase or existing underscore to an uppercase letter that starts a new word. The second substitution handles remaining uppercase letters following a lowercase letter or digit, inserting underscores. The code is straightforward, with no external data sources, no use of environment variables, and no dynamic code execution. It performs standard string transformation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function to convert CamelCase to snake_case. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are present. The implementation is standard and secure.",
