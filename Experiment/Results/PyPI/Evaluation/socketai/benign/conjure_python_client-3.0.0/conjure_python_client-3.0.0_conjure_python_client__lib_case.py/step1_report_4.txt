  "sources": "Input parameter 'name' provided to 'to_snake_case' function",
  "sinks": "Regex substitution operations within the 're.sub' calls",
  "flows": "Input string 'name' flows into regex substitutions, resulting in transformed output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that transforms CamelCase to snake_case using regular expressions. It performs two regex substitutions to handle different cases of uppercase letters, then returns the lowercase result. The code is straightforward, with no data leaks, external calls, or suspicious logic. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is present. The licensing comments at the top are standard and do not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple string transformation for formatting purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation is clear and safe.",
