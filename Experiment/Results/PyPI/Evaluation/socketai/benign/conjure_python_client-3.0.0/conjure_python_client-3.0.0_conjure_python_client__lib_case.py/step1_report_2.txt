  "sources": "Input parameter 'name' of the function to_snake_case.",
  "sinks": "The re.sub functions that process the input string and produce output.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' -> re.sub operations -> output string in snake_case.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed. The code uses regex substitutions which are standard for string transformation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that transforms CamelCase to snake_case using regular expressions. It reads an input string 'name', applies two regex substitutions to insert underscores before capital letters following lowercase or digit characters, then converts the entire string to lowercase. The code appears to be straightforward string manipulation without any external data access, network calls, or data leaks. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected. The code does not perform any I/O operations apart from the string input parameter, and it does not handle or process sensitive data or credentials.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function for string formatting with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and standard in functionality.",
