{
  "purpose": "Convert a string from CamelCase to snake_case.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'name' which is a string provided by the user or caller.",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs a transformed string; no other sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' is processed through regex substitutions to produce a snake_case string.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with standard regex patterns for string transformation; no anomalies or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 're' module for regex operations. It defines a function 'to_snake_case' that applies two regex substitutions to convert CamelCase strings into snake_case. The first substitution adds underscores before capitalized segments following lowercase or digit characters, and the second handles remaining capital letters. No user input is sanitized or validated, but the processing is purely string manipulation without external data access or execution. The code appears to serve a utility purpose without any malicious intent or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate utility for string conversion with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It processes input data in a safe manner, with no external dependencies or data leaks.",
