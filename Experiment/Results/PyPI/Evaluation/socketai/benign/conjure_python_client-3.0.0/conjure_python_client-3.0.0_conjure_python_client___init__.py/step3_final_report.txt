{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing internal modules and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from internal module imports (_serde, _http, _lib, _version).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code only imports modules and sets __all__.",
  "flows": "The flow is from module import statements to the __all__ declaration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py for a Python package, containing licensing comments, imports from internal modules, and defining __all__ for public API exposure. It does not process data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. All imported modules are internal, and no secrets or suspicious patterns are evident. The reports' assessments of malware score 0, obfuscation 0, and risk 0 are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
