{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an initializer or entry point for a Python package, importing modules and defining publicly accessible symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_serde, _http, _lib, _version) and the version variable __version__.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or user input handling, no network operations, and no sensitive data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: importing internal modules and defining the __all__ list for exports. There is no execution of untrusted input, no network connections, and no obfuscated or suspicious code. The licensing comments are standard open-source license declarations. The imports are relative and likely internal, with no external inputs or outputs involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation. It is unlikely to be malicious or security-sensitive.",
