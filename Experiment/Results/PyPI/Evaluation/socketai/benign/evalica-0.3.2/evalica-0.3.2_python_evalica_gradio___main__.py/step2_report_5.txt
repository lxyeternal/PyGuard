  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code functions as a web interface for ranking items based on pairwise comparison data.\n- They note that the code reads user-uploaded CSV/TSV files, validates data, applies ranking algorithms from the `evalica` library, and visualizes results with Plotly.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected.\n- The only minor anomaly is the dynamic import fallback for `gradio`, which is a standard pattern for optional dependencies and not malicious.\n- All reports assign very low malware and security risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.2), with high confidence that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears to perform data validation, mapping, and ranking as intended.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- **Data handling:** All data processing is local, with no external network communication or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code present.\n- **Secrets or credentials:** None detected or hardcoded.\n- **Suspicious patterns:** The fallback import logic for `gradio` is benign.\n\n### Logical flaws or errors:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries and patterns.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware:** Consistently 0 across reports, justified by the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, justified by clear, readable code.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (0.1-0.2), justified by the lack of external communication, secrets, or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- None of the reports justify a score > 0.5 for malware or security risk, and given the code analysis, this is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed reviews, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a benign, standard application for ranking via pairwise comparisons with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, primarily due to dependency handling, not actual vulnerabilities)\n\n**Overall:** The code is safe, trustworthy, and free of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign data processing and visualization tool with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
