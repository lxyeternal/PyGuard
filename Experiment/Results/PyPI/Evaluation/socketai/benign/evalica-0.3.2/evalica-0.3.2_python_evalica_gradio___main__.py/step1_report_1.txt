{
  "purpose": "This script provides a user interface for analyzing pairwise comparison data and generating rankings using various algorithms, visualized with Plotly and Gradio.",
  "sources": "Data is read from uploaded CSV or TSV files via gr.File input, specifically reading columns 'left', 'right', and 'winner'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly send untrusted data over the network or write to system files; it processes data internally and displays results visually. No sensitive data is stored or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input file data flows from pd.read_csv to data validation, then to ranking algorithm invocation, and finally to visualization. No external untrusted sink is identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The import fallback mechanism for 'gradio' is standard for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script carefully reads and validates input data, ensuring necessary columns and values are present. It maps string winners to enum values and computes rankings using selected algorithms, visualizing results with Plotly. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code relies on external libraries in a safe manner and performs typical data processing and visualization tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard application for ranking based on pairwise comparisons with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is benign, and no security threats are evident from the provided implementation.",
