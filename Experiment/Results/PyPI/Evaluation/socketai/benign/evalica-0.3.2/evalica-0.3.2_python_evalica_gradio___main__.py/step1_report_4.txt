{
  "purpose": "The script provides a web interface for ranking items based on pairwise comparison data using various algorithms.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV/TSV files uploaded by users, which contain columns 'left', 'right', and 'winner'.",
  "sinks": "Processes user-uploaded files, performs computations, and generates plots; no external data sinks or network communications are evident.",
  "flows": "Input file data -> Data validation and parsing -> Algorithm invocation -> Computation of scores -> Visualization generation.",
  "anomalies": "None observed. The code performs standard data validation, does not include obfuscated code, and there are no signs of hardcoded secrets or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries, handles file uploads, validates CSV columns and winner values, performs ranking calculations using multiple algorithms, and generates visualizations. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or suspicious behaviors are present. The conditional import of 'gradio' with fallback for missing modules is standard. Data is processed locally, and no hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate application for ranking items via pairwise comparisons, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions as a data processing and visualization tool with standard practices. No signs of malware or malicious behaviors are present.",
