  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All five reports consistently describe the script as a web interface built with Gradio, which reads user-uploaded CSV/TSV files containing 'left', 'right', and 'winner' columns, validates data, applies ranking algorithms from the `evalica` library, and visualizes results with Plotly.\n\n- None of the reports detect suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors.\n\n- The only notable behavior is the dynamic import fallback for `gradio` when the module isn't found, which is a common pattern for optional dependencies and not malicious.\n\n- The code does not perform network communication, data exfiltration, or write to system files beyond processing user input locally.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present in the code:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears standard and functional, with proper validation, error handling, and usage of external libraries. No malicious or harmful code constructs are evident.\n\n- **Security concerns:** No signs of vulnerabilities such as code injection, remote code execution, or secret leaks.\n\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. No overreach or unwarranted assumptions are apparent.\n\n- The reports correctly interpret the dynamic import fallback as benign.\n\n### Scores assigned by reports:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, which is accurate.\n\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal concern due to the dynamic import fallback, but overall low.\n\n- **Confidence levels:** Mostly high (0.9 to 1), appropriate given the thorough reasoning.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate given the benign analysis.\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The dynamic import fallback, while slightly unusual, is a common pattern and not malicious.\n\n- The code relies on external libraries (`evalica`, `plotly`, `pandas`, `gradio`) which are standard for such applications. Assuming these are trusted, no malicious activity is implied.\n\n- No signs of obfuscation, secret leaks, or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — minimal risk, mainly due to dependency handling, but overall very safe.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign web interface for ranking analysis. No security threats, malware, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0.1** |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the evidence provided.",
