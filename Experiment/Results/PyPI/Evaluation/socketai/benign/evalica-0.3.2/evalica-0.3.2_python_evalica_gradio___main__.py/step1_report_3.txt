{
  "purpose": "The code provides a web interface for ranking items based on pairwise comparison data using various algorithms.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV or TSV file uploaded by the user containing 'left', 'right', and 'winner' columns.",
  "sinks": "Uses pandas to process data, creates visualizations with plotly, and does not appear to output untrusted data directly to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "User uploads file -> Data is read into pandas DataFrame -> Data is validated and processed -> Rankings are computed -> Visualization is generated and displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The import fallback for 'gradio' via sys.path manipulation is notable but benign. No obfuscated code present. No malicious code or secret leaks identified.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard web app using Gradio for interface, pandas for data handling, and plotly for visualization. It validates input columns and values, then computes rankings via specified algorithms from 'evalica'. No external network connections or data exfiltration observed. The fallback import handling for 'gradio' could be considered unusual but is not malicious. No signs of malware or malicious intent were found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign application for ranking items based on user-provided comparison data. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are evident. It strictly handles data processing and visualization without external communication or hidden functionalities.",
