{
  "purpose": "The code provides a web interface for processing pairwise comparison data, applying ranking algorithms, and visualizing results using Gradio and Plotly.",
  "sources": "File upload input (`gr.File`), reading CSV/TSV files (`pd.read_csv`), user selections from dropdown (`gr.Dropdown`) and checkbox (`gr.Checkbox`), internal algorithm functions, and input columns ('left', 'right', 'winner') from the uploaded data.",
  "sinks": "Data passed to ranking algorithms (`invoke()`), visualization function (`visualize()`), and output dataframes (`gr.Dataframe`) and plots (`gr.Plot`).",
  "flows": "Input file -> DataFrame parsing -> validation -> mapping 'winner' to enum -> passing columns to `invoke()` -> algorithm computes scores -> results structured into DataFrame -> optional truncation -> visualization -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The only non-standard handling involves dynamically adjusting `sys.path` for `pydub`, which appears to be for module loading convenience and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily functions as a user interface wrapper around existing ranking algorithms in the `evalica` library, processing user-uploaded data and visualizing results. It performs input validation, error handling, and integrates with third-party libraries like Gradio, pandas, Plotly. No evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The dynamic import logic for `pydub` is a benign attempt to resolve dependencies. The code does not communicate externally, access sensitive environment variables, or perform any harmful actions. All operations are confined to data processing and visualization, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious interface for ranking data analysis using established libraries. There are no signs of malware, malicious code, or security risks. The script appears well-structured, with standard practices, and contains no suspicious behaviors.",
