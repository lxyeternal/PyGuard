{
  "purpose": "Provides a web interface for uploading pairwise comparison data, validating, ranking, and visualizing results.",
  "sources": "Reads uploaded CSV/TSV files, accesses external libraries (`evalica`, `pandas`, `plotly`, `gradio`), and processes user input locally.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows to external systems; data is processed locally without network transmission or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "User uploads data -> validation -> mapping winners -> invoke ranking algorithm -> generate visualization -> display results.",
  "anomalies": "The dynamic import fallback for 'gradio' involves manipulating `sys.path`, which is a common pattern for optional dependencies and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured web interface that handles data validation, applies established ranking algorithms, and visualizes results. It does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or network activity. The fallback import pattern for 'gradio' is benign. External dependencies are trusted libraries. No suspicious behaviors or malicious code segments are present. The security and malware scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with minimal risk due to dependency handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard application for ranking items based on pairwise comparisons. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
