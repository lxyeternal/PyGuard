{
  "purpose": "The code provides a web interface for analyzing pairwise comparison data and ranking items using various algorithms, including visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads input CSV/TSV files uploaded by users containing columns 'left', 'right', and 'winner'.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed internally; no direct data sinks for untrusted data are evident. The code performs data transformations and visualizations but does not write to external systems or perform network operations with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "User uploads file -> file read and validated -> data processed and rankings computed -> visualization generated for output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code imports modules dynamically if missing but does not execute code from external sources or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles user-uploaded data files, validates columns and values, and performs data analysis with established libraries. The dynamic import fallback for 'gradio' appears to be a standard pattern to ensure module availability, not malicious. The code does not contain any network activity, code injection, or credential handling. It uses standard data processing and visualization libraries. The algorithms used are imported from the 'evalica' package; assuming 'evalica' is a trusted external library, no malicious activity is evident. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. The code handles user input carefully with validation steps, reducing risk of injection or code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard implementation of a data visualization web interface for ranking algorithms, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It relies on external libraries that are presumed to be safe, and it processes user data without executing or transmitting it maliciously.",
