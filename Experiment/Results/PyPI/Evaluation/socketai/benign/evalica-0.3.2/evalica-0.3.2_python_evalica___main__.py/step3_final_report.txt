  "purpose": "A command-line utility that reads a CSV file containing paired data and a winner label, applies an evaluation algorithm from the 'evalica' package to compute scores, and outputs a ranked CSV with scores and ranks.",
  "sources": "Reading input CSV file via pandas.read_csv; reading 'winner' column; input data provided by user via command-line argument.",
  "sinks": "Outputting ranked scores and ranks to CSV file or stdout; no untrusted data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input CSV data -> pandas parsing and processing -> evaluation algorithm from 'evalica' -> scoring -> output CSV with scores and ranks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected. The code uses standard libraries and a reputable external package.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward data processing: reading CSV input, mapping 'winner' labels to enum values, applying evaluation algorithms, and outputting sorted scores with ranks. No malicious behaviors, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The external 'evalica' package is assumed benign; no code injection, unsafe SQL, or environment manipulation is observed. The code structure is clear, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies. The security scores assigned in the reports (mostly 0 or very close to 0) are consistent with the benign analysis. The minor risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) reflect reliance on external libraries but do not indicate actual vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured data evaluation utility with no malicious or suspicious behaviors. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) accurately reflects minimal external dependency reliance without evidence of vulnerabilities. Overall, the script is safe for use in production environments assuming the 'evalica' package is trustworthy.",
