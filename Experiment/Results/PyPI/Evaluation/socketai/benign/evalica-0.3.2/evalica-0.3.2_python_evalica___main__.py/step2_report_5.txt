  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Reads CSV, applies evaluation algorithms, outputs ranked scores. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Code & Dependencies:** Uses pandas and evalica, both standard. No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Scores malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign, with no malicious behavior or security concerns.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed. The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to others, reads CSV, applies algorithms, outputs scores. No anomalies.\n- **Dependencies & Behavior:** Uses pandas and evalica, standard libraries. No suspicious code.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Justification for securityRisk:** Slightly above zero, but no actual security issues are present. The minimal risk might be due to reliance on external libraries, but this is typical.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Score adjustment:** Keep securityRisk at 0.1; acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Same pattern, standard processing, no anomalies.\n- **Dependencies:** Uses pandas and evalica, both legitimate.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies benign behavior.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Same as others, straightforward data processing.\n- **Dependencies:** Uses pandas and evalica, standard.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher security risk score, but no actual malicious activity detected.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the code is safe.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Same pattern, no anomalies.\n- **Dependencies:** Uses pandas and evalica, standard.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code contains no suspicious or malicious code, dynamic execution, or network activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports agree on 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1 or 0.2), but these are minimal and justified by reliance on external libraries, not actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### **My final assessment:**\n\n| Metric            | Score |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| **Malware**      | **0**  |\n| **Obfuscated**   | **0**  |\n| **Risk**         | **0.1** (to reflect minimal external dependency reliance) |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured data processing utility with no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The minor security risk score reflects the dependency on external libraries, which is common and not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores, emphasizing that the code is safe and free from malware or obfuscation concerns.",
