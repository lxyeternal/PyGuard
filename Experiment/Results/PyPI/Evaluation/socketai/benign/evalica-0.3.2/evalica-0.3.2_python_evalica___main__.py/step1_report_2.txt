{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to read CSV input data, process it using specified algorithms, and produce an output CSV with scores and rankings.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from a CSV file specified via command-line argument (--input).",
  "sinks": "The code writes output data to a CSV file specified via command-line argument (--output).",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input CSV through the read_csv function into the invoke function, which applies an algorithm and returns scores, then flows into write_csv for output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution are present. The algorithms are imported from the evalica package, which appears legitimate based on available info.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly handles CSV file input/output, using pandas and a third-party package evalica for computations. It includes command-line argument parsing with standard FileType handling, and it invokes algorithms without executing untrusted code or system commands. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code does not contain suspicious network activity, system modifications, or malicious behavior. It is a straightforward data processing pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data processing tool for ranking inputs using various algorithms. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It relies on a third-party library evalica, which is assumed to be benign. Overall, the code is safe with no security concerns identified.",
