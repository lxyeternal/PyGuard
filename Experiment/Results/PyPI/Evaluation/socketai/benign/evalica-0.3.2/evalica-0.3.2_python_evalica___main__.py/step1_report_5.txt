{
  "purpose": "The script reads input data from a CSV file, processes it using various evaluation algorithms from the evalica library, and outputs the results to a CSV file.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from a CSV file specified by the user via command line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Output data is written to a CSV file specified by the user, potentially to stdout.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the CSV input file through pandas processing, into evaluation algorithms, then outputs the results to a CSV file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected; standard use of pandas and argparse, no hardcoded credentials, and no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard command-line processing, reads CSV data with pandas, applies multiple evaluation functions from the evalica library, and outputs sorted scores with rankings. All modules are standard, and no malicious or suspicious activities such as network calls, file manipulations beyond reading/writing, or dynamic code execution are present. The only external dependency, 'evalica', appears to be an open-source library for evaluation algorithms, with no suspicious behavior evident. The code correctly handles input/output and uses safe practices. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malware are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data processing script for evaluation purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for a typical CLI utility with open-source dependencies. Overall security risk is very low.",
