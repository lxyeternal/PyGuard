The scores are consistent with its benign nature, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minimal security risk score reflecting dependency URLs. It is safe to use in its current form."

The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the potential sensitivity of device features accessible via proxies, but the code itself does not perform any malicious operations."
