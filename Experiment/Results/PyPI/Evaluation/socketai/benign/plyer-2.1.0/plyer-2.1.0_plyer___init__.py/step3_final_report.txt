  "purpose": "Setup proxies for various device features using the plyer library, enabling access to hardware and system functionalities.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; the code initializes proxies for device features.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only proxy definitions without data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script that creates proxies for device features via the plyer library. It does not handle input, process data, or perform network operations. The code is static, well-structured, and uses standard patterns. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The proxies merely interface with device hardware without executing any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a device feature access layer. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the potential sensitivity of device features accessible via proxies, but the code itself does not perform any malicious operations.",
