  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for retrieving the device hostname on MacOSX. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores of zero for malware and obfuscation, and a very low security risk, are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
