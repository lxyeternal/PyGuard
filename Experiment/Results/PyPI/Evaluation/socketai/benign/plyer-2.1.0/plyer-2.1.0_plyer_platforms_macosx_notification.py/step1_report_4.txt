{
  "purpose": "Provides a MacOS notification implementation using plyer and pyobjus libraries.",
  "sources": "Imports from plyer.facades, pyobjus, and pyobjus.dylib_manager; uses input parameters in _notify method.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or perform dangerous operations. Notification delivery is a benign system API call.",
  "flows": "Input data (title, message, app_name) flows into notification object creation and is used to display system notifications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Uses standard macOS notification APIs. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code creates and delivers system notifications on MacOS using pyobjus to interface with native APIs. It properly initializes and configures notification objects, sets delegate for handling presentation, and delivers notifications through the system API. No external data exfiltration, network communication, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard APIs without any suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for displaying notifications on MacOS. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It is safe based on provided code, with no indications of malware or security threats.",
