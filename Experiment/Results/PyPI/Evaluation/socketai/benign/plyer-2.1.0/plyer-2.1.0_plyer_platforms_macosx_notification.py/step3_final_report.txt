  "purpose": "Implement macOS notifications using native APIs via pyobjus, delivering notifications with specified title, message, and app name.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'title', 'message', 'app_name' from kwargs.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to setTitle_, setSubtitle_, setInformativeText_, and deliverNotification_ on NSUserNotification and NSUserNotificationCenter objects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> notification object setters -> deliverNotification_ method.",
  "anomalies": "Delegate method 'userNotificationCenter_shouldPresentNotification_' always returns True, which is standard but could be misused to always display notifications; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads macOS frameworks, creates a notification object, sets its title, subtitle, and informative text from input parameters, and delivers it via the notification center. The delegate method ensures notifications are always presented. No external data flows, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward, uses system APIs correctly, and contains no obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of macOS notifications with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The delegate always returning True is typical behavior and does not introduce security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified and accurate.",
