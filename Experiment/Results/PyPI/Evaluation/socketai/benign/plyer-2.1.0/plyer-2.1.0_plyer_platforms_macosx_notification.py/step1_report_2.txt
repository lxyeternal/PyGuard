{
  "purpose": "Implement MacOS notification functionality using the plyer framework and pyobjus to interact with native MacOS APIs.",
  "sources": "Imports from plyer.facades, pyobjus, and pyobjus.dylib_manager; method calls to load_framework, autoclass, and notification setup.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with macOS notification system; no direct data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code creates a notification object, sets its properties, and delivers it via the notification center without involving untrusted input data that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs are detected. The code primarily interfaces with system APIs for notifications.",
  "analysis": "The script loads macOS frameworks, defines a notification class that creates and delivers notifications via system API calls. It uses standard APIs and conventions, with no signs of data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or backdoors. No external inputs are processed insecurely, and the code does not perform any network activity or file modifications. The code appears to serve as a simple notification interface, with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of macOS notification functionality using system APIs, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended for standard notification purposes.",
