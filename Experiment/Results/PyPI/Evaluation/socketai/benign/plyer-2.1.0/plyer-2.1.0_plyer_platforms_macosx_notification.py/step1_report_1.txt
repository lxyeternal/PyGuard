{
  "purpose": "Provides a MacOS notification implementation using the plyer library and pyobjus to interface with native APIs.",
  "sources": "Imports from plyer.facades, pyobjus, and pyobjus.dylib_manager; uses autoclass to load Objective-C classes; loads system frameworks; receives notification parameters via _notify method.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to deliverNotification_ and delegate setting, which handle notification display; no apparent sink leading to data exfiltration or system compromise.",
  "flows": "The _notify method constructs a native notification object from input parameters and delivers it via the NSUserNotificationCenter; no external data flows or untrusted input exploitation evident.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic Objective-C class loading and method invocations; delegates notifications to self; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs. No evidence of code obfuscation or hidden malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code interfaces with macOS native notification APIs via pyobjus, allowing displaying notifications with specified titles, messages, and app names. It sets itself as a delegate to handle presentation. No external data handling, network communication, or malicious behavior detected. The code performs expected API calls without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of macOS notifications using system APIs, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate notification purposes.",
