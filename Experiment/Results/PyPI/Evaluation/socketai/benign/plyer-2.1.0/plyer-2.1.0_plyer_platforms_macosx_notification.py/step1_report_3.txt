{
  "purpose": "This module provides a MacOS-specific implementation of notifications via the plyer API, utilizing pyobjus to interact with native MacOS APIs.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function arguments: 'title', 'message', and 'app_name'.",
  "sinks": "Calls native MacOS notification center methods to display notifications; no untrusted data directly affects system files or external resources.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> notification object properties -> delivery via NSUserNotificationCenter; no external data flow or network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and standard for native MacOS notifications. No obfuscated code, unusual constructs, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes and configures a native MacOS notification object, setting title, subtitle, and message based on provided arguments. It registers itself as a delegate and delivers notifications through the system API. There are no signs of malicious intent or data exfiltration. The use of pyobjus appears legitimate for MacOS API interaction. The delegate method always returns True for notification presentation, which is standard for such implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple MacOS notification wrapper with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It does not leak data or perform any harmful actions. The overall security risk is minimal.",
