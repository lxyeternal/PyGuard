  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of macOS notifications with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The delegate always returning True is typical behavior and does not introduce security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified and accurate."
