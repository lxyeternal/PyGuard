{
  "purpose": "Provides a MacOS notification implementation using the plyer.notification facade with pyobjus for Objective-C bridge.",
  "sources": "Imports from plyer.facades, pyobjus, and pyobjus.dylib_manager; loading MacOS frameworks; creating and delivering NSUserNotification objects.",
  "sinks": "delivering notifications via NSUserNotificationCenter, which could potentially be misused to display deceptive notifications or exfiltrate data if manipulated.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (title, message, app_name) are set into NSUserNotification objects and delivered via NSUserNotificationCenter, with delegate method always returning True to display notifications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code primarily interfaces with native MacOS notification APIs; no network activity or data exfiltration apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code loads necessary MacOS frameworks and creates a notification object, setting title, subtitle, and informative text from input parameters. It sets itself as delegate to always present notifications. No input validation or sanitization is performed, but given the context, this is typical. No suspicious API calls, network activity, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code simply acts as a wrapper for native notifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a MacOS notification utility without evident malicious intent. It does not contain backdoors, hidden data leaks, or malicious payloads. Its behavior appears benign and intended solely for displaying notifications.",
