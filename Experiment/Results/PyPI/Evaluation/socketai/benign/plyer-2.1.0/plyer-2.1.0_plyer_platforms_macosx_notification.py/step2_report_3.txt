  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of macOS notifications using native APIs via pyobjus. No malicious or suspicious code is evident.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes?**  \n  No logical errors or flaws are apparent. The delegate method always returns True, which is standard for presenting notifications.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — consistent with the analysis.  \n  - Security risk: 0 — reasonable given no external data flow or vulnerabilities.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is clear.\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Similar to Report 1, this code is a standard implementation of macOS notifications. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes?**  \n  No evident flaws. Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still reasonable.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security risk: 0.1 — minimal, possibly due to the delegate always returning True, which could be exploited to always present notifications, but this is standard behavior.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  No malicious behavior; the minimal security risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Again, standard macOS notification code. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — consistent.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — slightly higher, but still low; possibly due to the delegate always returning True, which could be exploited to always present notifications, but this is typical for such implementations.\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  No malicious intent, minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Same as above; no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes?**  \n  No.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security risk: 0.1 — consistent with benign notification code.\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  Safe, standard implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  The code is a typical macOS notification wrapper. No suspicious or malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes?**  \n  No.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — slightly higher, but justified given the delegate always presents notifications; however, this is standard and not inherently risky.\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  No signs of malicious activity or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior—no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, which is correct; code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1-0.2), justified by the code's benign nature and lack of external data flows or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to the delegate always returning True, which could be exploited to always show notifications, but this is a common pattern in notification implementations and not inherently dangerous.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is a standard, safe implementation of macOS notifications with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores are reasonable and justified based on the code analysis.",
