{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface to access the macOS accelerometer data via the plyer library and native osx_motion_sensor library.",
  "sources": "Calls to osx_motion_sensor.get_coord() during _enable() and _get_acceleration()",
  "sinks": "None; no data transmission, storage, or external communication present",
  "flows": "Source: get_coord() called in _enable() and _get_acceleration(); sink: data returned to caller",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward hardware access",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple wrapper around a native macOS sensor library, with standard exception handling. It does not perform network operations, data leaks, or obfuscation. All signals indicate benign behavior. External library trust is assumed but not verified; however, no malicious activity is evident from the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward implementation of a macOS accelerometer interface with no malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behavior detected. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
