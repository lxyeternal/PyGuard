  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The script is a standard setup.py for the 'plyer' package, reading version info from `plyer.__version__`, and documentation files. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate; no issues found.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard setup procedures with no malicious activity. Dependencies are specified via URLs for optional platform-specific modules.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical setup script with no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no obfuscation. Dependencies are standard, and the code reads static files.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard setup script, no suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Scores:** all zero — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports; standard package setup with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** all zero — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence:** The code is a typical, well-structured setup.py script for a Python package.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code patterns detected.\n- **Security risk:** None apparent; the script handles package configuration and dependencies in a standard manner.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThe reports are consistent with a benign, standard package setup script.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The dependency URLs are standard for optional platform-specific dependencies, and no suspicious logic is present.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure external URLs for dependencies are from trusted sources, but in this context, they are from reputable repositories.",
