  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'plyer' Python package, configuring installation requirements and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading package data, importing modules, reading README.md and CHANGELOG.md files.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data or external system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input reading from files (README.md and CHANGELOG.md) to variables, and configuration data to the setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. Usage of standard setup routines and dependency management.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package setup with standard Python practices: importing modules, defining package data, reading documentation files, and calling setup(). The 'try-except' block handles optional import of setuptools, which is common. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or sensitive data handling is present. All dependencies are from trusted sources, and there are no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It manages package configuration securely and transparently.",
