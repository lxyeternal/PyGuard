  "purpose": "Analysis of obfuscated code with dynamic execution indicating potential malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Code containing eval/exec, suspicious strings, network activity, and complex data flows.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamic code, network connections, and data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (eval/exec, network data) leading to code execution and data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, use of eval/exec, suspicious strings, network activity, complex data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution features, with suspicious strings and network activity, suggesting malicious intent. No benign patterns or safe practices are evident. The code's structure indicates potential covert operations, with source-to-sink flows involving dynamic code execution and possible data exfiltration. The high obfuscation and dynamic features justify elevated malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely malicious, primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic execution indicators. The overall security risk is high, warranting caution and further inspection. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware score set to 0.75, obfuscation at 0.75, and security risk at 0.7.",
