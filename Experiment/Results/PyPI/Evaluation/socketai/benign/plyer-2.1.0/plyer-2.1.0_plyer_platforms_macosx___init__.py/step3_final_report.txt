  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code structure, signals, and behaviors.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external system interactions, subprocess or socket modules (if present).",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file I/O, environment variables, system commands.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) potentially flow into system calls, network connections, or data storage points.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no malicious code snippets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is described as reading environment variables and user input, interacting with external systems, and not exhibiting obfuscation or malicious patterns. The confidence in benignity is high (0.8). No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications are indicated. The security risk score of 0.3 reflects cautious consideration of external interactions but remains low. The malware score is justified as zero, consistent with the benign description. The absence of code in some reports limits analysis, but the provided summaries support low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious indicators. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No evidence suggests obfuscation or malicious intent. Overall, the dependency is low risk, and the assessment aligns with the provided descriptions.",
