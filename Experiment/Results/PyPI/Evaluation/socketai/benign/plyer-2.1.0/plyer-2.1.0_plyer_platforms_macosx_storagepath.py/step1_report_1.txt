  "purpose": "Provides access to various storage and directory paths on MacOS X using native system APIs.",
  "sources": "Calls to NSFileManager methods such as homeDirectoryForCurrentUser and URLsForDirectory_inDomains_",
  "sinks": "Returns directory paths as strings, which could potentially be used elsewhere in the application.",
  "flows": "System API calls (sources) generate directory paths (sinks) for further use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code simply interfaces with system APIs to retrieve standard directories.",
  "analysis": "The code wraps native macOS APIs to retrieve various system directory paths such as home, documents, downloads, music, pictures, videos, and application directories. No data is transmitted externally or manipulated maliciously. There are no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling observed. The code appears to be a straightforward platform-specific implementation for directory retrieval. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate platform-specific implementation for accessing standard user directories on macOS. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
