{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for accessing various system storage directories on macOS using Objective-C bridge via pyobjus.",
  "sources": "Calls to NSFileManager methods such as homeDirectoryForCurrentUser and URLsForDirectory_inDomains_ to retrieve directory paths.",
  "sinks": "Returns directory paths as strings; no data sinks, network calls, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Source: Objective-C method calls retrieving directory URLs -> Return as strings; no flow to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard macOS Objective-C APIs via pyobjus to access system directory paths. No external inputs, user inputs, or untrusted data sources are processed. No network activity, no data exfiltration, and no malicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be a straightforward wrapper for system directories.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation for accessing system storage paths on macOS. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
