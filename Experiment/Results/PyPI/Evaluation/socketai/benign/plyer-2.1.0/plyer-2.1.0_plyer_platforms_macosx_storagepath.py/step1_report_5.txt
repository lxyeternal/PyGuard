  "purpose": "Provides an interface for retrieving storage directory paths on macOS using Objective-C bridges.",
  "sources": "Methods calling 'autoclass' to access NSFileManager and directory URLs, using 'homeDirectoryForCurrentUser' and 'URLsForDirectory_inDomains_'",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted input, no network or data leaks, no write or execute operations on untrusted data",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no untrusted data flows from sources to sinks. The code mainly retrieves directory paths.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed; the code accesses system directories via official APIs without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to access various storage directories on macOS through Objective-C runtime bridging. It retrieves system directory paths via 'NSFileManager' methods. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The code relies solely on system APIs to obtain directory paths, which is standard and expected. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or suspicious file manipulations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for retrieving storage paths on macOS without any malicious intent or security risks. It uses official system APIs and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
