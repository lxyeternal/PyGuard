{
  "purpose": "Provides platform-specific storage directory paths for MacOS X within a broader storage path abstraction.",
  "sources": "Uses system calls to NSFileManager and related APIs to retrieve directory URLs and paths.",
  "sinks": "Returns directory path strings; no direct data leaks or external communication; no user input handling present.",
  "flows": "System API calls retrieve directory URLs and convert them into string paths; no external data flows or user input flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code detected. Methods return platform-appropriate directory paths.",
  "analysis": "The code leverages macOS APIs to retrieve standard user and system directories. No user input, network operations, or external data sources are involved. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code functions as a straightforward interface to system storage paths.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation for retrieving system storage directories on macOS. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It adheres to platform standards and does not perform any harmful operations.",
