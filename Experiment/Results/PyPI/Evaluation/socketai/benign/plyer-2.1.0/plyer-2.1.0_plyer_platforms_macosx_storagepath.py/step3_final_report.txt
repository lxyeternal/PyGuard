  "purpose": "Retrieve standard directory paths on macOS using system APIs via pyobjus.",
  "sources": "System calls to NSFileManager and related directory enumeration constants.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or output data externally.",
  "flows": "Calls to 'homeDirectoryForCurrentUser' and 'URLsForDirectory_inDomains_' methods leading to string returns.",
  "anomalies": "Minor URL string formatting (e.g., 'file://' prefix) in '_get_home_dir' which may require sanitization but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around macOS APIs to retrieve directory paths, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. It does not handle user input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with its benign nature. The only minor consideration is the URL string format, which should be sanitized if used as filesystem paths downstream, but this does not constitute a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, correctly implemented, and poses no security threat. The scores and assessments in the reports are appropriate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
