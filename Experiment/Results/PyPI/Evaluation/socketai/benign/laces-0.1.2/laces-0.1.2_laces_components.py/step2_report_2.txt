  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines components and media containers for rendering in Django/Wagtail, using get_template and get_context_data.\n- **Sinks:** Template rendering via `template.render()` is standard; no untrusted data flow into system commands or network.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns. The dynamic `media` property is added via metaclass, which is a common pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is standard, safe, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, risk is 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues found. The reasoning is sound, and the score aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on UI components and media collection.\n- **Sinks:** Rendering templates and accessing media properties are safe; no direct untrusted data leading to vulnerabilities.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; usage of dynamic properties is typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is legitimate, safe, with a high confidence (0.95). Malware score is 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The reasoning is consistent; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** UI components and media handling, similar pattern.\n- **Sinks:** Template rendering and media property access are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code; standard Django/Wagtail practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The analysis is correct, and scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** UI components and media management, similar to previous reports.\n- **Sinks:** Rendering templates and media aggregation are typical.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code detected; usage of get_template and dynamic media property is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; reasoning and scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar pattern—rendering components and media in Django/Wagtail.\n- **Sinks:** Template rendering and media property access are safe.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; usage of dynamic media property is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, with maximum confidence (1). Malware score is 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The reasoning is solid, and scores align.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & My Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent with the code being standard Django/Wagtail rendering components with no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in template rendering and media handling, which is standard in such frameworks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — typical for template rendering systems, but no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe code is a standard implementation of Django/Wagtail UI components with media management. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements are present. The scores assigned in reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis indicates a safe supply chain component with no evident security concerns.",
