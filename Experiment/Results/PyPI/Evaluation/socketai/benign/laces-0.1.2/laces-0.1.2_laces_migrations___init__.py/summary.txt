  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are consistent with their analyses. The low malware scores reflect the absence of confirmed malicious payloads, while obfuscation and eval usage contribute to moderate suspicion. No significant adjustments are necessary; the overall risk remains low to moderate, emphasizing the need for further review if deployed in sensitive environments."
