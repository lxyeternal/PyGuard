  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval, dynamic code execution, obfuscated code segments, input reading points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, file writes, dynamic execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval or input feed into execution or data handling sinks, possibly via obfuscated code paths.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, use of eval/exec, complex or irregular code structure, lack of documentation or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which can be exploited if inputs are untrusted. No explicit malicious payloads or backdoors are identified. The use of eval and complex structures increases suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports align with these observations, with low malware scores (0.2) and moderate obfuscation (up to 0.7). The security risk scores are proportional to the suspicion level, primarily driven by eval usage and obfuscation. Overall, the code appears suspicious but not definitively malicious, warranting cautious review.",
  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are consistent with their analyses. The low malware scores reflect the absence of confirmed malicious payloads, while obfuscation and eval usage contribute to moderate suspicion. No significant adjustments are necessary; the overall risk remains low to moderate, emphasizing the need for further review if deployed in sensitive environments.",
