  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or manipulation, but without specific comments or documentation, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data might be read from environment variables, configuration files, or function parameters. No explicit input sources are visible without the code being provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, file writes, or database operations. Without the code, specific sinks cannot be identified.",
  "flows": "The flow would involve data originating from sources (like user input or environment variables) passing through processing functions and potentially reaching sinks such as network or file system, but no details are provided.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual behavior can be identified without the actual code content.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information is provided; the analysis cannot be performed without the actual code snippet. Typically, the analysis would include examining for source points, data flow paths, and potential malicious operations, but this is not possible here.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to determine malicious behavior or security risks due to lack of code content. No evident malicious or suspicious patterns can be assessed without seeing the actual code.",
