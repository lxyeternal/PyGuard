  "purpose": "Define protocols and type aliases for rendering HTML, rendering content, and media properties for use in a Django context.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; type annotations and imports are the primary sources of input data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leakage or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code defines interfaces without executing untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints, no runtime data processing, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines protocols and type aliases for static type checking in Python, specifically for Django components. No input processing, data flow, or untrusted data handling is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The code is standard for defining interface-like protocols using Python's typing and Protocol modules, with conditional imports for type hints. No suspicious or anomalous behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module contains only static type definitions and interface protocols for Django rendering components. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code.",
