  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of findings from reports:**\n\n- All reports consistently state that the code is solely defining static type protocols and aliases for Django components.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, no runtime code execution, no external data handling.\n- The use of `if TYPE_CHECKING` is standard for type hints and does not impact runtime behavior.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code serves purely as static type annotations for static analysis tools, aiding in development but not executing any logic at runtime.\n\n**Review of individual scores:**\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are also very low (mostly 0, with one at 0.1), reflecting the benign nature.\n- Confidence scores are high (1.0), indicating the reviewers are certain about their assessments.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n\n- The code is a standard pattern in Python projects using type hints, especially with Django, to define protocols for static type checking.\n- No vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The reasoning in all reports is consistent and justified.\n- The assigned scores seem appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Justification:**\n\nGiven the nature of the code—static type definitions for Django components—there's no basis for higher scores. The code does not perform any runtime operations, handle untrusted data, or include any suspicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the comprehensive analysis and the nature of the code.",
