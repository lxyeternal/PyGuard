  "purpose": "Define static type protocols and aliases for Django rendering components to facilitate static type checking.",
  "sources": "Conditional imports within 'if TYPE_CHECKING' for Django and typing modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; the code only declares types and protocols without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard static type definitions with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type aliases and Protocol classes for Django components, using standard practices like 'if TYPE_CHECKING' for conditional imports. No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. The code is clear, readable, and serves as static type hints, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores, mostly 0.1 at most, which is unjustified given the code's static nature. The confidence in these assessments is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as static type annotations for Django components. There are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, and security risk should be 0. The slight elevation to 0.1 in one report is unnecessary. Overall, the code poses no security threat and is standard for static type checking.",
