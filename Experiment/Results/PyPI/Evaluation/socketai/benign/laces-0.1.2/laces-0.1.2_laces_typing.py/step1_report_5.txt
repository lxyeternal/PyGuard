{
  "purpose": "Define protocols and type aliases for rendering HTML, rendering, and media properties, likely for use with Django templates or widgets.",
  "sources": "Type checking imports and property definitions, notably the 'media' property in HasMediaProperty.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines protocols and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING for type annotations, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines Protocol classes for static type checking, including 'HasRenderHtmlMethod', 'HasRenderMethod', and 'HasMediaProperty'. It employs standard practices such as conditional imports under TYPE_CHECKING to avoid runtime overhead. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. No untrusted data processing, network activity, or unsafe operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard type annotation and protocol definitions for a Django project, with no malicious or suspicious content. It appears to be a normal, benign part of a larger codebase.",
