  "purpose": "Define protocols and type aliases for rendering HTML, rendering, and media properties in a Django context.",
  "sources": "Type checking condition (TYPE_CHECKING), class method definitions, property definitions",
  "sinks": "None identified; no use of untrusted data, external inputs, or network operations",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from sources to sinks in the provided code",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING for type annotations, but no anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases and protocols intended for static type checking in Django projects. It uses conditional imports to avoid runtime overhead, which is standard practice. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external communication is present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors are detected. The code appears to be a standard type hinting setup for interface contracts in a Django environment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward type hinting and protocol definition module for Django components. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as an interface specification for rendering and media properties.",
