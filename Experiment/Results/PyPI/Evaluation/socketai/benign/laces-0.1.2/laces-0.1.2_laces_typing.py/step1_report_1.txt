  "purpose": "Define Protocols and Type Aliases for rendering and media handling in Django templates",
  "sources": "Type checking conditionally importing modules and defining type aliases, class method definitions",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or output occurs within this code",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this code primarily defines type protocols and aliases",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'if TYPE_CHECKING' is standard for type hints; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code detected",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type aliases and Protocol classes for static type checking in Django applications. It uses 'if TYPE_CHECKING' to avoid runtime import errors, which is standard practice. The Protocols define expected methods and properties for classes that handle rendering HTML and media, respectively. There are no dynamic code executions, external data inputs, or other risky behaviors present. The code serves purely as type hints for static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of type definitions for Django template components, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
