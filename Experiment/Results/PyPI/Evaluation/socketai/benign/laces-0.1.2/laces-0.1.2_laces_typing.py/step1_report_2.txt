  "purpose": "Define Protocol interfaces for rendering HTML, rendering, and media property access in a Django context.",
  "sources": "The code reads type annotations and imports from Django modules, primarily for type hinting and interface definition.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations that handle untrusted input or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code defines protocols and type aliases only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is standard for type hinting and interface declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code uses conditional imports for type checking, defines Protocol classes for rendering and media access interfaces, and creates type aliases for these protocols. All elements are typical for static type annotations in Django projects. No suspicious or malicious code behavior, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The code does not execute any untrusted data or perform runtime operations beyond type hinting.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard for defining interfaces and type aliases related to rendering in Django. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The code serves purely as a type annotation aid and does not perform any runtime actions or data handling that could pose security threats.",
