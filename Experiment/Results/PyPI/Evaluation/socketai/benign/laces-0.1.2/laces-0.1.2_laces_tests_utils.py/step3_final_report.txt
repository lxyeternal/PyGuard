  "purpose": "Utility class for comparing two Django Media objects in tests.",
  "sources": "Imports widgets from django.forms; uses repr() on Media instances.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input Media objects are compared via their repr() outputs; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward comparison using repr().",
  "analysis": "The code imports Media from django.forms.widgets and defines a static method that compares two Media instances by their repr() output. It is used solely for testing purposes, with no external data sources, sinks, or malicious patterns. The use of repr() is a common workaround when __eq__ is not implemented. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is simple, safe, and purpose-specific, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for testing Django Media objects, with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of repr() for comparison is safe in this context. All signals indicate no security concerns, and the scores are appropriately set to zero.",
