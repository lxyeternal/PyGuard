  "sources": "Imports from django.forms, specifically widgets.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any clear sinks that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are present; the code compares two Media instances via their repr outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a static method to compare two Media objects by their string representation, as Media lacks an __eq__ method. This is a standard testing utility without any suspicious behavior. There are no data flows from untrusted sources or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing utility that compares Media instances via their repr output. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
