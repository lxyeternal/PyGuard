  "purpose": "Utility functions for testing in the 'laces' package, specifically for comparing Django widget Media instances.",
  "sources": "The code imports `widgets` from `django.forms` and defines a static method for comparing Media objects.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Input: Media instances passed to `assertMediaEqual`. Output: Boolean comparison based on their `repr`.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The method uses `repr` for comparison, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple static method to compare two Media objects by their string representation. It does not process untrusted input in a way that could lead to injection or data leaks. The approach is straightforward and uses `repr`, which is safe here. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present. The import from Django is standard, and the method does not perform any external or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless utility for comparing Media instances in tests. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
