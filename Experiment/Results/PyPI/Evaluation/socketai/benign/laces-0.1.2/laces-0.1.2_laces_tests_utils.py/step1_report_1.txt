  "purpose": "Utility functions for testing within the `laces` package, specifically for comparing Django form Media objects.",
  "sources": "Import of `widgets` from `django.forms` and usage of `repr()` on Media objects.",
  "sinks": "Use of `repr()` on `Media` objects; no untrusted data sources or sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input Media objects -> comparison via `repr()` -> return boolean result.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; straightforward comparison function with no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple utility class with a static method to compare two `Media` objects by their string representations. It imports a Django module and uses standard Python features; no external or untrusted input processing, no code injection or malicious patterns detected. The use of `repr()` is safe here and appropriate for comparison in testing scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless utility for testing purposes with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
