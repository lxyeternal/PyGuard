{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of Django unit tests for components, focusing on rendering, context data, and media handling. It creates temporary template files, tests rendering outputs, and verifies media collection logic.",
  "sources": "File system operations (creating/deleting template files), class attributes, method returns, settings module, random filename generation.",
  "sinks": "Template rendering, file writes/deletes, media property access.",
  "flows": "Controlled, internal data flow during setup, rendering, and teardown; no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'random' for filename generation is benign; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard testing procedures for Django components, with safe file handling and predictable logic. No external input, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The use of temporary files and controlled filenames is typical in test environments. No obfuscation or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from file operations during testing, which are controlled and standard. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are justified and appropriate.",
