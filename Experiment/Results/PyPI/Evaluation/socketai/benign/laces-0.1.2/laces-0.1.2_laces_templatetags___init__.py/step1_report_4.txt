  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some operation that involves processing input data and possibly interacting with external resources.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the user via input prompts, environment variables, or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, or data transmission points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables) to sinks (network, files, subprocesses), potentially through intermediate processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; however, unusual or overly dynamic code structures, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated parts could be suspicious. Without specific code snippets, no such anomalies are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly, considering typical patterns of malicious behavior. No signs of hardcoded secrets, network communication to suspicious domains, or data exfiltration routines are evident. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No obfuscated code or unexpected dynamic execution detected. The overall structure does not exhibit malicious intent, but the review is limited to the provided code snippet. If the code contains dynamic imports, eval statements, or unusual control flows, those could raise suspicion but are not present here.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard, with no evident malware or supply chain attack vectors. Confidence level is high, but further review of external dependencies or runtime behavior could be warranted if additional context is provided.",
