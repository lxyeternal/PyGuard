{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom Django template tag 'component' that resolves a component object and renders it using its 'render_html' or 'render' method, with options for context isolation, fallback rendering, and variable assignment.",
  "sources": "Template arguments, including component object, fallback method, context options, and variable name; resolves component via 'resolve' method.",
  "sinks": "The 'html' variable after rendering, potential context modifications, and output returned as SafeString or stored in context.",
  "flows": "Component object resolved from template context → 'render_html' or 'render' method called → output assigned to 'html' → escaped if necessary → returned or stored in context variable.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Proper escaping used when 'autoescape' is active. No external network or file access observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Django template tag with argument parsing, context management, and safe rendering practices. It relies on external component objects' methods, which could be malicious if untrusted, but the code itself is safe. Argument validation and escaping are correctly handled. No signs of obfuscation or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, well-structured Django template tag implementation with no inherent malicious behavior or obfuscation. Risks are primarily external, depending on component object implementations. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a security risk score of 0.2 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
