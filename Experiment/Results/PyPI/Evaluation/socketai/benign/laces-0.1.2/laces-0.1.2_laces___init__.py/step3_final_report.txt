  "purpose": "Define a static version string for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The tuple VERSION as the source of version components.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input is processed.",
  "flows": "The tuple VERSION flows into the join operation to create __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version tuple and converts it into a string. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. It is a common pattern for versioning in Python packages. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code is static, clear, and free of obfuscation or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves a standard purpose, and poses no security risks or malicious intent. The scores of malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0.",
