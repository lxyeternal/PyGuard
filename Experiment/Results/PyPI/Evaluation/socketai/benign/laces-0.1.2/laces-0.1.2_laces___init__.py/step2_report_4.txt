  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code verification**:  \n   The code in all reports is straightforward:\n   ```python\n   VERSION = (0, 1, 2)\n   __version__ = \".\".join(map(str, VERSION))\n   ```\n   This is a standard pattern for defining a package version in Python. It involves no external input, no data leaks, no dynamic or obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a simple version assignment with no suspicious patterns or security issues. No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores review**:\n   - **Obfuscated score (0)**: Correct, the code is not obfuscated.\n   - **Malware score (0)**: Correct, there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Security risk score (0)**: Correct, no security concerns are present.\n\n   The scores are appropriate and align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely static, with no external inputs or suspicious behavior, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The reports correctly assign a score of 0 for malware and security risk.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations**:  \n   The code does not perform any malicious actions—no code injection, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior. The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code and analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a standard version declaration pattern with no security issues or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation**:  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe and typical for Python packages.",
