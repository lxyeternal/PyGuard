  "purpose": "Define the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "Constant tuple 'VERSION' and the join operation that constructs '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Mapping of VERSION tuple to string stored in __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version assignment with no unusual code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version tuple and converts it into a dot-separated string assigned to __version__. There are no inputs from external sources, no data manipulation beyond string joining, and no suspicious or malicious patterns detected. The code appears to serve a standard purpose of versioning within a package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is standard boilerplate for Python package versioning.",
