  "purpose": "Define the version number of the module as a string",
  "sources": "Assignment to VERSION tuple, conversion to string, and joining to form __version__",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "Assignment from tuple to string via join operation",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version tuple and creates a string representation for the module's version. There are no external inputs, no data processing beyond simple static assignment, and no suspicious or malicious code behavior. It is a standard way of defining version information in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely defines a version string; there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
