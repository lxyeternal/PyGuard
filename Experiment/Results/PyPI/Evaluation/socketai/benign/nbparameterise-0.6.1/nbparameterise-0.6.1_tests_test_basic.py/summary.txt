  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing script with a significant security concern due to the use of exec() on potentially untrusted notebook content. No malicious code is embedded, and obfuscation is absent. The malware score remains at 0, but the security risk is high if notebooks are untrusted. The risk score should be around 0.75 to 0.8, emphasizing caution in such scenarios."
