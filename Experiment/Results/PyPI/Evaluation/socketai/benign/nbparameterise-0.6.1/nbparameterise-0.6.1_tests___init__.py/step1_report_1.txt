  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python package possibly intended for general use or distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the user (via input functions), environment variables, and possibly external files or network connections if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network sockets, file write operations, subprocess calls, or API interactions that could leak data or execute malicious commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network transmissions or system commands, possibly through intermediate processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No obfuscated code, unusual variable naming, or suspicious dynamic execution observed. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined thoroughly. It uses standard Python modules and practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. No backdoors, system data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity detected. The code's behavior aligns with typical package functionality, and there are no hidden or suspicious code paths.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign Python package with standard features. The overall security risk score is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
