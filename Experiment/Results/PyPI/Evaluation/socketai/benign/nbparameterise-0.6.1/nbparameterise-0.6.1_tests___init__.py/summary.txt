  "conclusion": "Most reports' scores are consistent with their descriptions, with some room for slight increases in malware scores for reports exhibiting obfuscation and dynamic execution. The overall threat level remains moderate, emphasizing caution when handling obfuscated or dynamically executed code. Final scores should reflect the suspicion level but avoid overestimating malicious intent without concrete payloads."
