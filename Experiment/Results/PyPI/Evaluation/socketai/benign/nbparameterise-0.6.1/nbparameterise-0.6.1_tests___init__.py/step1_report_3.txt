{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module intended for data processing and utility functions, possibly within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are primarily from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external modules; no direct user input or file reading is explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks include network connections, file writes, or database operations; however, specific sink functions are not clearly identified in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters, environment variables) through processing functions and potentially to outputs such as logs, network calls, or files; detailed flows are unclear due to the lack of explicit I/O code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code uses standard Python constructs with no obfuscated logic or uncommon language features.",
  "analysis": "The code performs routine data processing with function definitions, environment variable reads, and standard library usage. There are no signs of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or code injections. The absence of suspicious network activity or hidden code segments suggests benign intent. Overall, the structure and content do not indicate malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be legitimate utility or processing code with no malicious behavior detected. It is considered low security risk, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent based on the provided fragment.",
