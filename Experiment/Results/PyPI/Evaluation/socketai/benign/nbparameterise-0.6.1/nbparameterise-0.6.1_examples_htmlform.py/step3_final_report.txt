  "purpose": "Generate an HTML form based on notebook parameters for web interface interaction.",
  "sources": "Parameter metadata (name, type, value), external CDN URLs for CSS and JS resources.",
  "sinks": "HTML output embedding input elements, form submission to '/submit'.",
  "flows": "Parameter data types determine input element creation; inputs are embedded into form; form submits data via POST.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns; straightforward HTML generation.",
  "analysis": "The code creates HTML form elements based on parameter types, using a custom 'htmlgen' library. It includes standard external resources from CDNs. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The logic is simple, with clear separation of concerns. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. External URLs are standard and trusted. The form's action is fixed at '/submit', typical for web forms. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external dependencies and static HTML generation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting the benign nature and external resource reliance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured HTML form generator with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis, indicating very low security risk. No modifications are necessary.",
