  "purpose": "Generate an HTML form based on notebook parameters for a web application.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to build_form() function; class attributes; external libraries used for HTML generation.",
  "sinks": "HTML output generated by htmlgen library; inclusion of external stylesheets and scripts; form submission action.",
  "flows": "Parameters -> make_input_element() -> input elements -> form -> HTML document; external resources loaded for styling and scripts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Usage of external libraries appears standard. No suspicious code paths or obfuscated code present. No data leakage mechanisms or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an HTML form dynamically based on provided parameters, utilizing the htmlgen library. It includes external resources for styling and scripting, which is typical for web forms. The form submission endpoint is fixed as '/submit', and input elements are created based on parameter types, with no user input handling or direct data processing implemented here. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors are evident. External resource inclusion is standard and necessary for styling and scripting, not suspicious. Overall, the code performs a benign function of form generation without any malicious or harmful logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for generating an HTML form based on parameters. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks present. It appears safe for use within its intended purpose.",
