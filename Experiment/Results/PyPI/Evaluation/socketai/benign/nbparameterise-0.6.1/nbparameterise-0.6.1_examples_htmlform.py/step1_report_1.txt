  "purpose": "Generate an HTML form based on notebook parameters for a web application interface.",
  "sources": "Parameters input, parameter metadata, and external URLs for stylesheets and scripts.",
  "sinks": "HTML element creation, setting attributes, and embedding external stylesheet/script URLs.",
  "flows": "Parameter metadata -> make_input_element -> build_form -> HTML document structure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. External URLs are standard CDN links, and no user input is directly used without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for HTML form elements, dynamically creates input fields based on parameter types, and constructs a complete HTML document with external resources. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling is present. The code primarily focuses on generating HTML markup and embedding external assets, which are common in web apps. There are no evident malicious behaviors such as network data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injections. External URLs are standard CDN links for bootstrap and jQuery, used for styling and scripts. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe data handling patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for generating HTML forms from notebook parameters. It does not contain malicious code, suspicious external calls, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe to use from a security perspective.",
