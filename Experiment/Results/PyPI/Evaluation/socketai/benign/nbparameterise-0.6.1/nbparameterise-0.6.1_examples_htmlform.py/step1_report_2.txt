  "purpose": "Generate an HTML form based on notebook parameters for web interface input.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to build_form function, parameters' metadata, static stylesheet and script URLs.",
  "sinks": "HTML element creation (input, form, div), adding stylesheets and scripts, setting attributes.",
  "flows": "Parameters -> make_input_element -> Input/Checkbox -> build_form -> HTML document.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of static external URLs is typical for UI resources. No evident malicious code or data exfiltration logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes to generate HTML form elements dynamically based on parameter metadata. The build_form function constructs an HTML document with embedded stylesheets and scripts from trusted CDNs. It creates input fields for parameters, with support for different types (string, int, float, bool), and adds a submit button. No user input is processed insecurely; all HTML and script injections are static and controlled. There are no suspicious behaviors like network communications, data leaks, or code execution beyond HTML generation. The code appears to be solely for UI rendering, with no malicious intent or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard HTML form generator with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses external resources for styling and scripting but does not perform any insecure operations or data exfiltration. Overall, it is safe and intended for UI purposes.",
