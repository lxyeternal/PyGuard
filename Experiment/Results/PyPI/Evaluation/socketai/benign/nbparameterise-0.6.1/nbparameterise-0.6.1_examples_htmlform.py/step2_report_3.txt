  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior**:\n   - All reports explicitly state that no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n   - External URLs are standard CDNs, and no unsafe data handling is observed.\n   - The code is primarily for generating HTML forms based on parameters.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - The code appears logically sound and consistent.\n   - No technical flaws or security flaws are evident from the description.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with their analysis.\n   - Security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1 to 0.2), consistent with benign behavior.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**:\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly states that the code is safe.\n   - The use of external resources is standard and not suspicious.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - Given the benign nature, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (reflecting minimal external dependencies and form generation)  \n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward HTML form generator, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The external URLs are standard CDN links, and the logic is clear and safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign and safe for deployment.  \n- Scores reflect the absence of malware, obfuscation, and significant security risks.  \n- The detailed analysis confirms the benign nature of the implementation.",
