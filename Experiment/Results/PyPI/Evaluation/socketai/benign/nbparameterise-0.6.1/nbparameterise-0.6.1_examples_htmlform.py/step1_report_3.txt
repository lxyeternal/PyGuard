{
  "purpose": "Generate an HTML form based on notebook parameters for use in a web application.",
  "sources": "Parameters input to build_form, attributes of each parameter (name, type, value, metadata), external data (possibly from user input or notebook metadata).",
  "sinks": "HTML element creation and attribute setting, script and stylesheet inclusion, form submission endpoint '/submit'.",
  "flows": "Parameter data flows into make_input_element() to generate input elements, which are then incorporated into the form elements for rendering. External scripts/stylesheets are loaded for UI. User input may be captured via form submission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution; no obfuscated code; no direct network connections or system modifications observed. Use of external scripts/stylesheets is standard but could be considered external dependency loading, not suspicious here.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for HTML input elements and a form builder that creates a web form based on provided parameters. It imports an external 'htmlgen' library for HTML generation, which appears to be well-structured and focused on safe HTML element creation. No indications of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, system modification, or backdoors, are present. The parameters are used only to generate HTML form inputs; there are no hidden fields, no code execution, and no unsafe data handling evident. External dependencies are standard for web UI, and script/stylesheet links are common CDN links or local files. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward form generator with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard HTML form generation utility for notebook parameters with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses external libraries solely for HTML generation, and no harmful actions are evident.",
