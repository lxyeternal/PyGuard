  "purpose": "Generate an HTML form based on notebook parameters for a web application.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to build_form(), metadata of each parameter (especially 'display_name'), and class attributes of parameters (type, name, value).",
  "sinks": "HTML generation functions that produce form elements, setting attributes like 'action', 'method', 'value', and appending scripts and stylesheets.",
  "flows": "Parameters and their metadata are used to create input elements, which are embedded into an HTML document with associated styles and scripts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors. No suspicious network activity, file operations, or obfuscated code. The code dynamically generates form elements based on input parameters, which is typical behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an HTML document for a form, utilizing input parameters and their metadata to generate input elements. The use of external scripts and stylesheets appears standard for web apps. The class design and function flow follow typical patterns for dynamic form generation. No indicators of malicious behavior, such as network exfiltration, command execution, or data leaks, are present. The code’s purpose and behavior are transparent and aligned with its described purpose. No suspicious anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward form generator for a web application, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It dynamically creates HTML forms based on provided parameters, using standard libraries and practices. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code is present.",
