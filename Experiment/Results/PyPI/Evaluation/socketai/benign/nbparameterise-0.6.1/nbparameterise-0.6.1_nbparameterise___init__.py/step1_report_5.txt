{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a larger module for handling notebook parameters, likely to facilitate re-running notebooks with substituted input parameters.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.code) that provides functions and classes related to parameter extraction and replacement.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks for untrusted data or outputs; the code does not perform any data output, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code imports functions but does not execute data flows or transformations within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are present in this fragment. The import statements and the version declaration are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports several functions/classes from a local module. The purpose seems to be to provide utilities for parameter extraction and replacement in notebooks. No data reading, user input, network communication, or file operations are present in this snippet. Since the code only defines metadata and imports, it does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a parameter management system for notebooks, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign part of a larger notebook utility module, with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It solely imports functions and defines a version, which is typical for module setup.",
