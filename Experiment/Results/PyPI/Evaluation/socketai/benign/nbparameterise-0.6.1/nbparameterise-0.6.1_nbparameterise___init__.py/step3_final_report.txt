{
  "purpose": "The code manages notebook parameters; it imports functions for parameter extraction, replacement, and retrieval, facilitating parameter management in notebooks.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or data; it only imports functions from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports functions and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module with a version string and import statements for parameter handling functions. It does not execute any data processing, network activity, or malicious operations. The import statements are static and do not pose security risks. The code's simplicity and lack of dynamic or external data handling indicate a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. The only potential concern is if the imported functions are malicious or misused elsewhere, but based solely on this snippet, no such behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for notebook parameter management with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is negligible, and the malware likelihood is zero. The reports' assessments are accurate; no adjustments are necessary.",
