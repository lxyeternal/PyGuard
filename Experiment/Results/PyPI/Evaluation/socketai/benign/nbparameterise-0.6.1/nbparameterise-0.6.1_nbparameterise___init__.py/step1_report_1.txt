{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a package that processes Jupyter notebooks by extracting, replacing, and managing parameters within notebook cells.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local module (.code) that likely processes notebook content and parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks in the provided snippet; however, functions like 'replace_definitions' and 'parameter_values' may manipulate notebook content or parameters, potentially influencing notebook execution.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions that likely read parameter definitions and values (sources) and modify notebook cells (sinks). The flow would involve extracting parameters, replacing definitions, and injecting values into notebooks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and only imports functions without executing or manipulating data directly.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is a minimal module import statement, referencing functions related to parameter extraction and replacement for notebooks. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious data handling. The code's purpose appears to facilitate parameter management within notebooks, with no apparent malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focused on notebook parameter handling, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It performs standard import operations without executing or manipulating sensitive data.",
