{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define version information and import functions related to parameter extraction and replacement in a notebook context, likely for manipulating notebook cells.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only imports functions from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only references internal functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The comment suggests notebook manipulation, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script imports functions from a local module and sets a version string. No data input handling, network communication, or system modifications are present. The purpose seems to facilitate parameter management within notebooks. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple module with versioning and function imports for notebook parameter management. No malicious intent or security issues are detected.",
