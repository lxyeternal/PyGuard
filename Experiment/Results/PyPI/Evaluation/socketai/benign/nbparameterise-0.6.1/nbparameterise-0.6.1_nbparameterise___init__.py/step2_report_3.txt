  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a minimal import statement with no execution or data manipulation. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. This seems appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no suspicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it’s an import statement with no active data processing. Slight mention of potential misuse if functions are misused elsewhere, but no direct evidence.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1. The risk score is very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Justification:** Given the snippet's simplicity, a risk score of 0.1 is acceptable, acknowledging that imported functions could be misused elsewhere, but the code itself is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—import statements with no active data flow or malicious behavior. The report notes potential processing of untrusted input if functions are misused, but the snippet itself is safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The risk is low, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely structural, with no evident security issues.\n\n**Verdict:** **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on benignity and lack of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.0. Perfectly aligned with the code's simplicity.\n- **Justification:** No issues are present.\n\n**Verdict:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above—just imports and version info, no active processing or malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.0. Correct.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign module import with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting the code's non-executable, utility nature.\n- The malware scores are correctly zero, given no malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.05 (a very conservative, minimal risk score to account for potential misuse in larger context, but the code itself is safe)\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are justified and reasonable based on the provided code snippet and reports. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always consider the broader context—if the imported functions are malicious or if the larger module performs harmful actions, the scores might need adjustment. But based solely on this snippet, the assessment is sound.",
