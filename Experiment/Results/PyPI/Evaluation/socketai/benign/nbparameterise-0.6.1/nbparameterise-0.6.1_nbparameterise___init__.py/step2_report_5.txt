  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code snippet provided, which is a minimal module import statement with a version string.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code is a straightforward import statement importing functions related to parameter extraction and replacement in notebooks, along with a version string.  \n- All reports correctly identify that the code only performs static imports and defines a version, with no execution or data manipulation.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning**\n\n- The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no malicious activity or suspicious behavior.  \n- They correctly note that, since the code only imports functions and sets a version, it does not perform any harmful operations.  \n- No errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports; they are consistent and accurate given the code snippet.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- All reports assign very low or zero scores for malware and security risk, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.  \n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforwardness of the code.  \n- No adjustments seem necessary based on the evidence.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since the code is purely an import statement with no execution, no data processing, and no network activity, a high risk score is unwarranted.  \n- The assigned scores of 0 or 0.1 for security risk are appropriate.  \n- Malware score is 0 across reports, correctly indicating no malicious behavior.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge claims based on assumptions**\n\n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent, focusing on the code's simplicity.  \n- They acknowledge that potential risks could depend on the imported functions' behavior, but since those are not shown, no suspicion is warranted here.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure score consistency**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.  \n- The high confidence scores are justified, given the minimal and benign code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — No evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — No security risk detected in this fragment.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The reports correctly interpret the code as benign and utility-focused.  \n- Since the code only imports functions and defines a version, the overall security posture is safe based on this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent with the code provided.  \n- No modifications to scores are necessary.  \n- The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the nature of the code snippet.",
