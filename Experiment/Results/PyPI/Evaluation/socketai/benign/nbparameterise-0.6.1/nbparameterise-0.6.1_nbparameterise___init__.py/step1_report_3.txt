{
  "purpose": "The code appears to facilitate parameter extraction and substitution in Jupyter notebooks, likely to re-run notebooks with modified input parameters.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from a relative module (.code) related to parameter handling, which may process user input or external parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are visible in the provided snippet; potential sink points could be within the imported functions if they handle untrusted input or perform dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Input data may flow from external parameters into functions like replace_definitions or parameter_values, which could then influence notebook execution or output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions for parameter extraction and replacement, suggesting a utility for notebook parameterization. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The simplicity and standard structure reduce suspicion. Since actual function implementations are not shown, potential risks depend on the behavior of imported functions, which are not provided here.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, serving as part of a notebook re-execution utility focused on parameter management. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risks based solely on this fragment.",
