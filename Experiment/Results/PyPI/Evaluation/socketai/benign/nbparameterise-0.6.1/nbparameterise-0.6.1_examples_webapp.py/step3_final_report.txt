{
  "purpose": "This code provides a web interface to parameterize, execute, and display the output of a Jupyter notebook, dynamically generating forms based on notebook parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads notebook file from command-line argument, extracts parameters, and user input via web form.",
  "sinks": "Executes user-modified notebooks, replacing parameters with user input, then runs the notebook and outputs HTML.",
  "flows": "Notebook file -> extract parameters -> build form -> user input -> replace parameters -> execute notebook -> convert to HTML -> display output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard libraries used; no network activity or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a notebook, extracts parameters, builds a web form, accepts user input, replaces parameters, executes the notebook, and displays HTML output. It relies on standard open-source libraries and does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The main security concern is executing arbitrary notebooks supplied by users, which could be malicious, but this is an inherent feature of such tools, not a flaw. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's logic is straightforward and transparent, with no anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent web app for parameterizing and executing notebooks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The primary risk stems from executing user-supplied notebooks, which could be malicious, but this is an expected feature rather than a flaw. The scores reflect this understanding.",
