  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or system interaction, but the specific intent cannot be fully determined from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, user input, or files (if present in the full code). Specific source points are not visible in the snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands. However, without explicit code, these cannot be definitively identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through various processing steps. Due to the lack of detailed code, no specific source-to-sink paths can be confirmed.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The review process indicates that the code does not contain overt malicious patterns such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft. It appears to be standard application logic. Absence of suspicious imports, obfuscated segments, or malicious API usage reduces concern. However, the analysis is limited by the absence of the full code and context.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems typical of benign Python scripts, but a comprehensive review of the complete code is recommended for certainty.",
