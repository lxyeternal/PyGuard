{
  "purpose": "The code runs a Jupyter Notebook ('Stock display.ipynb') multiple times with different stock parameters, executing the notebook and saving the output for each stock.",
  "sources": "Reads the notebook file 'Stock display.ipynb' from disk.",
  "sinks": "Executes the notebook content via nbclient.execute(), writes output notebooks to disk.",
  "flows": "Reads notebook -> modifies parameters -> executes notebook -> saves modified notebook.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns. Uses standard libraries and functions for parameter substitution and execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for notebook execution and parameter manipulation. It reads a notebook file, extracts parameters, then iterates over a list of stock names. For each stock, it updates parameters, executes the notebook, and saves the output. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. No suspicious code or malicious behavior detected. The flow is straightforward: parameter substitution followed by execution and saving results. The use of nbparameterise and nbclient is typical for notebook automation; no signs of malicious code or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs automated parameterized execution of a notebook without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign automation script for running and saving notebook outputs with different parameters.",
