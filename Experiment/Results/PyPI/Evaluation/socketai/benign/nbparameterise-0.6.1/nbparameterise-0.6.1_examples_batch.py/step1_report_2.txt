{
  "purpose": "The code loads a Jupyter notebook, extracts parameters, iterates over a list of stock names to substitute these parameters into the notebook, executes it, and saves the modified notebooks for each stock.",
  "sources": "Reads the notebook file 'Stock display.ipynb' from disk and reads input parameters from the notebook structure.",
  "sinks": "Writes modified notebooks to disk with filenames based on stock names.",
  "flows": "Reads notebook from disk -> extracts parameters -> substitutes parameters in the notebook -> executes the notebook -> writes output notebooks to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no network connections, no execution of suspicious commands, no obfuscated code, and no unusual or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a specific notebook file, extracts parameters, updates parameters in a loop for each stock, executes the notebook, and saves the results with distinct filenames. All actions are related to notebook parameterization and execution, which are standard in data processing workflows. No data leakage, no network activity, and no malicious code or backdoors are evident. The use of nbclient and nbparameterise is appropriate for notebook automation tasks. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard notebook parameterization and execution tasks without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a benign script for automating notebook runs with different inputs.",
