{
  "purpose": "The code reads and executes a Jupyter Notebook, replacing certain parameters with stock names and saving the modified notebooks.",
  "sources": "Reading the notebook file 'Stock display.ipynb' using nbformat.read; extracting parameters with extract_parameters.",
  "sinks": "Executing the notebook with nbclient.execute; writing modified notebooks to files with nbformat.write.",
  "flows": "Extracted parameters are modified with parameter_values, then used to replace definitions in the notebook with replace_definitions, which is then executed. The flow involves reading input, parameter substitution, execution, and output file writing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution beyond standard library functions, and no suspicious network activity or obfuscated code detected. Use of standard libraries and functions suggests typical notebook processing.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a notebook, extracts parameters, updates them in a loop for each stock name, executes the notebook, and saves each output. All operations use safe, standard libraries without any suspicious patterns. No input validation or network calls are present beyond executing the notebook, which appears to be a typical data processing task. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code components identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate automation script for processing Jupyter notebooks with different stock parameters. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
