{
  "purpose": "The code reads a Jupyter Notebook, modifies specific parameters for different stock names, executes the notebook with these parameters, and saves the output notebooks.",
  "sources": "Reading the notebook file 'Stock display.ipynb' and the parameter extraction functions from nbparameterise.",
  "sinks": "Executing the modified notebook with nbclient.execute(), writing output notebooks to files.",
  "flows": "Read notebook -> extract parameters -> modify parameters -> execute notebook -> save output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs standard parameter substitution and execution.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a notebook, extracts parameters, iterates over a list of stock names, updates parameters accordingly, executes the notebook, and saves each output with a different filename. The functions used are from nbparameterise and nbclient, standard tools for parameterizing and executing notebooks. No suspicious data flow, obfuscated code, or malicious activities such as network transmission or file manipulation outside intended purposes are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate example of parameterizing and executing a Jupyter Notebook for different stock symbols. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is straightforward and uses well-known libraries without suspicious modifications.",
