  "purpose": "Automate the process of parameterizing and executing a Jupyter notebook for different stock symbols, then save the outputs.",
  "sources": "Reading the notebook file, extracting parameters, substituting parameter values, executing the notebook, and writing output files.",
  "sinks": "Writing output notebook files; no untrusted data flows or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Extract parameters from notebook -> substitute stock name -> execute notebook -> save output file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual data flows observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a notebook, extracts parameters, iterates over a list of stock names, updates parameters, executes the notebook, and saves the results. It uses standard libraries without any suspicious patterns. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code is present. The flow is straightforward and typical for notebook automation. No network activity, secrets, or backdoors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the script. The high confidence levels further support this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard automation script for parameterizing and executing notebooks with different stock symbols. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
