{
  "purpose": "The code reads a Jupyter notebook, extracts parameters, updates them with stock names, executes the notebook with these parameters, and saves the output notebooks.",
  "sources": "Reading the notebook file ('Stock display.ipynb'), extracting parameters, and writing new notebook files.",
  "sinks": "Executing the modified notebooks and writing output files.",
  "flows": "Notebook file reading -> parameter extraction -> parameter update -> notebook execution -> saving output notebooks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears to perform standard notebook parameterization and execution.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a notebook, modifies parameters for each stock symbol, executes the notebooks, and saves the results. All operations are related to notebook processing and file I/O. There is no network communication, no data exfiltration, and no suspicious code execution beyond standard nbclient usage. No sensitive data handling, environment variables, or potential injection points are present. The use of nbparameterise and nbclient libraries is appropriate for notebook automation and does not raise security concerns. Overall, the code performs a typical parameterized notebook run with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard notebook automation script that processes stock data parameterization and execution. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious anomalies, or security risks detected. It appears safe and benign.",
