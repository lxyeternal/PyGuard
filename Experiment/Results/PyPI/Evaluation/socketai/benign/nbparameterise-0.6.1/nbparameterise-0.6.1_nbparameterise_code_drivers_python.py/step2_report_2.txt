  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code performs static analysis, extracting parameters, comments, and reconstructing code. No signs of malicious activity are evident.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis. Security risk is 0, which is reasonable given the benign description.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, justified by thorough reasoning.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe static analysis. No malicious activity or suspicious code.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware score is 0, which matches the benign assessment. Security risk is 0.1—slightly higher but still low, perhaps reflecting minimal concern about code modification potential.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The code is a utility for static analysis and code rewriting. No malicious intent.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware score is 0, consistent with the analysis. Security risk is 0, justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The code is a static code analysis and modification utility. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware score is 0, matching the benign nature. Security risk is 0.1, acknowledging minor potential if parameters are untrusted, but overall low.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar utility, no malicious activity. Focused on static analysis.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware score is 0, matching the benign description. Security risk is 0.2, slightly higher, possibly due to the potential impact of code modifications if parameters are maliciously crafted.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** The security risk score of 0.2 seems slightly conservative but acceptable given the potential for code modification. No evidence of actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security risk scores:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, with one at 0.2. Given the static analysis nature and absence of network or system modifications, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports — justified.\n- **Risk:** Slightly conservative but acceptable at 0.1 or 0.2, considering potential misuse if parameters are maliciously crafted, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports' scores are consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary. The code is a benign static analysis and code rewriting utility with no malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores reflect the minimal threat posed by static code analysis alone.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for potential misuse if parameters are malicious, but no actual risk observed)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reasoning above.",
