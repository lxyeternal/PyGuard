{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to parse Python source code, extract variable definitions, and rebuild code with modified parameters, primarily for static analysis and code transformation.",
  "sources": "Reads Python source code as string input, tokenizes code, and parses AST for variable assignments and comments.",
  "sinks": "Replaces assignment values in source code, generates new code strings with updated parameters.",
  "flows": "Source: Parsing source code to extract comments and assignments -> Transformation: Replacing variable values in code -> Sink: Outputting modified code string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code performs static analysis and code rewriting, with no network or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script analyzes Python source code to identify variable definitions and comments, using AST parsing and tokenization. It defines functions to check AST nodes for specific value types, extract comments, find assignments, and reconstruct code with modified parameter values. No network operations, file I/O, or external system interactions are present. The code's purpose appears to be static code analysis and safe code modifications, with no indications of malicious behavior or malicious code execution paths. No obfuscated or suspicious language features are used; the code structure is straightforward and intended for code manipulation tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for static code analysis and code rewriting. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It focuses on parsing, analyzing, and modifying Python code safely. No security risks or malicious indicators are present.",
