  "purpose": "Static analysis utility for extracting parameter definitions, comments, and values from Python code, and rebuilding code with modified parameters.",
  "sources": "AST parsing of code strings, tokenization for comments, reading assignment statements.",
  "sinks": "Reconstruction of code via 'repr()' for parameter values; no external data or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Source AST nodes to reconstructed code strings through string manipulation and 'repr()' substitution.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected; straightforward static analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static parsing of Python code to extract parameter definitions and comments, then rebuilds code with updated parameter values. It uses 'ast' and 'tokenize' modules safely, with no external data flow or system effects. The use of 'repr()' for code regeneration is standard and not malicious. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The code's structure is clear, and the analysis aligns with the purpose of static code management. The security implications are minimal, with no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis and code rewriting utility with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, risk score approximately 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
