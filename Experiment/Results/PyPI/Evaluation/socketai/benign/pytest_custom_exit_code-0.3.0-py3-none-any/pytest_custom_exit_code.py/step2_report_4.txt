  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality and Behavior:**\n   - The code is a pytest plugin that adds command-line options (`--suppress-no-test-exit-code` and `--suppress-tests-failed-exit-code`) to control whether certain exit codes are suppressed.\n   - During pytest session finish, it imports pytest exit code constants (handling different pytest versions) and, based on user options, may override the session's exit status to `ok` (success), effectively hiding certain failures.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration.\n   - The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical pytest plugin patterns.\n\n2. **Assessment of Maliciousness or Security Risks:**\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n   - The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.\n   - The only modification is to pytest's exit status, which is a legitimate extension for CI/CD pipelines or user convenience.\n   - No external network activity or data manipulation is involved.\n\n3. **Review of Reported Scores:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - Security risk scores are very low or zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating the reviewers agree on benignity.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as a standard pytest plugin with no malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Logical Issues:**\n   - The code relies on internal pytest modules (`_pytest.main`), which could change in future pytest versions. However, this is a known and accepted practice for extending pytest.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident.\n   - The code's purpose is to provide user options to suppress certain exit codes, which is common in CI environments.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency and Justification:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's benign behavior.\n   - The malware scores are appropriately zero.\n   - The security risk scores are justified as minimal.\n   - The logic and analysis in reports are sound and do not overstate potential issues.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low; mainly the potential for misuse if user intentionally manipulates exit codes, but this is a legitimate feature)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign pytest plugin extension with no malicious or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate, and their scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is safe, straightforward, and serves a legitimate purpose. It does not pose security threats or malware risks.",
