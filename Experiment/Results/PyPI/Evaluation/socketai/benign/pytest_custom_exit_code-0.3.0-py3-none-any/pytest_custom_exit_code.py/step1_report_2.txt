{
  "purpose": "The code customizes pytest behavior by adding command-line options and modifying exit codes based on user preferences.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration options via 'session.config.getoption' and imports from pytest and _pytest.main modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential modification of 'session.exitstatus' based on conditions, influencing pytest's exit code behavior.",
  "flows": "User supplies command-line options -> code reads options -> conditional logic alters 'session.exitstatus' to suppress certain exit codes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior. The code modifies exit codes based on user options, which is standard for pytest customization.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to add custom options to pytest CLI and modifies exit codes at the end of a pytest session based on these options. It imports constants from pytest or _pytest.main depending on pytest version. The logic is straightforward: if certain options are set, it overrides the exit status to indicate success regardless of test results, which can be useful for CI pipelines to suppress failures. There are no signs of malicious code such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code's purpose is to manipulate pytest's exit behavior, which is a legitimate use case.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended to customize pytest exit behavior. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is well-structured and relies on standard pytest mechanisms without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
