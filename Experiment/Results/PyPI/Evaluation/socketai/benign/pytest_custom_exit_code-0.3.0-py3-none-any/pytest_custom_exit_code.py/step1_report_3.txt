{
  "purpose": "This code extends pytest functionality by adding custom command-line options to control exit codes based on test results.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration options from command line arguments and the pytest session object; imports from pytest modules.",
  "sinks": "Modifies session.exitstatus to potentially suppress certain exit codes based on user options.",
  "flows": "User inputs command line options -> pytest_sessionfinish function reads options -> modifies session.exitstatus if conditions match.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides additional pytest command-line options to suppress specific exit codes, and conditionally alters the exit status at the end of a pytest session based on these options. It imports standard pytest modules and handles different pytest versions gracefully. The logic is straightforward and aligned with typical pytest plugin patterns. No obfuscated code, external network interactions, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pytest plugin extension that manages test run exit codes with user-configurable options. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior.",
