{
  "purpose": "The code extends pytest functionality by adding custom command-line options to suppress specific exit codes related to test results.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration options via 'session.config.getoption()' and imports from internal pytest modules and enums.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies 'session.exitstatus' based on untrusted user options, which can influence test suite exit behavior.",
  "flows": "User provides command-line options -> code reads these options -> based on conditions, it modifies 'session.exitstatus' to suppress certain exit codes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Uses standard pytest APIs and conditional logic to modify behavior. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or suspicious variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily extends pytest by adding custom command-line options to control exit code behavior. It imports from pytest's internal modules, which may change in future pytest versions, but this is standard practice for extending pytest. The logic to modify 'session.exitstatus' based on options is straightforward and intended to customize test exit behavior. No evidence of malicious activity, code injection, or malicious data handling. The code does not perform network operations, file manipulations, or data exfiltration. Its purpose appears solely to customize test suite exit statuses based on user preferences.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pytest extension for customizing exit codes based on command-line options. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe, with a low malware score.",
