{
  "purpose": "The code customizes pytest command-line options and modifies pytest session exit status based on user options.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line options via session.config.getoption() and imports exit code constants from pytest modules.",
  "sinks": "Modifies session.exitstatus based on user options and exit codes, potentially affecting test suite behavior.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line options influences the conditional logic which alters the session.exitstatus variable.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code behaves as a typical pytest plugin for controlling exit codes.",
  "analysis": "The code adds custom pytest command-line options for suppressing specific exit codes. During pytest session finish, it attempts to import exit status constants from pytest, using different import paths based on pytest version. It then checks user-specified options to determine whether to override certain exit codes with a success code. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions. The logic appears to be standard plugin behavior to control pytest exit codes, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign pytest plugin that provides user options to suppress certain pytest exit codes. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard pytest plugin patterns.",
