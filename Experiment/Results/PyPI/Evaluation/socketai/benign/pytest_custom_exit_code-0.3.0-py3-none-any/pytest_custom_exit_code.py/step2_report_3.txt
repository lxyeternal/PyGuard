  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a pytest plugin that adds command-line options to suppress certain exit codes.\n- The code imports constants from pytest or _pytest.main depending on pytest version, then modifies `session.exitstatus` based on user options.\n- No reports indicate network activity, data exfiltration, code obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The logic is straightforward, aimed at customizing pytest behavior, and no suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, with one at 0.1, which seems reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain any issues or malicious behavior.\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes:** No logical errors or flaws are identified.\n- **Scores:** The scores assigned (mostly 0, one at 0.1) are reasonable.\n- **Malware score justification:** The code does not perform any malicious actions; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made; the code's behavior is transparent and standard.\n- **Consistency of scores:** The scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The code is a typical pytest plugin for controlling exit codes.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident.\n- The slight security risk score of 0.1 might be due to the fact that modifying exit codes can potentially be misused if misconfigured, but this is a low concern given the context.\n\n### Final estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard plugin behavior with minimal security implications)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is a benign pytest plugin that adds options to suppress certain exit codes. It is well-structured, transparent, and poses no security risks or malware concerns.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- No changes needed; the current scores are appropriate.\n- The code should be considered safe and non-malicious.\n\n**Work through the reasoning step-by-step:**\n- No malicious actions detected.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- Behavior aligns with standard pytest plugin practices.\n- Security implications are minimal and well-understood.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score of 0.1.",
