{
  "purpose": "The code customizes pytest command-line options and modifies pytest session exit statuses based on user options.",
  "sources": "The code reads user-defined command-line options via 'session.config.getoption'. It also imports constants from pytest modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies 'session.exitstatus' based on input options, which could influence the process exit code.",
  "flows": "Input command-line options -> conditional checks -> modification of 'session.exitstatus' -> process exit behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, or unusual dynamic execution observed. The code mainly deals with configuration and exit code handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines pytest hook functions to add custom command-line options and to modify the pytest session exit status based on these options. It carefully imports pytest constants depending on pytest version. It adjusts the exit status to suppress certain exit codes if specified by the user. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration. The logic is straightforward and related to test execution management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate pytest plugin snippet used for customizing exit codes based on user options. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply manipulates pytest behavior as intended.",
