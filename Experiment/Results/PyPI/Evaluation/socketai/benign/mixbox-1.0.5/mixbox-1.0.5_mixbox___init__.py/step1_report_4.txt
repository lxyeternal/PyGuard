{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define metadata for a Python package, specifically importing the version information.",
  "sources": "Importing __version__ from a local module 'version'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or user input handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow, as it only imports a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is simple and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard header for a Python package, importing version info. It contains no suspicious or malicious constructs. No data input, no code execution, no external communications, or other risky behaviors. The only potential concern is if the imported __version__ variable is maliciously altered within the 'version' module, but that cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, typical of package metadata definition, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
