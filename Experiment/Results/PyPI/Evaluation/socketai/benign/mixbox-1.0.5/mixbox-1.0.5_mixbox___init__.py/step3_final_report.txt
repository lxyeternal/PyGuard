  "purpose": "Import the __version__ attribute from the local version module to access package version information.",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__ attribute from the .version module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import of __version__ from .version, with no data flow to external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statement with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard import of a version attribute from a local module. It contains no dynamic code, user input, or external data sources. The only potential concern is if the .version module is maliciously altered, which cannot be determined from this snippet alone. The code is not obfuscated, nor does it contain malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of this code. The slight security risk score in report 4 reflects the potential if the version module is compromised, but this is speculative and outside the scope of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security concern regarding the version module's integrity is acknowledged but cannot be confirmed from this snippet. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk.",
