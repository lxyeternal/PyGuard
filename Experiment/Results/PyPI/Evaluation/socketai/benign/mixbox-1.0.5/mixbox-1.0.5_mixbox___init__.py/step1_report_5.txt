  "purpose": "Import the version information from a local module, likely for version tracking or display.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing __version__ from a local module .version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only static import occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, standard, and properly structured.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a comment header and a single import statement for __version__ from a relative module. There are no functions, data inputs, or dynamic code execution. The import appears to be for version management purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving a typical purpose of version tracking. No malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies detected.",
