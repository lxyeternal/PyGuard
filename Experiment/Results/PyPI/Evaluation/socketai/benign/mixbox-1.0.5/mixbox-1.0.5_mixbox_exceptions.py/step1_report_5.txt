  "purpose": "Provides a context manager to ignore specified exceptions, facilitating cleaner exception handling in Python code.",
  "sources": "Imports the contextlib module; defines a function 'ignored' that yields a context manager.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; no dangerous operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The 'ignored' function creates a context manager that suppresses specified exceptions during its scope.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code appears standard and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple, standard utility for exception suppression using Python's contextlib. It mirrors the built-in contextlib.ignored introduced in Python 3.4, providing backward compatibility or custom usage. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing a common utility function without malicious intent or security risks. It is standard, straightforward, and safe.",
