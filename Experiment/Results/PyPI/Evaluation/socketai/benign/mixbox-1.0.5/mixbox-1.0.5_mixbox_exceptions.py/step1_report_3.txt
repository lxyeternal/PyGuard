{
  "purpose": "Provides a context manager to ignore specified exceptions in Python code.",
  "sources": "The function `ignored()` uses *exceptions as input, but primarily reads from the `try` block where it yields control.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or cause data leaks; the code does not handle external inputs or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input: exceptions specified by the user; flow passes through the `try` block, but no external data or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected. The code comments and structure are standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward context manager that ignores specified exceptions during its block. It uses standard Python `contextlib` features and has no indications of malicious intent. The code is simple, well-documented, and does not perform any network, file, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely for exception handling convenience. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
