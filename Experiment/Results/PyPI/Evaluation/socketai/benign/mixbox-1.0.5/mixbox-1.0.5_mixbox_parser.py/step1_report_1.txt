{
  "purpose": "The code defines an abstract base class for parsing XML-based security documents (such as STIX), including version and root element validation, and object creation from XML files.",
  "sources": "Reading input from xml_file parameter in parse_xml_to_obj and parse_xml methods, including file paths or file-like objects; calling get_etree_root and get_etree functions to parse XML data.",
  "sinks": "Building object instances from parsed XML data; assigning namespace and schema location mappings to objects.",
  "flows": "Input XML data is parsed into an XML tree, then validated for version and root tag, then used to build objects, with namespace and schema data stored in objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Use of standard exception handling, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic code execution or network activities.",
  "analysis": "The code implements an abstract parser with version and root element validation, raising custom exceptions if invalid. It reads XML input via external functions, performs validation, and constructs object models. No suspicious data handling, external network connections, or malicious behaviors are present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures are detected. The code appears to be a standard, security-conscious XML parser for structured documents.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured XML parser designed for security documents, with proper validation and exception handling. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. It appears safe and purpose-driven without evidence of malicious intent.",
