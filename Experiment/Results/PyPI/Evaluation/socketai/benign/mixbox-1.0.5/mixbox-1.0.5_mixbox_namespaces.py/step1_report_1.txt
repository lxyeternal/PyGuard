{
  "purpose": "Provides utilities and data structures for managing XML namespaces, including registration, lookup, and string generation for namespace declarations.",
  "sources": "Imports collections, copy, ordered_set, and six modules; reads global namespace variables and class methods for namespace management.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; code primarily manipulates namespace data internally, with no network or system command execution.",
  "flows": "Uses internal methods to register, lookup, and manipulate namespace objects; no external data flows or untrusted inputs to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines namespace data structures, exception handling for namespace conflicts, and utility functions for managing namespace sets. It carefully manages prefix-namespace mappings, schemas, and string outputs for XML declarations. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or system commands are present. The automatic registration of namespace constants is a benign feature. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, well-structured namespace management library with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a namespace utility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily handles internal data management and output generation related to XML namespaces. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are detected.",
