{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility classes and functions for managing XML namespaces, including registration, lookup, subset creation, and string generation for XML namespace declarations and schema locations.",
  "sources": "The code reads from internal class methods, namespace registration functions, and external modules (collections, copy, ordered_set, six). It also reads all global namespace definitions with a loop that registers all variables starting with 'NS_'.",
  "sinks": "The code generates strings for XML namespace declarations and schema locations; it does not execute untrusted input directly or write data externally. It uses standard library functions without executing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves creating and managing namespace objects, adding/removing namespaces and prefixes, and generating strings for XML serialization. The flow is internal data management with no external network or system commands involved.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is standard for namespace management, with some use of dynamic iteration and copy for internal state management. No suspicious patterns or unusual code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures and exceptions for managing XML namespaces, with methods for adding, removing, and querying namespaces and prefixes. It ensures invariants and validates internal state via assertions and dedicated methods. The use of deepcopy prevents side effects during merging. Namespace registration occurs at module load via automatic registration of globals starting with 'NS_'. The overall design is consistent with namespace management, and no external or malicious operations are present. No data leakage, code injection, or system harm mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured implementation for managing XML namespaces with no malicious intent. It does not perform any network operations, execute untrusted data, or contain backdoors. The risk of malicious behavior is very low.",
