  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package, handling version retrieval, dependencies, and optional backports.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from a file, reads README, Python version info, attempts to import optional modules via exec()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows, no network or system modifications, no external data handling",
  "flows": "Version file read -> optional imports via exec() -> setup() call",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() for importing modules, which is unconventional but controlled",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging, with no malicious or obfuscated code. The use of exec() is atypical but limited to known modules, posing no security threat. No untrusted data, network activity, or secrets are present. All dependency management and version handling are straightforward. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The only minor concern is the use of exec() for conditional imports, which is a known pattern in setup scripts but does not pose a security risk here.",
