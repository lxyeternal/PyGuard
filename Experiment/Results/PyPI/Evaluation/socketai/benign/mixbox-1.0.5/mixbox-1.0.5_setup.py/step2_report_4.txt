  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The script is a standard setup.py, reading version info, README, managing dependencies based on Python version, and attempting optional imports. No suspicious code, no untrusted data, no network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Completely consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, noting the use of `exec()` for importing backports. While unconventional, it's used here for known modules, not arbitrary code execution.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.9 (slightly high but justified given the use of `exec()`).\n- **Assessment:** The use of `exec()` is mildly unusual but not malicious in this context. No evidence of malicious intent or code obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard setup with dependency management and version reading. No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=1.\n- **Justification:** The risk score is set to 1, which seems high. The code does not perform any risky operations; the only unusual part is the use of `exec()`, which is controlled and limited to known modules.\n- **Recommendation:** The risk score should be lowered to reflect the benign nature, perhaps around 0.1 or 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous, standard setup, noting the use of `exec()` for backports. The report considers the `exec()` as a mild concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The code is standard, with the only mild concern being `exec()`, which is not malicious here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as others, no suspicious activity, dependency management, version reading.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. No malicious code or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign very low risk (0 or 0.1). The only exception is Report 3, which assigns 1. Given the code's benign nature, the risk should be low, around 0.1 at most, mainly due to the unconventional use of `exec()`.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (mild concern over `exec()` usage, but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured setup script with no malicious intent. The use of `exec()` is unconventional but controlled and does not pose a security risk here. The scores should reflect this benign nature.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the typical interpretation of such setup scripts.",
