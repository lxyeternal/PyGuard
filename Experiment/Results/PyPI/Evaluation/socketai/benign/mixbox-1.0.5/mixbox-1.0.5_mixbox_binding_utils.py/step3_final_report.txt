  "sources": "Input parameters, XML nodes, attributes, and text content.",
  "sinks": "Internal data processing; no external system calls or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and XML nodes through validation and formatting functions; no external data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions for XML handling, date/time formatting, timezone management, and data encoding. It uses well-known libraries (lxml, six) and employs typical patterns for data validation and escaping. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The functions process data from trusted sources and do not perform any system modifications or external communications. The overall structure is clear, and no anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility library for XML processing and data formatting, with no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks detected.",
