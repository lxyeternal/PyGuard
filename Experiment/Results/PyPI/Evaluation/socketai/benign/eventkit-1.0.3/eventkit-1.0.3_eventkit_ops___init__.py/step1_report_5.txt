  "flows": "No data or control flow present; the code does not execute or process any input.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a comment with no functional code, suspiciously minimal for a source file. No hidden code or obfuscated segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is only a comment string with no executable code, data input, or data output. It does not read data, process input, or perform any operations. No suspicious or malicious patterns are visible. The simplicity suggests either an incomplete snippet or placeholder text.",
  "conclusion": "There is no malicious behavior, security risk, or obfuscation evident in this code snippet. It appears to be a placeholder or incomplete module header without any functional code.",
