  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**  \n   - **Issue present?** No. The code is just a string comment with no executable code.  \n   - **Errors or flaws?** None. The reasoning correctly identifies that there's no malicious or risky code.  \n   - **Scores:**  \n     - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n     - Risk: 0 (correct)  \n   - **Justification for scores:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. No change needed.\n\n2. **Report 2**  \n   - **Issue present?** No. Same as above—only a comment string.  \n   - **Errors or flaws?** None. The analysis is consistent.  \n   - **Scores:**  \n     - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n     - Risk: 0 (correct)  \n   - **Justification:** The report's assessment is accurate.\n\n3. **Report 3**  \n   - **Issue present?** No. The snippet is just a string comment.  \n   - **Errors or flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound.  \n   - **Scores:**  \n     - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n     - Risk: 0 (correct)  \n   - **Justification:** No change needed.\n\n4. **Report 4**  \n   - **Issue present?** No. Only a docstring comment.  \n   - **Errors or flaws?** None.  \n   - **Scores:**  \n     - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n     - Risk: 0 (correct)  \n   - **Justification:** Accurate assessment.\n\n5. **Report 5**  \n   - **Issue present?** No. Only a comment.  \n   - **Errors or flaws?** None.  \n   - **Scores:**  \n     - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n     - Risk: 0 (correct)  \n   - **Justification:** The conclusion is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code snippet is only a comment string with no executable or malicious code.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the nature of the code, I agree with the existing scores:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is harmless, purely informational, and contains no security concerns.",
