{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, reading README and executing 'version.py' to set version info.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file and executes 'version.py' to assign '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "Reads input from local files; executes 'version.py' to set version variable.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'exec()' to run 'version.py', which could be risky if the file is compromised, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script with no network activity, no untrusted input, and no suspicious code. The use of 'exec()' for versioning is standard but relies on the trustworthiness of 'version.py'. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no anomalies beyond the common pattern of dynamic version assignment.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign setup configuration with no signs of malware or malicious obfuscation. The only minor concern is the use of 'exec()' to load version info, which should be verified for integrity in the supply chain. Overall, the code is safe and aligns with best practices for packaging.",
