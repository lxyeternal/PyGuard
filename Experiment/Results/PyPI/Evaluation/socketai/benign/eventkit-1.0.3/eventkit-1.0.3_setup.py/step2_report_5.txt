  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is a standard setup script, with no malicious code or suspicious behavior detected. It correctly identifies that executing 'version.py' is typical and not inherently risky if the file is trusted.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. Given the benign nature, these seem reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No issues identified; the code is straightforward.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes that the script is standard and safe, with no suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. No concerns here.\n- **Justification:** No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is standard. The only note is the use of `exec()` to load version info, which is common but warrants trust in 'version.py'.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The report's confidence is high, and no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Justification:** The use of `exec()` is typical in setup scripts; unless 'version.py' is malicious, this is safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, with a note that executing 'version.py' could be a vector if that file is compromised. However, in the context of trusted code, this is acceptable.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1–0.2. Slightly higher, but still reasonable given the standard pattern.\n- **Justification:** No malicious code or behavior detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—standard setup script with the common pattern of executing 'version.py'. The concern about 'exec' is noted but is typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. Slightly higher, but still acceptable for a trusted setup script.\n- **Justification:** No actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Summary:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None. All reports agree.\n- **Use of `exec()` for versioning:** Common practice, but a potential risk if 'version.py' is compromised. However, in a controlled environment, this is standard.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Malware:** Not detected.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports due to the use of `exec()`, but this is a known pattern in packaging scripts, not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of malicious activity, the risk score should be very low, around 0.1 to 0.2, primarily due to the `exec()` pattern, which is standard but should be verified if the environment is untrusted.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the `exec()` pattern, which is common but should be reviewed in untrusted environments)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears benign, with no signs of malware or malicious obfuscation. The slight concern about `exec()` is standard in packaging scripts and does not indicate malicious intent.",
