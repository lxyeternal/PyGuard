{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'eventkit' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long description, executing 'version.py' for version information, and static data in setup() for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data flows, network operations, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to run code from 'version.py' which could pose risks if that file is maliciously altered, but this is common for dynamic version assignment. No other unusual code features or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs static configuration tasks: reading a README file, executing a version file to set the version variable, and calling setup() with package metadata. The 'exec' statement could be a vector if 'version.py' is compromised, but this is a typical pattern in package setup scripts. No input from external sources or untrusted data is processed during runtime. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no apparent malicious intent. The only minor concern is the use of 'exec' for versioning, which is common but could be risky if 'version.py' is tampered with. Overall, the code appears safe.",
