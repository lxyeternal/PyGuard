  "purpose": "Define the version information of the package as a tuple and a string.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the __version_info__ tuple; creation of __version__ string from the tuple.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Conversion of __version_info__ tuple elements into a dot-separated string stored in __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version string construction.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version tuple (__version_info__) and then constructs a version string (__version__) by joining the tuple elements. No input reading, no untrusted data, no dynamic code execution. The code appears to be standard version assignment typical in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard version information setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
