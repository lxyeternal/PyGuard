  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input involved.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version tuple to string via join operation.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a tuple of version components to __version_info__, then constructs a version string __version__ by joining these components with periods. It involves no external data, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscation. The code is a standard pattern for versioning in Python modules, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and standard for version declaration. There are no security risks, no malware, and no obfuscation. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and justified.",
