  "purpose": "Define the version information of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a tuple __version_info__ to generate a version string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The tuple __version_info__ flows into the string join operation to produce __version__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and standard for versioning; no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a tuple with version numbers, then joins them into a string representing the package version. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a typical version declaration used in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
