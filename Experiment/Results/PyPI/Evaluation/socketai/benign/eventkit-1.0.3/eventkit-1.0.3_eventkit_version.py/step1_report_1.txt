  "purpose": "Defines the version information for the module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version tuple and string concatenation for __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leakage or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A — straightforward assignment with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is simple and conventional for versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a tuple representing version numbers to __version_info__, then constructs a string __version__ by joining tuple elements with periods. This is a common pattern for defining package versions. No input reading, no data leaks, and no malicious behavior detected. The code is static, self-contained, and free of suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version definition snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to set version information for the package.",
