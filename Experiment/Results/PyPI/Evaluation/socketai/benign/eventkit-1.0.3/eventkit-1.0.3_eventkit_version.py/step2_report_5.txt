  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**  \n   All reports describe the code as a straightforward version assignment pattern: defining a tuple __version_info__ and constructing a string __version__ from it. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks, and no suspicious constructs. The code is static and conventional.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is a standard versioning pattern with no malicious or security issues. No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - confidence: 1 (high confidence)\n   - obfuscated: 0\n   - malware: 0\n   - securityRisk: 0\n\n   These scores seem reasonable given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports agree on zero malware and zero security risk, and the code is static and conventional, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The code does not pose any security threat.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any malicious activity—no dynamic code execution, no external data, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on static analysis, which is correct. No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple, static version declaration pattern with no dynamic or external components. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive elements. The reports correctly identify this.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is benign and standard.  \n- No issues, no vulnerabilities, no malware.  \n- Scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0. The reports are accurate, and the code is safe.",
