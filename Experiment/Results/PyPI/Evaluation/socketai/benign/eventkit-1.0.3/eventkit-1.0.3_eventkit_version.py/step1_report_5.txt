  "purpose": "Define the version information of the package/module",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version_info__ tuple and constructs a version string from it",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or external outputs",
  "flows": "The code converts version tuple to string and assigns it to __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed; straightforward version assignment",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a version info tuple with fixed integers, then creates a version string by joining the tuple elements. No external input, no dynamic execution, no secrets or obfuscated code. It appears to be a standard way to specify version info in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical version declaration with no malicious or security-sensitive behavior. It does not contain any malware or security risks.",
