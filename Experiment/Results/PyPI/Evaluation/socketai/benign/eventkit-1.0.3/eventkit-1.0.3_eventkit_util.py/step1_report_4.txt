{
  "purpose": "This code provides an asynchronous generator that yields time points at specified intervals, optionally until an end time.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time (dt.datetime.now), input arguments (start, end, step), and class constants (NO_VALUE).",
  "sinks": "The code calls asyncio.sleep with dynamically calculated seconds; no direct data leaks or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "System time (source) flows through calculations to determine sleep duration, which then flows into asyncio.sleep, then yields the timestamp.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution. The code's purpose is straightforward time management.",
  "analysis": "The code imports asyncio and datetime modules, defines a class for internal use, and creates a function to retrieve the event loop. The main feature is an async generator timerange, which calculates wait times based on various input formats, handling different time representations and optional end conditions. No external data sources or insecure practices are evident. The code appears to be a utility for scheduling or periodic tasks. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modification. There are no indications of malicious behavior or hidden backdoors. The calculations and logic are standard for time-based asynchronous iteration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for asynchronous timed iteration, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
