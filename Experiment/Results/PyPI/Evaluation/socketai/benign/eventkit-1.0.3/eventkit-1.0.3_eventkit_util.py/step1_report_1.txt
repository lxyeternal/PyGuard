{
  "purpose": "This code provides an asynchronous generator function to yield time points at regular intervals, optionally within a specified range, primarily for scheduling or timing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads current time with dt.datetime.now(), accepts start, end, and step parameters, which can be datetime objects, time objects, or numeric values.",
  "sinks": "Uses asyncio.sleep() to delay execution, but does not process or send untrusted data outside the local context; no data transmission, storage, or external effect observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are read and converted to datetime objects, then a loop calculates sleep durations based on the current time, yielding each scheduled time point after sleep.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behaviors detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs. The code's logic appears straightforward and intended for timing operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility for asynchronous time-based iteration, converting various input types into datetime objects and sleeping until each time point is reached. It correctly handles time zones, timedelta conversions, and quantization. No malicious code, external network interactions, or obfuscated patterns are present. It uses standard library functions with clear purpose and no hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility for asynchronous time scheduling. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs standard time calculations and asyncio sleep calls without external data transmission or system compromise behavior.",
