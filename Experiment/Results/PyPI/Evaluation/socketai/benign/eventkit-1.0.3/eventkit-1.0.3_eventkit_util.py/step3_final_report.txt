  "purpose": "Asynchronous generator yielding datetime objects at specified intervals, handling various input formats for scheduling or timing tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters 'start', 'end', and 'step'; calls 'dt.datetime.now()' repeatedly.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or file operations; purely local computations and sleeps.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> datetime conversions -> sleep until target time -> yield time point -> repeat.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard asynchronous timing utility converting various input types into datetime objects, sleeping until the scheduled time, and yielding each time point. It uses only standard libraries, with no external network or file interactions. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is straightforward and intended for scheduling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured asynchronous timer generator with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
