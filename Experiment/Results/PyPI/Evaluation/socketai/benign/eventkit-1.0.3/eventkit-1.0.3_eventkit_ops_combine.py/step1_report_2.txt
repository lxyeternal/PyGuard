  "purpose": "Define various classes for event handling and data stream manipulation, including merging, switching, concatenating, zipping, and chaining event streams.",
  "sources": "Event.create() calls, source.connect(), source += callback, source -= callback, source.disconnect()",
  "sinks": "emit() calls, disconnect() calls, potential data leaks via emitted data or connected callbacks",
  "flows": "Sources generate data → callbacks process data → emit or modify event streams → potential disconnection or termination of streams",
  "anomalies": "Use of functools.partial for callback management, dynamic source addition/removal, complex flow control, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious URL or network code, no obfuscated code or unusual language features",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive implementation of event stream manipulation classes with multiple join operators. It uses standard Python features such as functools.partial, deque, and defaultdict. No evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The code handles event streams carefully with proper connection and disconnection management. There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious URL calls, or dangerous system manipulations. The complexity appears to be for stream processing, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malware. The design relies on external event objects and callback mechanisms, which are typical in event-driven architectures. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate library for event stream processing without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, complex implementation of event stream operators for data flow management. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code uses standard Python techniques for event handling and callback management, with no suspicious network or system modifications. It is safe and does not pose a security threat.",
