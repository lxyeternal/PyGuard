{
  "purpose": "Defines various classes for combining and managing multiple event sources, such as merging, concatenating, switching, zipping, and chaining events.",
  "sources": "Reads from Event.create, event connection methods (connect, disconnect, +=, -=), and event attributes like done() and value().",
  "sinks": "Emits data via self.emit and connects callbacks to event sources, potentially handling untrusted input data, but no evidence of malicious data sinks or unauthorized data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sources -> connected callbacks -> internal state updates -> emit, disconnect, or modify sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of partial for dynamic callback creation is standard; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a framework for combining multiple event streams with various behaviors. It handles source management, connection/disconnection, and event emission in a structured manner. No obfuscated constructs or suspicious logic are present. The code primarily deals with event handling and source coordination, with no indication of malicious data manipulation, covert communication, or sabotage activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate event management framework without malicious intent. It manages multiple event sources and their combinations safely, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
