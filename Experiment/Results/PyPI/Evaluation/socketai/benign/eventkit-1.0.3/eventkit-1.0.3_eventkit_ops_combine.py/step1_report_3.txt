{
  "purpose": "Define various classes for composing, joining, and managing event sources in a reactive or event-driven system.",
  "sources": "Event.create() calls, source.connect(), source += cb, source -= cb, source.disconnect(), source.done()",
  "sinks": "emit() functions potentially sending data downstream; source.disconnect() and source -= cb potentially removing callbacks; no clear data leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "Sources are set via _set_sources methods, callbacks (_on_source_i, _on_source_s) process source data and emit outputs, disconnects clean up callbacks upon source completion.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present; code primarily manages event subscriptions and data flow without unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for combining and managing event sources, including merging, concatenating, switching, and zipping sources. All functions involve event subscriptions, callback management, and data emissions, with no external network or file operations. There are no signs of data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code appears to implement standard reactive event patterns with appropriate cleanup and management of sources and callbacks. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of event source management with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily handles event subscriptions, callback management, and data emissions in a typical reactive programming pattern.",
