  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules and version info.\n- No data processing, external communication, or runtime logic is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as import setup for a data pipeline framework.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — appropriate, no malware present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** 0.0 — no risks.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — fully confident.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above, straightforward import structure.\n- **Scores:** All zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk, with full confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct, no concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- Similar assessment, emphasizing no external data flow or suspicious code.\n- Scores: zero for malware, obfuscated, risk; confidence 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a minor security risk score (0.1), likely due to the generic nature of the import statements.\n- **Justification:** Since it's purely import statements, the risk is minimal but not zero, considering that in some contexts, import statements could be used maliciously if they import malicious modules. However, here they are internal modules, so the risk remains negligible.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but reasonable. No actual malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- Similar to others, with confidence 0.9 and small security risk (0.1). The reasoning aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** All zero, as expected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to conservative stance, but given the code's nature, this is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert evaluation:\n- The code is a straightforward import module for a data pipeline framework.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores across reports are consistent and justified.\n\n### My estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malware present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 — negligible, as no external or sensitive operations are involved.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. The code is benign, and no security concerns are warranted.",
