{
  "purpose": "The code defines an event-driven data pipeline framework with various operational modules and version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads static imports from internal modules and version variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data are present; no external network or data output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows are explicitly visible; the code only imports modules and version info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic code execution is evident. All imports are from internal modules and are standard for a modular framework.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from various internal modules related to event processing, data operations, and versioning. No executable logic, data handling, or external interactions are present. This appears to be a straightforward module import setup for a larger framework, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The absence of any network calls, input/output handling, or suspicious constructs indicates a benign intent. The code structure and naming conventions suggest it is a well-organized library setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script importing various modules for an event-driven data pipeline framework. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation is detected. It appears to be a standard modular import configuration for a larger system.",
