  "purpose": "Utilities for determining application-specific directories across different operating systems and environments.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., XDG_DATA_HOME, XDG_CONFIG_HOME, XDG_DATA_DIRS, XDG_CONFIG_DIRS, XDG_STATE_HOME, XDG_CACHE_HOME), system platform information, and user inputs via function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Path constructions and environment variable accesses are the primary sinks; no direct data leaks or external communications are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (environment variables, parameters) flows into path construction functions, which generate directory paths based on OS, environment, and parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Uses platform-specific code to access system folders, which is typical for such utilities. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names. The code is well-structured, with no unusual dynamic execution or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a set of functions to retrieve application data, config, cache, state, and log directories tailored to the OS and environment. It uses standard environment variables, system calls, and platform detection. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are present. The code's purpose is benign, serving as a utility for path management. Internal support functions for Windows folder retrieval are based on standard APIs, with fallback options. The self-test section simply prints directory paths with sample app names, with no hidden or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate utility module for managing application directories across platforms. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no malware, and poses no security risks. It is well-structured, with no obfuscated or malicious logic.",
