  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'appdirs' Python package, extracting version info and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'appdirs.py' for version info, 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' for descriptions.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations; no untrusted data sinks or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "File content read -> parse version info -> pass data into setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'ast.literal_eval' on local 'appdirs.py' to extract version; safe in context but could be risky if the file is maliciously altered.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script performing static file reads and version extraction. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The use of 'ast.literal_eval' is a common pattern for safely parsing version strings from local files. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected. The script's purpose is solely to prepare package metadata for distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign Python package setup routine with no malicious activity or security risks. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) due to file reading operations, which are standard in such scripts.",
