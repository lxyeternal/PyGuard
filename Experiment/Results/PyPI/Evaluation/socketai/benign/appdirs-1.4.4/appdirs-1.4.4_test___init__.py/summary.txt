  "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assessments are consistent across reports. A minor adjustment in Report 1's security risk score from 0.3 to 0.2 is advised for consistency. Overall, the dependency is considered safe with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low risk score (~0.1-0.2)."
