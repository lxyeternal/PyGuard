  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script that performs some operation, potentially involving input/output, but the specific intent cannot be determined without seeing the actual code content.",
  "sources": "Input sources include any user input functions, environment variables, or file reads present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of system commands, especially if untrusted data is used without validation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs or external systems).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are detected based on the provided code snippet.",
  "analysis": "Without the specific code content, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. The general process involves identifying data input points, tracing their flow through the code, and checking for unsafe operations or data leaks. Since the code content was not provided, no specific malicious patterns or security issues could be identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of visible code and analysis, there are no detected malicious behaviors or security risks in the provided input. However, a detailed review of the actual code is necessary to confirm this assessment.",
