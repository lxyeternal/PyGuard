  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code review for malicious patterns, obfuscation, and security issues.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, function parameters, external files, network sources, environment variables, system commands, external services.",
  "sinks": "System commands, file writes, network transmissions, environment variables, external services, stdout.",
  "flows": "Sources (inputs, environment variables, user inputs) to sinks (system commands, network, files) potentially without validation, possibly involving dynamic execution or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; potential dynamic imports or eval observed but not confirmed malicious; no suspicious domains/IPs or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code appears standard, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Dynamic execution points are noted but not deemed malicious without evidence. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The data flow from sources to sinks seems typical for utility scripts. The confidence score is high due to the lack of suspicious patterns. The security risk is low, with scores around 0.2, except for Report 1 where a slight reduction from 0.3 to 0.2 is recommended to better align with the benign findings.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assessments are consistent across reports. A minor adjustment in Report 1's security risk score from 0.3 to 0.2 is advised for consistency. Overall, the dependency is considered safe with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low risk score (~0.1-0.2).",
