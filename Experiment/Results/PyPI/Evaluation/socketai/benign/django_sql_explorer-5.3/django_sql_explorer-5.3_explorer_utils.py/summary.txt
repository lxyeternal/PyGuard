  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard, security-conscious utility functions for a Django web app, with no signs of malicious activity or malware. The main consideration is ensuring that user inputs used in 'swap_params' are properly sanitized before SQL execution to prevent injection vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are appropriate given the context. Vigilance in input validation is recommended, but overall, the code is safe and well-structured."
