  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, handling build, release, and tagging commands.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (sys.argv), external functions (get_version), static command strings in os.system calls",
  "sinks": "os.system calls executing build, upload, and git commands based on sys.argv inputs",
  "flows": "sys.argv triggers os.system commands; commands are static or controlled, not dynamically constructed from untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with command strings influenced by sys.argv, which could be risky if inputs are manipulated, but commands are static and checked",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with controlled external command execution. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. The use of os.system() with static commands based on specific sys.argv values minimizes injection risk. The get_version() function's implementation is external but presumed benign. The overall logic is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The main concern is the potential for command injection if sys.argv is manipulated, but given the checks for specific arguments, this risk is minimal. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk score around 0.2 reflects cautious acknowledgment of the os.system usage. The confidence level is high (0.9) due to the clarity and control in the code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup with controlled command execution. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. The scores assigned are appropriate, with a slight security concern due to the use of os.system, but overall, the code is safe.",
