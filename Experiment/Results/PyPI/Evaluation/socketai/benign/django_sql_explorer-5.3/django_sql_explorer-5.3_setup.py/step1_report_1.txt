  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, managing package configuration, requirements, and build/release commands.",
  "sources": "os.system calls, sys.argv inputs, file reading for requirements and README, environment variables (indirectly via commands).",
  "sinks": "os.system calls executing build, upload, and git commands; reading local files; executing external commands.",
  "flows": "sys.argv inputs trigger os.system commands that run shell commands (build, release, tag); reading requirement files and README for package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of os.system to execute shell commands is standard but could be risky if inputs are not controlled; here, commands are hardcoded and not influenced by untrusted input.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for Python packaging. It includes command-line options for building, releasing, and tagging releases, utilizing os.system to execute shell commands. These commands are static and controlled within the script. No external inputs influence the shell commands, reducing risk. The script reads requirement files and README documentation for package info. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors like data exfiltration, malware, or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script performs package configuration and deployment tasks without any signs of malicious intent or malicious code. It uses standard Python packaging practices, with shell commands that are static and controlled. No malware or security risks are detected.",
