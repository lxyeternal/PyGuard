  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, well-structured, and secure, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. Its primary security consideration is the effectiveness of the external passes_blacklist() function. The overall security risk is low, and the code aligns with best practices for query management and logging in Django applications."
