{
  "purpose": "This code provides various data export classes (CSV, JSON, Excel) for exporting query results in different formats.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from 'app_settings', query results from 'self.query.execute_query_only()', and input parameters such as 'format' and 'delim' from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include JSON serialization, CSV writing, and Excel file creation, which could be exploited if untrusted data is maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from query execution results through format-specific '_get_output' methods, then serialized or written to file-like objects; user input (e.g., 'format', 'delim') influences processing but are handled safely within context.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are evident. The code uses standard library functions and common third-party libraries (e.g., xlsxwriter). No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data serialization in multiple formats with standard libraries. It uses input parameters securely with default fallbacks and proper escaping mechanisms. The dynamic import of exporter classes from settings is typical in modular designs. No signs of malicious data leakage, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code does not perform network operations, system modifications, or access sensitive data beyond query results, indicating low risk of supply chain attack or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of data export functionalities with no apparent malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It safely handles data serialization and filename generation. There are no suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns detected.",
