{
  "purpose": "Provides various data export functionalities (CSV, JSON, Excel) for query results within a Django application.",
  "sources": "Import statements, app_settings configurations, and method parameters such as 'format', 'query', and 'res'.",
  "sinks": "Data serialization points (json.dumps, csv.writer), file output streams (StringIO, BytesIO), and external library calls (xlsxwriter).",
  "flows": "Input data from query.execute_query_only() flows into serialization functions, which then write data to in-memory buffers for export.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. No obfuscated code, malicious network calls, or data exfiltration behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data export classes that serialize query results into CSV, JSON, or Excel formats. It uses standard libraries and external packages (csv, json, xlsxwriter) responsibly, with no dynamic code execution or suspicious data handling. No input validation or sanitization issues are evident, but the code relies on external query objects. There are no signs of malicious intent such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors. The usage appears legitimate for data exporting purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data exporting functionality with no detectable malicious or sabotage elements. It appears safe and consistent with expected data export modules in Django applications.",
