{
  "purpose": "Provides export functionality for query results in CSV, JSON, and Excel formats within a Django application.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from app_settings, executes queries, reads query metadata, and processes query results.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, but data is serialized into files or strings, and some data transformations occur.",
  "flows": "Query execution -> Data serialization (CSV/JSON/Excel) -> Output streams or strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code; standard serialization libraries used appropriately. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple exporter classes for exporting query results in different formats, utilizing standard Python and Django libraries. It reads configuration settings, executes queries, and serializes the data accordingly. There are no external network connections, no dynamic code execution, and no use of untrusted input that could lead to injection. The use of codecs, json, csv, and xlsxwriter libraries appears standard and safe. The code carefully handles data types for Excel export, such as UUIDs and datetime objects, and sanitizes filenames. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected in data processing or configuration handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of data export functionalities with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on well-established libraries and follows typical patterns for data serialization and file generation.",
