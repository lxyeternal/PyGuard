{
  "purpose": "Define and generate version information for a software package",
  "sources": "Accesses __version_info__ dictionary and releaselevel key, uses string formatting and concatenation",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the version string; no untrusted data sinks identified",
  "flows": "Reads version info from __version_info__, constructs version string in get_version(), returns version string as __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard versioning logic with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version info dictionary and a function to generate a version string based on that info. It asserts releaselevel validity, dynamically constructs version strings with conditional inclusion of patch and serial numbers, then assigns the result to __version__. No external input, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code performs simple data access and string formatting, typical for version management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version info generator with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
