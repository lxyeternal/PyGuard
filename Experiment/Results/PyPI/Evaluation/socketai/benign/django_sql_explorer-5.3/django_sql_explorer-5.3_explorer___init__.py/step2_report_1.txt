  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- The code defines a static dictionary `__version_info__` with version components.\n- The function `get_version()` constructs a version string based on this info.\n- No external inputs, no dynamic code, no network activity.\n- The code performs straightforward string formatting and data access.\n- The version string is assigned to `__version__`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is straightforward, static, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. This matches the code.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The logic is simple, correct, and well-structured.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- The code contains no signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n- All reports agree on malware score = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- The code is clear, with no obfuscation or unusual constructs.\n- All reports assign obfuscated = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated score of 0 is justified.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- The code is static, with no external inputs or outputs, no secrets, no dynamic code.\n- The purpose is purely version string formatting.\n- All reports assign securityRisk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- No hidden malicious intent or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The assertion on `releaselevel` ensures only valid release levels.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a simple, static version info generator.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.",
