  "purpose": "Define and retrieve version information for a software package based on a structured version info dictionary.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the __version_info__ dictionary to construct version strings.",
  "sinks": "The code returns the version string from get_version() without any external data sinks.",
  "flows": "The get_version function reads from __version_info__ and constructs a string to return.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version info dictionary with fixed numeric and string values. The get_version() function constructs a version string based on this data, with an assertion ensuring releaselevel validity. The function logic is straightforward, involving string formatting and conditional concatenation. The returned version string is then assigned to __version__. There are no external data inputs, no network operations, no suspicious logic, or code injection points. Overall, the code serves a simple purpose of version string formatting without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version information handler with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscation. The overall security risk is very low.",
