  "purpose": "Define and retrieve the version information of a software package.",
  "sources": "Read access to the __version_info__ dictionary and its values.",
  "sinks": "Return statement in get_version function.",
  "flows": "Access __version_info__ data → process data in get_version → return version string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external data sources.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a dictionary containing version details. The get_version function asserts the release level, constructs a version string based on the dictionary values, and returns it. The logic is straightforward, with no external inputs, no data leaks, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The code's purpose is solely to define and retrieve version info; it does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard versioning utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs simple data handling and string formatting without external dependencies or side effects.",
