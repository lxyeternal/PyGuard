  "purpose": "Defines static version information and constructs a version string based on this info.",
  "sources": "The __version_info__ dictionary providing version components.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "The get_version() function reads from __version_info__ and constructs a string; no external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static data access and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static version info dictionary with a function to generate a version string. It performs basic assertions to validate release level, then formats the version string accordingly. There are no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version string generator with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. All reports correctly assess this, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
