{
  "purpose": "Defines version information for a software package and provides a function to retrieve the version string.",
  "sources": "The version info dictionary (__version_info__) and its keys, the get_version() function, and its internal use of the dictionary to generate version strings.",
  "sinks": "The get_version() function returns a string; no untrusted data is processed or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "The code reads from the __version_info__ dictionary, processes data within get_version(), and returns a version string. No external data flows or interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code performs straightforward data formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version info dictionary with static version components. The get_version() function constructs a version string based on this data, with an assertion ensuring valid release levels. The process involves simple string formatting and conditional appending of version parts, all within standard Python syntax. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, no data leaks, and no external inputs or network interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version information generator with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply formats and returns version data based on predefined static variables.",
