  "purpose": "Define and generate the package version string based on version information.",
  "sources": "The version info dictionary __version_info__ is a source of data; the get_version() function reads from it.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; the code only formats and returns version strings.",
  "flows": "The code reads data from __version_info__ and outputs a formatted version string through get_version().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard dictionary access and string formatting without obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a version info dictionary with version components. The get_version() function constructs a version string based on the dictionary, including conditions for release level and patch number. The function performs assertions to ensure release level validity. The overall structure is straightforward, with no external input or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard version string generator based on predefined version info. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected. It appears to be a normal part of a package's version management.",
