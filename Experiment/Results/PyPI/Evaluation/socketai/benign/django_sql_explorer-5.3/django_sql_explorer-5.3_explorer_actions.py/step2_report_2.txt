  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  The code appears to function as intended: generating CSV or ZIP reports from querysets, using CSVExporter, temporary files, and proper response headers. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are evident.\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  Minor concerns include lack of explicit filename sanitization and resource cleanup, but these are standard in many implementations and not inherently dangerous.\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.  \n  The low risk score aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity is detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing minimal sanitization and resource management concerns.  \n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — consistent.  \n- **Note:** The potential filename injection via report titles is minor and unlikely to be exploited maliciously.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the straightforward nature of the code, with similar observations.  \n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, confirms the code's legitimacy, with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern: standard report generation, minimal security concerns, no malicious code.  \n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—no signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2), reflecting minor concerns about filename sanitization and resource cleanup, but nothing indicating a serious security threat.\n\n### **My Expert Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 — minor concerns about filename sanitization and resource management, but overall very low risk.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- The existing scores are reasonable and consistent with the code analysis.\n- The risk score could be slightly lowered to 0.1 if we want to be more conservative, but 0.2 remains acceptable given the minor concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                      |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1 - 0.2              |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is legitimate, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security concerns are typical in file handling code and do not constitute a significant threat. The existing report scores are appropriate.",
