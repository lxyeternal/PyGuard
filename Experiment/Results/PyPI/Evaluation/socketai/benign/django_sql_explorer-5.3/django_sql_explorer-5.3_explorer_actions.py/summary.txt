  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate report generator with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The only minor security concern involves filename sanitization, which could be improved but does not currently pose a significant threat. The scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a low risk score (~0.2), are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
