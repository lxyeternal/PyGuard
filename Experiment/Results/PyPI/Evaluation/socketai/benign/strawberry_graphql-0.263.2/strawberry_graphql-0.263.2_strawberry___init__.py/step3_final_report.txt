  "purpose": "This code serves as a static module initialization file for the Strawberry GraphQL Python library, importing various components and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; no data processing or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "Static import statements with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static module setup, importing internal components and defining __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling that could pose security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a security risk score of 0. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report appears to be an overly cautious default, not justified by the code content. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module initialization script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the minimal security risk score should be adjusted to zero for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
