{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and exports various components of the Strawberry GraphQL library, primarily importing modules and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Module imports from relative package paths and the __all__ list declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks is present; this is a static module setup without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident. The code appears to be standard library initialization code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements and the definition of __all__, which collectively serve to organize and expose the library's components. There are no user inputs, external data reads, or execution of dynamic code. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present. The structure and content are consistent with typical Python package initialization scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup for the Strawberry GraphQL library. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The likelihood of malicious intent is extremely low.",
