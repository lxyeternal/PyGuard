  "purpose": "This code defines a Python library for GraphQL called Strawberry, primarily consisting of import statements and an export list.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules and an __all__ list for exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; code is solely module imports and symbol exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs identified. The code is straightforward and appears to be a standard package __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports various modules and symbols to structure the library's API. There are no runtime data processing, external network calls, or dynamic code execution. No indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms. The code adheres to standard Python package initialization practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package initializer for the Strawberry GraphQL library, with no malicious or security-related concerns detected.",
