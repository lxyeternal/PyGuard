{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be the __init__.py file for the Strawberry GraphQL library, mainly importing modules and defining __all__ for package exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local package modules and the __all__ list definition.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data flows could cause security issues, such as network connections, file writes, or command executions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are apparent. The code only performs imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code constructs are present. The code strictly consists of standard import and export statements for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing modules related to the Strawberry GraphQL library and defining the public interface (__all__). It does not process input data, execute dynamic code, or interact with external systems. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident in these import/export statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script for a Python library with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply organizes module imports and exports, which is typical for a Python package __init__.py file.",
