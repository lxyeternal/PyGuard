  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a straightforward module that imports various internal components of the Strawberry GraphQL library and defines an `__all__` list to organize exports.\n- None of the reports identify any dynamic behavior, external data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n- All reports assign a high confidence level (1) and consistently rate malware, obfuscation, and security risks as zero or negligible.\n- One report (Report 3) notes a minimal security risk score of 0.1, but this appears to be a conservative placeholder rather than an indication of actual risk.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Code Content:\n- The code is purely static, consisting of import statements and an `__all__` list.\n- No runtime data processing, external inputs, or outputs are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are evident.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard for a Python package's `__init__.py` or module setup.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent in the assessments.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the static, import-only nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity, a score of 0 or very close to it is justified.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize this as standard package initialization code.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 as a very conservative placeholder, but 0 is more accurate)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, benign Python module setup for the Strawberry GraphQL library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 | No malicious code, no dynamic or external activity present.|\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 | Clear, straightforward import and export statements.       |\n| Security Risk  | 0                 | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or suspicious patterns.   |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed assessments and the nature of the code.",
