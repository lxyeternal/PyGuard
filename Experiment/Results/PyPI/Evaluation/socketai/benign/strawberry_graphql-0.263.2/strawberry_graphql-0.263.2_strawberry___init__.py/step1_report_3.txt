{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python module that imports various components related to a GraphQL library called Strawberry and defines the public API of the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules within the package, such as .directive, .parent, .permission, etc.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data; the code mainly performs imports and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "The code does not contain runtime data flows or untrusted data processing. It primarily sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden behaviors, or unusual patterns are present. The code is straightforward, involving only imports and an __all__ list.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module that imports various components of a GraphQL library. There are no functions, data processing, user input handling, or network operations. The import statements are relative and point to internal modules, and the __all__ list exports these components. There are no signs of malicious logic such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The overall structure and content are typical for a library __init__.py file or similar module setup.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code. It appears to be a benign module setup for a Python library. No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or suspicious constructs are present.",
