  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a static module setup with import statements and an `__all__` list. No data flows, external inputs, or dynamic code execution are present.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate; no issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly notes the static import structure with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, risk is 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment; no security concern.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, the code is a straightforward import/export module with no data processing or dynamic behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1—this is slightly above zero, but given the static nature, this seems overly cautious.  \n- **Recommendation:** The small non-zero security risk score might be a default or conservative placeholder, but given the static import pattern, it should remain at 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious or security risks detected; the small risk score should be adjusted to 0 for consistency.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Same as above, the code is a standard package initializer with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; risk is 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same as previous reports, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; risk is 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign static module setup with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data flows involving untrusted sources.\n- The only inconsistency is in **Report 3**, where the security risk score is set to 0.1 despite the static, import-only nature of the code. This should be adjusted to 0 for consistency and accuracy.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected across all reports)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks, data flows, or dynamic behavior)\n\nThis code is a standard, benign module initialization script typical for Python libraries. No security issues or malicious intent are evident.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nAdjust the security risk score in Report 3 from 0.1 to 0 to reflect the actual static and safe nature of the code. The other reports are accurate.",
