  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various components and types for a GraphQL library called Strawberry, primarily organizing and exporting different parts of the library.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules within the package, such as .directive, .parent, .permission, etc.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports various internal modules and consolidates their exports; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observable.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a collection of import statements and an __all__ declaration to control exports. It does not process external input, generate output, or perform any actions that could be malicious. No anomalies or security risks are evident from this static import structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module import and export configuration for a GraphQL library. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and poses no security threats.",
