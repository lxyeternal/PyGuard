{
  "purpose": "Define a type variable and an annotated type for use in GraphQL resolver functions within the Strawberry library, specifically to represent parent resolver values.",
  "sources": "Code imports (typing, strawberry), class definition, type variable declaration, annotation, docstring, example usage.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not handle external untrusted input or perform any operations that could lead to data leakage or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly sets up type annotations and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward, with proper use of typing and annotations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and the Strawberry GraphQL library to define a generic parent resolver type. It creates a TypeVar 'T' and an Annotated type 'Parent' for use in resolver functions. The accompanying docstring explains usage with an example, which appears typical for Strawberry's parent resolver pattern. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-documented implementation of a type annotation pattern for Strawberry GraphQL resolvers. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Overall, it appears safe and intended for typical use within Strawberry-based GraphQL schemas.",
