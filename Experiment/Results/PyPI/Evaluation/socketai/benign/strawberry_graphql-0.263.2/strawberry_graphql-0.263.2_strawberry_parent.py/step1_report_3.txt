{
  "purpose": "Defines a type annotation for parent resolver values in a Strawberry GraphQL schema, along with an example usage.",
  "sources": "The code reads the type annotations, class definitions, and the example docstring.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves defining a type variable, an annotated type, and a usage example demonstrating how the annotation is used within resolver functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are observed. The docstring includes an example but no executable or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a type alias for resolver parent data using Python's Annotated and TypeVar, specifically for use with Strawberry GraphQL. The class 'StrawberryParent' is defined but empty, serving as a marker. The example demonstrates typical usage in a resolver method with no indication of malicious intent. There are no network operations, data leaks, or other malicious behaviors. Overall, this appears to be standard schema annotation code with documentation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward definition of a custom type annotation for Strawberry GraphQL resolvers, with an example usage. No malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior detected.",
