  "purpose": "Defines a type alias 'Parent' for resolver parameters in Strawberry GraphQL schemas, indicating parent resolver data using a marker class.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code is purely type annotation and documentation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process or transmit untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is declarative for type hinting purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code introduces a marker class 'StrawberryParent' and a generic type alias 'Parent' using 'Annotated'. It serves as a utility for type hinting in Strawberry GraphQL resolvers, with an example demonstrating its usage. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present. The code is simple, well-documented, and aligns with standard practices. No external interactions or security-sensitive operations are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for type annotation in Strawberry GraphQL schemas. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk.",
