{
  "purpose": "Define a type alias for a parent resolver parameter using Python typing and annotations, specifically for use with the Strawberry GraphQL library.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' module, class definition, type variable creation, annotation assignment, and a docstring providing usage example.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, outputs, or external data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily sets up type annotations and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and primarily documentation with type aliasing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing constructs, defines a class 'StrawberryParent', and creates a type variable T. It then assigns 'Parent' as an Annotated type combining T and StrawberryParent, with a detailed docstring explaining usage in Strawberry GraphQL resolvers. The example shows typical usage patterns. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or security risks. All elements are consistent with standard type annotation practices in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type annotation setup for Strawberry GraphQL resolvers, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves to facilitate type-safe resolver parameters in GraphQL schemas.",
