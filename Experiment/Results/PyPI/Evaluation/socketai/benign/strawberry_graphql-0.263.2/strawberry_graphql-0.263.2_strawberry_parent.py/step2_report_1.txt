  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Obfuscation:**  \n   All reports consistently indicate that the code is straightforward, primarily defining type annotations and documentation for use with the Strawberry GraphQL library. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious constructs. The class `StrawberryParent` is an empty marker class, and the `Parent` type alias is a simple `Annotated` type combining a generic type variable with this marker.\n\n2. **Code Functionality and Logic:**  \n   The code's purpose is to create a type alias for resolver parameters in Strawberry GraphQL schemas, specifically for parent resolver data. The example usage demonstrates standard patterns in Strawberry, with no indication of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious intent or payloads.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** Also 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.  \n   - **Security Risk / Overall Risk:** Zero, as no external data handling, network operations, or security-sensitive actions are present.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**  \n   The reports correctly challenge any claims of vulnerabilities based solely on type annotations or documentation. There are no assumptions that could be challenged here because the code is purely declarative and documentation-oriented.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**  \n   The assigned scores (all zeros for malware and obfuscated, high confidence in benignity) are justified and consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.  \n- **Risk Score:** **0** — No security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Notes:\nGiven the nature of the code, even a higher risk score would be unwarranted unless future modifications introduce malicious behavior. The code is a typical utility pattern in Strawberry GraphQL schemas.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, well-documented, and serves a standard purpose in GraphQL schema definitions. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at **0**.  \n- No further security concerns are identified based on the provided code and reports.",
