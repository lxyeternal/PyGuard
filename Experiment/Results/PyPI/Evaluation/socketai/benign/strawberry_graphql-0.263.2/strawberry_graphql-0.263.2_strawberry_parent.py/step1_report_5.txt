  "purpose": "Define a type variable and an annotated type for use with the Strawberry GraphQL library to specify parent resolver values.",
  "sources": "TypeVar declaration, the StrawberryParent class, and the annotated Parent variable usage in the function parameter.",
  "sinks": "The annotated Parent type is used in a resolver method; however, it is a standard pattern in Strawberry and does not pose a risk by itself.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the type annotations to the usage in the resolver method, with no untrusted data input or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be straightforward type annotations and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic type variable T and an annotated type Parent for use with Strawberry's resolver framework. The class StrawberryParent is a placeholder class with no behavior. The Parent annotation is used in a resolver method to type a parameter as the parent resolver's value, in this case, UserRow. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The code follows standard patterns for Strawberry GraphQL schema definitions. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard usage pattern for the Strawberry GraphQL library to specify parent resolver parameters. There is no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious activity.",
