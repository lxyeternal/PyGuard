  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its intent, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward setup for type annotations in Strawberry GraphQL resolvers.\n- No untrusted data, external sinks, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code is consistent, well-documented, and aligns with standard practices.\n- The class `StrawberryParent` is an empty marker class, serving as a type hint.\n\n**Code Presence & Functionality:**\n- The code imports standard modules (`typing`, `strawberry`), defines a marker class, a type variable, and an annotated type alias `Parent`.\n- The usage example in the docstring demonstrates typical resolver patterns.\n- No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n**Security & Malware Assessment:**\n- No data flows from untrusted sources.\n- No external data sinks or external system interactions.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- The code functions solely as a type annotation utility for Strawberry GraphQL resolvers.\n\n**Scores & Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (No malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (Code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (No security risks identified)\n\n**Potential Discrepancies & Recommendations:**\n- The reports assign very low or zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), aligning with the clear, benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign utility for type annotations in Strawberry GraphQL schemas.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n- The documentation and usage examples reinforce the benign intent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. It is a safe, standard pattern for type annotations in Strawberry GraphQL resolver functions.",
