  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports from `typing` and defines a class `StrawberryParent`.\n- Creates a `TypeVar` named `T`.\n- Defines `Parent` as an `Annotated[T, StrawberryParent()]`.\n- Provides an extensive docstring with usage examples for Strawberry GraphQL resolvers.\n- No actual logic, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is straightforward and primarily defines type annotations and documentation.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The code aligns with standard practices for type annotations in Strawberry GraphQL.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- None identified. The code appears correct, well-documented, and intended for type hinting.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which is consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk:** 0, as no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- All reports assign a risk of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The code is purely for type annotation and documentation, with no potential for malicious activity.\n\n### Potential issues based on assumptions:\n- No assumptions are made about the code's behavior beyond its explicit content.\n- The class `StrawberryParent` is a placeholder; if it were malicious, it would be evident, but it appears benign.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign utility for Strawberry GraphQL schema type annotations, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports correctly identify the code as a straightforward type annotation setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the current scores reflect that accurately.",
