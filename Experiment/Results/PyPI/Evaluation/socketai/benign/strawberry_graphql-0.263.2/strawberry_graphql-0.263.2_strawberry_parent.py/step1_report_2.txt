{
  "purpose": "Define a type variable and an annotated type for use with Strawberry GraphQL resolvers to reference parent resolver data.",
  "sources": "Code imports (typing, Strawberry), class definition (StrawberryParent), TypeVar creation, Annotated type definition, code comments and example usage.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted input or write data to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is primarily defining types and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be straightforward type annotations and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary typing and Strawberry modules, defines a placeholder class StrawberryParent, creates a type variable T, and then defines an Annotated type Parent for use in resolver functions. The comments include a detailed usage example illustrating how to use the Parent annotation within Strawberry's framework. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious behavior. The code is purely for type hinting and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for Strawberry GraphQL resolver type annotations. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The code is well-structured, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
