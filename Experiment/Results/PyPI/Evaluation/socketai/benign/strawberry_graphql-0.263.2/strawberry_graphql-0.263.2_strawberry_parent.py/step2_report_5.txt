  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Obfuscation:**  \n   All reports consistently state that the code is straightforward, primarily defining type annotations and documentation for Strawberry GraphQL resolvers. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, network operations, or malicious payloads. The class `StrawberryParent` is an empty marker class, serving as a type indicator, which is common in such contexts.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code's purpose is to facilitate type safety in resolver functions. The usage example is standard and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code. No logical flaws or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.  \n   - **Risk Score:** All are 0, as there are no security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**  \n   The code is purely for type annotation and documentation. It does not process untrusted data, perform external calls, or handle sensitive information. The reports correctly dismiss any potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency and Justification:**  \n   The reports are consistent and justified. They correctly interpret the code's purpose, scope, and safety.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign utility for type annotations within Strawberry GraphQL schemas, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is safe, standard, and intended solely for type hinting and documentation. No adjustments needed based on the provided reports.",
