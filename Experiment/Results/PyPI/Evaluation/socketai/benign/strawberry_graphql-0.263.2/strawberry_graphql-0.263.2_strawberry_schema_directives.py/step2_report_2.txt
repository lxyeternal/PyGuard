  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; code is a simple class definition with a decorator.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; the class is a placeholder with no logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The confidence is high (1). The assessment aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or security risk, just a schema directive marker.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; similar to report 1.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Confidence is high.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior; just schema extension.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; the class is a placeholder with no logic.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Confidence is high.\n- **Justification:** Straightforward schema directive, no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; the class is a placeholder with an ellipsis.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Confidence is high.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, just incomplete code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; similar to others.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Confidence slightly lower (0.9).\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior; the slight security risk score might reflect minimal concern about placeholder code or potential future misuse, but given the current code, this is likely overestimating.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very low, as the code is benign but acknowledging the placeholder nature slightly increases uncertainty)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard pattern for defining a custom GraphQL schema directive.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The slight variation in confidence and risk scores in report 5 is acceptable but could be standardized to 1 and 0, respectively, given the benign nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores.\n- The code poses no security risks based on the provided snippet.",
