  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code and the reasoning behind their assessments.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code simply imports components from the 'strawberry.schema_directive' library.\n- Defines an empty class 'OneOf' decorated as a schema directive applicable to input objects.\n- The class contains only an ellipsis ('...'), indicating a placeholder or marker.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, or external inputs are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The code appears to be a minimal, standard schema extension for Strawberry GraphQL.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and concerns:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and typical for defining schema directives.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No significant errors. The only minor point is the use of '...' which suggests incomplete implementation but not malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware: 0 across all reports, which is consistent.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, also consistent.\n  - Security risk: mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1, likely due to the placeholder nature ('...') indicating incomplete code but not a security issue.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, straightforward schema extension.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Conclusion:** Same as above, no issues.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Conclusion:** Similar, noting the placeholder ('...') but no malicious intent.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Conclusion:** Same as above, minimal and safe code.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Conclusion:** Slightly higher uncertainty, with confidence 0.9 and securityRisk 0.1, citing the placeholder as a minor concern.  \n- **Score justification:** Given the code's simplicity, malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seems reasonable, though perhaps slightly overcautious.  \n- **Verdict:** The risk score could be slightly lowered to 0, as the placeholder is not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All zero, as no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All zero, code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 for all, given the code's benign nature, except possibly report 5 which assigned 0.1. I would recommend lowering that to 0 for consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are consistent; all identify the code as a standard, harmless schema directive.\n- The use of '...' is typical for placeholders, not malicious obfuscation.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the code is declarative and static.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Overall, I conclude that the code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation. The risk scores should be zero across all reports.**",
