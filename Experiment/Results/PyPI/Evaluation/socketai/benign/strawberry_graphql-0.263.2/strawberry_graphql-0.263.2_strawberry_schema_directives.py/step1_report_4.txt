{
  "purpose": "This code defines a GraphQL schema directive called 'OneOf' using the 'strawberry' library, likely for schema validation or customization purposes.",
  "sources": "Import from 'strawberry.schema_directive', specifically 'Location' and 'schema_directive'. No external or user input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs; the code solely defines a class and imports, with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The class 'OneOf' is defined with ellipsis, indicating incomplete or placeholder code. No malicious or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from a third-party library and defines an empty class decorated as a schema directive. There is no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns. The use of ellipsis suggests incomplete implementation but is not malicious. The import and class definition are straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple schema directive declaration with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a template or placeholder for further development. No malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
