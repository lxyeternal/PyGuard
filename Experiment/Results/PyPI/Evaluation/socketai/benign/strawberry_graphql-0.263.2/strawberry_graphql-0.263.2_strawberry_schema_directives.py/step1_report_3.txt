  "purpose": "Define a custom schema directive named 'oneOf' for use with Strawberry GraphQL schemas.",
  "sources": "Importing Location and schema_directive from strawberry.schema_directive",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data outputs or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input to sensitive sinks; the code solely defines a class and imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary components from a well-known library, defines a class decorated with a schema directive indicating it applies to input objects, and sets the module's export. There are no dynamic code execution, data handling, or suspicious constructs. The class is a placeholder (empty with '...') and the code does not perform any runtime actions or data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward definition of a custom schema directive with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malware-related activity.",
