  "purpose": "Define a GraphQL schema directive called 'oneOf' using the strawberry library.",
  "sources": "Import statement from strawberry.schema_directive; class decorator usage",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the class is a placeholder with no logic",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; the code appears straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from the 'strawberry.schema_directive' package and defines a class 'OneOf' decorated as a schema directive for GraphQL inputs. The class contains no internal logic or code that could be malicious. The import and decorator are typical for schema definition in Python GraphQL servers. No external data handling, no code injection, no suspicious patterns detected. The code is minimal and follows standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard schema directive definition for a GraphQL API using strawberry; there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
