  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code is a minimal class decorated as a schema directive with no internal logic.\n- No signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's declarative nature.\n- No suspicious patterns or dynamic behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Highlights the placeholder nature ('...') in the class.\n- No malicious activity or data handling.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Notes the incomplete '...' and the straightforward, safe import and class definition.\n- No malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, with slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a minimal security risk score (0.1).\n- Emphasizes the standard nature of the code, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly conservative but reasonable; the minimal risk score is justified given the placeholder and minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple, declarative class defining a GraphQL schema directive.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** All reports agree on zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk scores:** All are zero or near-zero, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The only minor concern is the placeholder ('...') in the class, which suggests incomplete implementation but not malicious intent.\n- The slightly elevated risk score (0.1) in Report 5 is reasonable, considering the placeholder nature.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain at 0 or very close to it; 0.1 is acceptable for the placeholder but can be lowered to 0 for clarity.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, minimal GraphQL schema directive definition with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the assessments and the code's actual nature.",
