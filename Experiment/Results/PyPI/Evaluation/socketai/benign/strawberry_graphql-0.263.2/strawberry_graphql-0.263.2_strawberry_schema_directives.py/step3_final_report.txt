  "purpose": "Define a custom GraphQL schema directive 'oneOf' for input objects using Strawberry's schema_directive system.",
  "sources": "Import from 'strawberry.schema_directive'; class decorator application",
  "sinks": "None; static code with no data processing or external interactions",
  "flows": "Import -> Class decoration -> Registration as schema directive",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder '...' indicating incomplete implementation, but no malicious or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports schema directive components, defines a minimal class 'OneOf' decorated as a schema directive for input objects, with no internal logic or data handling. The placeholder '...' suggests incomplete code but not malicious intent. No dynamic code, network activity, or data leaks are present. All reports correctly identify the benign, declarative nature of the code, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, with minimal security risk scores. The confidence in benignity is high, and no anomalies or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal schema directive declaration with no malicious or security issues. The placeholder '...' does not introduce risk. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.",
