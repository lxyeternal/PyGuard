  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code simply imports components from the 'strawberry.schema_directive' library and defines an empty class 'OneOf' decorated as a schema directive.\n   - The class is a placeholder with no internal logic or data processing, serving as a marker or extension point for GraphQL schema customization.\n\n2. **Malicious Activity and Security Risks:**\n   - None of the reports identify any signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, data leaks, or dynamic execution.\n   - The code does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or include any suspicious patterns.\n   - The only minor anomaly noted is the use of '...' (ellipsis) inside the class, which indicates incomplete implementation but is not malicious.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Security risk scores are also low or zero, consistent with the code's nature.\n   - Confidence scores are high (mostly 1), reflecting agreement that the code is benign.\n   - The only slight deviation is report 5, which assigns a security risk of 0.1 and confidence 0.9, citing the code as standard but noting the placeholder nature.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward schema directive declaration with no malicious intent.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based solely on static code review.\n   - The use of '...' is noted as incomplete but not suspicious.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, no security risks, and high confidence in benignity.\n   - The minimal nature of the code and the lack of dynamic or external data handling support these assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, since the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be very low, around 0.0 to 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Justification:\nThe code is a standard, minimal schema directive definition without any suspicious features. The placeholder '...' suggests incomplete implementation but not malicious intent. The high confidence and zero malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.05 (to reflect the placeholder status but overall benign nature)\n\nThis assessment aligns with all the reports' findings and the code's static analysis.",
