  "purpose": "Define a custom schema directive 'oneOf' for use with Strawberry GraphQL schemas.",
  "sources": "Import from 'strawberry.schema_directive' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only declares a class with decorator metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from a third-party library and defines a class decorated as a schema directive. There are no input data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The class is named 'OneOf' and is registered as a schema directive for input objects. The code is minimal and appears to be a straightforward schema extension. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard schema directive declaration for Strawberry GraphQL and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
