{
  "purpose": "Define a custom schema directive 'OneOf' for use with Strawberry GraphQL schemas.",
  "sources": "Import from 'strawberry.schema_directive'. No external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code only defines a class with no data processing or flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The class is a placeholder with no implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a decorator and a location enumeration from a library, then defines a class 'OneOf' decorated as a schema directive applicable to input objects. The class is empty and serves as a marker or extension point. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or security risks. The code is minimal and appears to be a typical schema extension without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward schema directive definition with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be part of a schema extension for GraphQL, with no suspicious features.",
