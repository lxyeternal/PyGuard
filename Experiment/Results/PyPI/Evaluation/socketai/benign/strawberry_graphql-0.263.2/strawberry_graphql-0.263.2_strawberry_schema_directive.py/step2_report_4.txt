  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code's behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious activity, straightforward schema decoration.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code only attaches metadata to classes, with no external or network activity. The functions used (_wrap_dataclass, _get_fields) are internal or imported utilities, presumed safe.\n- **Verdict:** The malware and risk scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious behavior, standard schema decorator.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that the code only manipulates class attributes and metadata, with no external data flow or malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the safe, metadata-only nature of the code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Analysis:** The reasoning aligns with the code's operations—no network, no system calls, no obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—safe, static metadata decoration.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or behaviors. The code's purpose is clear, and no malicious activity is suggested.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar, with a slight mention of \"securityRisk\": 0.1, but still no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (slightly higher, but still negligible)\n- **Analysis:** The code only attaches metadata; no external or untrusted data handling is present.\n- **Verdict:** The slight increase in securityRisk score seems unnecessary; the code is static and safe. The malware score remains correctly at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is a straightforward decorator pattern for attaching schema directives. No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- **Scores justification:** The malware scores are all correctly at 0; the code does not perform any malicious actions. The securityRisk scores are minimal, reflecting the static, metadata-only nature.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a safe, standard implementation for schema metadata decoration within a GraphQL framework. All reports correctly assess the code as benign, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** No changes are necessary; the code and reports align well.",
