{
  "purpose": "This code defines decorators and data structures for schema directives in a GraphQL framework, specifically for Strawberry GraphQL. Its purpose is to enable attaching metadata and directives to Python classes used as GraphQL schema components.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, class attributes, and external imports. It also processes annotations and decorators, which are input points for user-defined classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data flows directly into system-critical functions or sensitive operations. The code does not handle network I/O, file I/O, or external system commands.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves attaching metadata to classes via decorators, which store directive information as class attributes. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code employs standard patterns for data class creation and decorator usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules for data handling and type annotations. It defines a class for schema directives with various properties, including locations and fields. The core function, 'schema_directive,' is a decorator factory that wraps a class, modifies it by adding a directive attribute, and returns it. It uses internal functions to process class fields and attach metadata. There is no evidence of malicious logic, hidden code, or external network activity. All functions perform expected tasks related to schema annotation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for schema directive decoration within a GraphQL framework. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The structure and logic are typical for such purposes, with no signs of sabotage or harmful intent.",
