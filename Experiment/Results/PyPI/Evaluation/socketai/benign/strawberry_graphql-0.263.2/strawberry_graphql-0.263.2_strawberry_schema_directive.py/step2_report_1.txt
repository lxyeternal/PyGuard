  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Clarifies that the code is for attaching schema directives metadata.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external data sources or sinks; data flows are internal metadata attachment.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: Straightforward data structures and decorator pattern; no malicious code.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no security risks.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, focusing on schema directives.\n- Analysis: Standard patterns, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, typical implementation.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, for schema decoration.\n- Analysis: No suspicious activity; standard metadata attachment.\n- Conclusion: No security concerns.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same general purpose.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Safe, schema decoration utility.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as others, for attaching schema metadata.\n- Analysis: No untrusted data handling, no network or system operations.\n- Anomalies: Very minor security risk score (0.1), but this is likely due to the nature of metadata decoration, which is inherently non-risky.\n- Confidence: Slightly lower (0.95), but still high.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — acceptable, given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Given that the code is purely for attaching metadata to classes for schema purposes, the risk should be minimal. The small risk score of 0.1 in Report 5 is acceptable, but even this is likely overestimating risk, as there are no dynamic or external operations.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious intent or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0 — the code is a straightforward schema decoration utility with no security implications.\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is a safe, standard implementation for schema directives in Strawberry GraphQL, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores given in the reports are appropriate, though the minimal risk score could be adjusted to zero for clarity.",
