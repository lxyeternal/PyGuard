  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines data structures and a decorator for attaching schema directives metadata. No suspicious activity, no external sinks, no malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The logic is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The report's conclusion that the code is benign is well-supported.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.5 (or lower). The report assigns 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard patterns, no external I/O, no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical schema decoration utility. No signs of malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.5 or less. The report assigns 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard schema annotation code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected. The code is safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.5 or less. The report assigns 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical schema decoration utility with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious or risky behavior evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.5 or less. The report assigns 0, which is justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard metadata attachment, no external or malicious activity. Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) due to conservative approach.\n- **Assessment:** The overall code is safe. The minor risk score seems to reflect cautiousness rather than actual risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1 (acceptable). The report's assigned scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward metadata decoration pattern.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign very low or zero, which is appropriate given the absence of external inputs, network activity, or system modifications.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks identified; the code is purely for schema metadata management.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe implementation for attaching schema directives in Strawberry GraphQL. It does not pose security threats, does not contain malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
