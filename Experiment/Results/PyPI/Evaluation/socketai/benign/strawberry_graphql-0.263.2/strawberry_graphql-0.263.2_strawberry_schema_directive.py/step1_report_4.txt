{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures and decorators for schema directives in a GraphQL framework, specifically for Strawberry GraphQL.",
  "sources": "Code reads class definitions, function parameters, and module imports. No external untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks such as network, file system, or environment variable usage are present.",
  "flows": "There are no untrusted data flows from source to sink; the code primarily manipulates class metadata and annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as obfuscated code, hidden dynamic execution, or hardcoded secrets. The code performs standard schema decoration tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries for data classes and GraphQL schema manipulation. It defines an Enum for schema locations, a dataclass for schema directives, and a decorator to attach directive metadata to classes. The decorator modifies class attributes to include directive metadata. No external data inputs or outputs are processed, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of schema directive decoration in a GraphQL Python framework. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and intended for schema metadata management.",
