  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward schema decoration utility for Strawberry GraphQL, attaching metadata via a decorator.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code patterns, no external network or file operations, no obfuscation, and no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0.  \n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard patterns for schema annotation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no external data handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0.  \n**Conclusion:** Consistent with the code. No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical schema decorator utility, with no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code execution, no secrets, no network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Standard schema decoration, no untrusted input or malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No obfuscation, no external I/O, safe pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with a note on no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** Slightly higher SecurityRisk score (0.1), but no evidence of actual risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Obfuscated=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Slightly elevated risk score may be an overestimation; no actual malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely for attaching metadata and does not perform any suspicious operations.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, standard Python with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any malicious or insecure behavior, the risk score should be very low or zero. The only minor concern is the default 0.1 in report 5, which seems unjustified.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (code is clear and standard)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall:** The code is a standard, safe implementation for schema metadata decoration in Strawberry GraphQL. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation present. The existing scores are appropriate, except for the minor overestimation in report 5 regarding security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- Confirmed no issues in the code.\n- No errors or flaws in logic.\n- Scores are reasonable; I suggest setting malware and obfuscated scores to zero, and risk score to zero as well.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown of any specific part.",
