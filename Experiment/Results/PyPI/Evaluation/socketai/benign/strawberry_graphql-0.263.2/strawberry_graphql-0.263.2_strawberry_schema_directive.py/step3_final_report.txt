  "purpose": "This code defines data structures and decorators for attaching schema directives metadata in Strawberry GraphQL, primarily for schema annotation and metadata management.",
  "sources": "Class definitions (__name__, __strawberry_directive__), decorator parameters, internal functions (_wrap_dataclass, _get_fields)",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or sinks; no network, file, or environment variable operations; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Decorator receives class and parameters, attaches metadata to class attributes, no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external I/O; straightforward use of Python features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for attaching schema directives via class decorators. It uses internal utility functions to process class fields and attaches metadata without external data handling or malicious code. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The code's purpose is purely metadata decoration, with no network or system impact.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for schema directive attachment in Strawberry GraphQL. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal security risk score observed in reports is an overestimation; the code is static and benign.",
