{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures and decorators for schema directives in a Strawberry GraphQL schema, primarily for organizing and annotating schema elements.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, function parameters, and imported modules; specifically, it reads class decorators, function arguments, and imported functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted input directly or perform operations like network communication, file writing, or system commands.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves defining data structures and a decorator that attaches metadata to classes. There are no external or network flows; data flows are limited to class attribute assignments within the Python runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious imports are present. The code strictly defines data structures and a decorator pattern for schema metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and external modules to define dataclasses, enums, and type transformations. It introduces a decorator 'schema_directive' that attaches a StrawberrySchemaDirective instance as metadata to classes, using internal functions like '_wrap_dataclass' and '_get_fields' to process class fields. All operations are within normal schema annotation patterns, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for schema metadata decoration, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate schema decoration utility for Strawberry GraphQL, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely attaches metadata to classes for schema generation purposes. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
