{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures and decorators for schema directives in a Strawberry GraphQL schema, mainly for schema customization and metadata annotation.",
  "sources": "Input data from decorator parameters (locations, description, name, etc.), class attributes, and imported modules/functions.",
  "sinks": "Assigning attributes to classes (__strawberry_directive__), calling imported functions (_wrap_dataclass, _get_fields), and creating instances of StrawberrySchemaDirective.",
  "flows": "Decorator parameters → _wrap class → attach metadata → store in class attribute.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network calls, no obfuscated code, and no unusual or malicious logic present. The code relies on external modules for processing, but does not perform any risky actions itself.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data class definitions, enum declarations, and a decorator function for attaching schema directives. It uses well-established Python patterns for class decoration and metadata assignment. The functions involved (_wrap_dataclass, _get_fields) are imported, and their behaviors are assumed standard. No dynamic code execution, external input parsing, or network activity is present. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads. Overall, it appears to be a straightforward implementation for schema annotation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears safe, serving as a schema annotation utility for Strawberry GraphQL. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a well-structured module intended for schema metadata management.",
