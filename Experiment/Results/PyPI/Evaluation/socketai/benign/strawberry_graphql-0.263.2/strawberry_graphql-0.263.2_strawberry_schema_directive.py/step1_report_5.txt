{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures and decorators for schema directives in a Strawberry GraphQL schema, allowing the annotation of classes with metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions and their fields, particularly in the schema_directive decorator which processes class types.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions with untrusted input; no data leaks or unsafe operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class definitions into the decorator, which attaches metadata, but there are no dangerous or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code uses standard Python features and type annotations without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Location enum for schema element types, a dataclass for schema directives, and a decorator factory for attaching schema directive metadata to classes. It uses standard library and strawberry-specific functions to process class fields and attach metadata. No external input processing, security-sensitive operations, or obfuscation are evident. The code performs static metadata attachment and does not perform network operations, system modifications, or secret handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical metadata decoration pattern for schema definitions and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe with no evidence of malware or vulnerabilities.",
