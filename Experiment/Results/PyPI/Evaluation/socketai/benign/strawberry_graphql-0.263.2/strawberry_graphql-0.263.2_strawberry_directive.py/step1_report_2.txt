{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of utilities for defining and handling GraphQL directives using the Strawberry library, including decorator functions, data classes, and type annotations.",
  "sources": "The code reads type annotations, function parameters, default values, and class attributes. It also accesses class properties and decorator arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the creation of StrawberryField and StrawberryDirective objects, which could process user-provided input in their parameters, especially in the decorator functions and class initializers.",
  "flows": "Input data from decorator arguments and function parameters flow into the creation of directive objects, including name, description, locations, and resolver functions. These are used to instantiate StrawberryDirective and StrawberryDirectiveResolver objects, which might process or store the data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code is largely straightforward, with standard use of decorators, dataclasses, and type annotations. The docstrings contain example code, but this is typical documentation and not executable malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions and classes for GraphQL directives, including a decorator for directive creation. It imports from well-known libraries and defines types, data classes, and functions with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. There are no network operations, file operations, or dynamic code execution that could be malicious. The code appears safe, standard, and intended solely for schema definition purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of GraphQL directive utilities using Strawberry, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, documented, and does not perform any suspicious actions. The risk of supply chain malware is low.",
