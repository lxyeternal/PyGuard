  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the accuracy of their assessments and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines utilities for GraphQL directives, imports standard modules, and creates functions/classes for directive metadata.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evident sinks where untrusted data is used directly; data flows are static metadata or function wrappers.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. The code is standard library utility code.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, well-structured, no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is purely utility, with no malicious behavior. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, utility functions/classes for directives.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Potentially the creation of directive objects from user input, but these are schema definitions, not runtime data processing.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation; straightforward.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity is evident. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, utilities for directives.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing; primarily code definitions.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, straightforward.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign, and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions and decorators for directives.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** User-defined functions are wrapped into directive objects; these could be invoked at runtime during GraphQL execution.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, but the fact that user functions are wrapped and potentially invoked at runtime warrants noting. However, this is standard behavior for schema directives.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with high confidence.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly notes that user functions could be invoked at runtime, but this is normal for directives. No malicious intent is evident. The security risk is minimal; the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility code with decorator functions.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** User functions passed into decorators could be invoked later, but this is expected behavior.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign, and the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final thoughts:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is utility/schema definition code, not executing untrusted data or malicious actions.\n- The main potential concern is the invocation of user-provided functions at runtime, but this is typical for schema directives and does not indicate malicious intent.\n- The malware scores are all appropriately zero; no malicious code or backdoors are present.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, inherent to the possibility of runtime invocation of user functions, but standard for such schema utilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe implementation of GraphQL directive utilities within the Strawberry framework. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.",
