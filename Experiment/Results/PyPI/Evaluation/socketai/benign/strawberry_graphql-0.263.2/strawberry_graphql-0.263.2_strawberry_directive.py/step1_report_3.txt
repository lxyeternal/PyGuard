{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for defining GraphQL directives within a Python schema using the Strawberry library, including decorators and metadata handling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; primarily code definitions and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data outputs, network communication, or data leakage points observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; no flow of untrusted data to sensitive operations detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code follows standard patterns for decorators and type annotations. No unusual or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions, classes, and decorators for GraphQL directives in Python. It uses standard library features, type annotations, and Strawberry-specific classes. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection. The functions are purely declarative and do not perform any side-effects or sensitive operations. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, safe implementation of GraphQL directive utilities for Strawberry. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a straightforward application of type annotations, decorators, and data classes for schema metadata.",
