{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators and classes for defining GraphQL directives in Strawberry, a Python GraphQL library.",
  "sources": "Import statements, function parameters, class attributes, and decorator functions that accept input data (e.g., 'name', 'locations', 'description', 'f').",
  "sinks": "Return statements creating StrawberryField objects, StrawberryDirective instances, and calling user-provided functions (e.g., 'f') within the decorator, which could potentially execute untrusted code or modify data flow.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., 'name', 'locations', 'description', 'f') flow into class instantiations and decorator wrappers; user functions passed to the decorator are wrapped into StrawberryDirective objects, which may invoke user-defined functions during directive resolution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets. Use of standard typing, dataclasses, and Strawberry library components appears normal. No evidence of obfuscated code, hidden network calls, or malicious system access. No dynamic code execution or unsafe handling of untrusted input detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions and classes to create GraphQL directives using Strawberry, including a decorator for user-defined functions. It primarily manages metadata and wiring for directives. No dangerous system calls, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. Inputs are typical configuration parameters, and data flows into class constructors and user-provided functions without apparent malicious manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of GraphQL directive helpers for Strawberry, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It handles user data and function decorators in a safe and conventional manner.",
