{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for defining and handling GraphQL directives within the Strawberry framework, including decorator functions, data classes, and type annotations for directive metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules such as 'graphql', 'strawberry.types', and standard Python libraries; no untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Creation of directive objects and metadata, which are static configurations; no untrusted data is processed at runtime in a dangerous manner.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters flow into class constructors and decorator functions to produce directive metadata objects; no dynamic or untrusted data flows into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code constructs are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for schema directives, including a decorator for creating directives, data classes for directive metadata, and type annotations. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute user-provided code beyond standard decorator wrapping. The functions and classes are static and intended for schema configuration. The potential for runtime invocation of user functions is standard in schema directives and does not imply malicious intent. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, utility-focused implementation for GraphQL directive management within the Strawberry framework. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and poses minimal security risk. The assigned scores accurately reflect its safety profile.",
