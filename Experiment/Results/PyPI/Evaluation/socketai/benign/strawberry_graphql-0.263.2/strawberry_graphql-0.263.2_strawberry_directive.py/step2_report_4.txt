  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes utilities for GraphQL directives; sources are external modules and type hints.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evident sinks; no untrusted data flows into dangerous operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard utility for schema definition, with no malicious behavior. The confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0, and security risk is minimal (0.1).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions; reads from parameters and class attributes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Potentially creates objects that process input, but these are schema metadata, not runtime data from untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; documentation examples are benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard code for schema utilities. Malware score is 0, confidence high (0.9), low security risk.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines utilities for directives; no external data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows from untrusted sources; no network or file I/O.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code constructs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation. Malware score 0, high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar schema utility functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous runtime behavior; user functions are wrapped but not executed maliciously.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, safe code. Malware score 0, confidence 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for directives; parameters used for configuration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** User functions are wrapped but not executed at this stage; no malicious code.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, safe implementation. Malware score 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, and the code is purely schema utility code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any suspicious behavior, the risk score should be very low, consistent with the reports' assessments.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or possibly even 0, given the benign nature, but keeping minimal for schema utility context)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a straightforward implementation of GraphQL directive utilities within the Strawberry framework. It is free from malicious logic, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and I concur with their assessments.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis indicates a benign, well-structured, and safe codebase with no supply chain security concerns.",
