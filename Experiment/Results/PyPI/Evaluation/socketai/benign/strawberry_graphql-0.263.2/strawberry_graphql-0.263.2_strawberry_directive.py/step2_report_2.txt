  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the potential for malicious activity, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is utility functions/classes for GraphQL directives, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.1\n\n**Assessment**: The code is purely declarative, defining decorators, data classes, and utility functions for schema metadata. No dynamic code execution, no external data, no network activity. The malware score is appropriate at 0. The security risk is minimal, given no untrusted data handling. The overall conclusion aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on no suspicious code, no external data sources, and standard patterns.\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.1\n\n**Assessment**: The analysis is consistent. The code is for schema metadata, no malicious behavior detected. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, utility code for directives, no evident sinks or malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.1\n\n**Assessment**: The code remains benign. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Focuses on the decorator wrapping user functions, but still no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Assessment**: The only potential concern is that user functions are wrapped and stored, which could, in theory, be invoked during runtime. However, in the context of schema definition, this is standard practice, and no code suggests malicious behavior. The malware score remains at 0, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to previous, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.1\n\n**Assessment**: Consistent with prior assessments. The code is schema utility, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware scores**: All are appropriately set at 0. The code is utility and metadata-focused, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores**: All are 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores**: Slightly above zero (0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk in schema definition code, which is acceptable.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.1\n\nThe code appears safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
