  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, data flows, potential vulnerabilities, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines utilities for GraphQL directives, imports well-known libraries, and creates classes/functions for metadata management.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks; the code primarily handles static metadata and decorators.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious logic. It’s a standard schema utility implementation.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears benign, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, risk is minimal.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** No  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (appropriate)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (appropriate, given the utility nature)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility code, with focus on decorators and classes for directives.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Potential sinks include creation of directive objects with user inputs. However, these are schema definitions, not execution points.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no code injection, no network or file I/O. The data flows are from configuration parameters to class instances.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is safe, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score remains 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (consistent)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, utilities for GraphQL directives, no external data sources.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flows into sensitive operations; primarily configuration.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns. The code is straightforward.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, high confidence (0.95). Malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, decorators, and classes.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** User functions passed to decorators could be invoked later, but this is standard for schema definitions and not inherently malicious.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation. The code is schema metadata-focused.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, very high confidence (1). Malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—utilities for directives, with user functions wrapped in decorators.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** User functions could be invoked at runtime, but this is normal in schema execution. No evidence of malicious code execution or data leakage.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code is consistent across reports:** All are utility functions for schema directives, with no evidence of malicious activity.  \n- **Malware scores:** All appropriately set to 0, as no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.  \n- **Obfuscated scores:** Correctly 0, given the code clarity.  \n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) to reflect the potential for user-provided functions to be invoked, but this is standard and not inherently risky in schema definition code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (appropriate, given the potential for user-defined functions to be invoked at runtime, but not malicious)\n\n**In conclusion,** the reports are accurate, and the code appears safe. No changes to scores are necessary. The code is a standard, benign implementation of GraphQL directive utilities within the Strawberry framework, with no malware or malicious intent detected.",
