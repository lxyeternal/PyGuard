{
  "purpose": "The code defines utilities for creating and handling GraphQL directives within the Strawberry GraphQL Python library, including decorators, classes, and functions to facilitate directive creation and metadata management.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules such as 'graphql', 'strawberry.types.field', 'strawberry.types.fields.resolver', 'strawberry.types.unset', and type hints; defines functions 'directive_field' and 'directive'; creates classes 'StrawberryDirectiveValue', 'StrawberryDirectiveResolver', and 'StrawberryDirective'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used directly; no code executes external commands, writes files, or handles untrusted input in a dangerous manner.",
  "flows": "The functions and classes create metadata and decorators for GraphQL directives; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as data is primarily static metadata or function wrappers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious logic; code appears to be standard library utility functions for schema definition.",
  "analysis": "The code implements structured utilities for defining GraphQL directives, including metadata handling and decorators. It uses standard Python features such as dataclasses, typing, and function decorators. No network, file I/O, or untrusted data processing is present. The code does not perform any dynamic execution, code injection, or access sensitive data. It is part of a schema definition library, with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of GraphQL directive utilities within the Strawberry framework. It appears to be benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware indicators are identified.",
