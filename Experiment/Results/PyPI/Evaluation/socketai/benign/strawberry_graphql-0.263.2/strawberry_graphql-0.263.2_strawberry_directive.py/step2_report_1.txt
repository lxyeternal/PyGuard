  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the validity of their conclusions, and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines utilities for GraphQL directives, importing from Strawberry and graphql modules. No suspicious sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; mainly static metadata and decorator functions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears to be standard utility functions for schema definition, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior. The low security risk score seems appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, the code provides utilities for directives, with standard imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The creation of directive objects from user inputs could be considered a point where untrusted data flows into schema metadata, but these are static or controlled.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward utility, with no malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's benign nature. The low malware and risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, no external untrusted data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous data flow; the code only defines schema utilities.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and intended for schema definition.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as safe; the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines utilities and decorators for directives.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** User-defined functions passed to decorators could be invoked later, but this is expected behavior for schema resolvers.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical schema utility with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Very thorough and confident assessment; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, no external untrusted data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** User functions wrapped in decorators; potential for code execution if user functions are malicious, but the code itself does not execute user functions directly.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard helper for directives, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code present. The code is purely schema metadata and decorator utilities.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The scores are low (around 0.1), reflecting minimal security concern. Given the code's purpose and lack of dangerous operations, this is justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, as the code is utility-focused and does not process untrusted data in a dangerous way.\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe reports are consistent and justified. The code appears to be a benign part of the Strawberry GraphQL library, with no security risks or malware indicators.",
