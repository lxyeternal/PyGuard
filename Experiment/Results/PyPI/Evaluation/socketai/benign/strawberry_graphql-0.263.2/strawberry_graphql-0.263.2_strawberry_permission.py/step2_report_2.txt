  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code to verify claims, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the code as a permission system with base classes, directive handling, and support for sync/async. Finds no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis Validity:** The code indeed defines a permission framework, with methods for permission checks, error handling, and directive application. No external data sources or network calls are present. The use of `await_maybe` and standard Python features supports the claim of straightforward, safe logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0 aligns with the absence of malicious activity. Security risk 0.1 is low, considering the permission checks and error handling are standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. The code appears benign and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of permission checks, error handling, and directive management. No malicious patterns or external threats detected.\n- **Analysis Validity:** The code's flow from permission checks to errors or silent fallback is typical. No external data leaks or suspicious code patterns. Use of `await_maybe` supports async handling without introducing malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0 is justified. Security risk 0.2 is reasonable given the potential for silent failures if misused, but overall low.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct. No malicious activity or security issues evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard design of permission classes, directive application, and error handling. Finds no suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis Validity:** The code's logic is consistent with typical permission systems. No external dependencies or network activity. Use of exception raising and directive appending is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0 is appropriate. Security risk remains low.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. The code is a legitimate permission extension.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the straightforward permission checks, error handling, and directive management. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis Validity:** The flow from permission evaluation to error or silent fallback is conventional. No obfuscation or suspicious code. Use of `await_maybe` is standard for async support.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0 is justified. Security risk is low.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing the correct handling of permission checks, directive application, and silent failure modes. No malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis Validity:** The code's structure and flow are typical. No external data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0 is appropriate. Security risk is minimal.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. The code appears safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is consistent with the code's content—no malicious logic, no external data exfiltration, no backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0, and the code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard Python patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** The highest noted is 0.2, which is reasonable given the permission framework's potential misuse if permissions are misconfigured, but no inherent vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0.1–0.2** — Low, primarily related to silent failure modes if permissions are misused, but no active vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-implemented permission system for a GraphQL schema extension. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Recommendation:**  \nThe overall security posture based on this review is very high; no immediate concerns or threats are identified. The permission framework appears safe, with proper handling of errors and async support.",
