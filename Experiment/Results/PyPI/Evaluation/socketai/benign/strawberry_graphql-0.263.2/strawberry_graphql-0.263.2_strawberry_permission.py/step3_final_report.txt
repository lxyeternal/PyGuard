{
  "purpose": "Provides a permission framework with base classes and schema directives for GraphQL fields, enabling permission checks and error handling.",
  "sources": "Permission check methods ('has_permission'), error raising in 'on_unauthorized', directive application in 'apply'.",
  "sinks": "Error raising via 'raise error', silent fallback returning None or empty list, appending directives to schema fields.",
  "flows": "Permission checks flow from 'resolve' methods through 'has_permission' to 'on_unauthorized' or next resolver; directive application modifies schema fields.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data leaks detected. Uses standard patterns; no malicious or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a permission system with base classes and a field extension, supporting both sync and async permission checks. It manages schema directives and error handling in a standard, transparent manner. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious patterns are present. Silent failure modes are documented and controlled. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses common Python practices. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented permission system for Strawberry GraphQL. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), primarily due to silent failure modes that could be misused if permissions are misconfigured. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
