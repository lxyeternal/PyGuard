  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented permission system for Strawberry GraphQL. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), primarily due to silent failure modes that could be misused if permissions are misconfigured. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
