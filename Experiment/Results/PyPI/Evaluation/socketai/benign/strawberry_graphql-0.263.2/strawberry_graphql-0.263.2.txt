      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate part of Strawberry's type handling system. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only potential risk stems from evaluating string annotations with 'eval_type', which should be trusted within the framework's context. Overall, it is safe and appropriate for its purpose."

The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), primarily due to silent failure modes that could be misused if permissions are misconfigured. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."

      "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is effectively zero. The main concern for security would be the behavior of the 'run()' function in 'cli', which cannot be assessed here. Overall, the code appears safe and typical for a Python CLI application."
