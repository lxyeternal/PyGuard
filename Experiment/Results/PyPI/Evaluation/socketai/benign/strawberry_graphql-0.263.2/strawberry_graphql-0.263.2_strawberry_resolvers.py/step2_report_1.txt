  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines a single function `is_default_resolver` that checks whether a given function object has an attribute `_is_default` set to True.\n- It uses `getattr` for attribute inspection.\n- The module exports this function via `__all__`.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external I/O, network activity, or data manipulation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code is simple and performs a benign attribute check.\n- **Malicious activity:** No, none of the reports suggest any malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risks:** None, except perhaps very minimal, which is acknowledged as security risk 0.1 in one report, but this is negligible given the code's nature.\n\n### Critical review of scores:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0, one 0.1), consistent with the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the code's clarity.\n- Confidence levels are 1 across reports, which seems justified given the simplicity.\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning issues:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as a benign utility function.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; all assessments are cautious and reasonable.\n- The purpose of the function (checking an attribute) is standard in plugin or resolver mechanisms.\n\n### Potential improvements:\n- No changes needed; the reports are thorough and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — the code poses no security threat.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a simple attribute check utility, common in plugin systems.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe overall scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated, with a security risk of zero, reflecting the benign nature of this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is safe, with no security issues.\n- The scores should be: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0**.\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's benign nature and the appropriateness of the current scoring.",
