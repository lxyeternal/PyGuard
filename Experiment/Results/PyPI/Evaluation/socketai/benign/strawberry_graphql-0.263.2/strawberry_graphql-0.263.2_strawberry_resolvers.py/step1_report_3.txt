{
  "purpose": "Define a utility function to check if a given resolver function is marked as default.",
  "sources": "The function `is_default_resolver` reads the attribute `_is_default` from the input function `func`.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any critical operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameter `func` is checked for an attribute; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sinks occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining a single function that uses `getattr` to check for a specific attribute on the input callable. The `__all__` list exports this function. There are no external inputs, no file I/O, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The purpose appears to be for internal metadata checking. No obfuscated code, no backdoors, and no suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function with no malicious intent or security issues. It performs a basic attribute check on a provided callable object, likely used for internal logic. No security risks or malware are present.",
