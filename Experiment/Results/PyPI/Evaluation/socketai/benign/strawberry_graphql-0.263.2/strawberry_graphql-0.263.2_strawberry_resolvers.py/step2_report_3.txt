  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple utility function that checks for an attribute `_is_default` on a provided function object.\n- They agree that the code is straightforward, uses standard Python introspection (`getattr`), and does not perform any I/O, network activity, or data manipulation.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are very low or zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain any errors, flaws, or mistakes.\n- The logic is simple and correct.\n- The attribute `_is_default` is checked via `getattr`, which is standard practice.\n- The code does not read or write external data, nor does it execute dynamic code or obfuscate logic.\n\n### Scores:\n- The **malware** scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The **obfuscated** scores are 0, which is consistent.\n- The **securityRisk** scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1, which is appropriate.\n- The code's purpose is internal attribute checking, with no malicious implications.\n\n### Potential issues or inconsistencies:\n- The reports are consistent; no discrepancies in reasoning or scoring.\n- The overall assessment aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly because it is a utility function; however, even this is very low, reflecting no security concern.\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the code's simplicity and the reports' consensus, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 to 0.1 (very low, as it’s just a utility function with no security implications)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores provided in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
