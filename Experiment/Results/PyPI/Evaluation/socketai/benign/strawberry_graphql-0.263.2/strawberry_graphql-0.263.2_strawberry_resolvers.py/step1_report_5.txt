{
  "purpose": "Define a utility function to check if a given function is marked as a default resolver based on a specific attribute.",
  "sources": "The 'func' parameter in the 'is_default_resolver' function, which is a Callable object passed at runtime.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in the code; the function only reads an attribute from a Callable object without executing or modifying external data.",
  "flows": "The code reads an attribute '_is_default' from the 'func' object and returns its boolean value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward; it only inspects an attribute. There is no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary typing modules, defines a simple function to check for a specific attribute '_is_default' on a passed-in callable, and exposes this function via __all__. It performs a standard attribute check with 'getattr'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leaks, or backdoors. The function is simple and does not interact with external systems, network, or environment variables.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility function for attribute inspection with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard, with no evidence of obfuscation or malware.",
