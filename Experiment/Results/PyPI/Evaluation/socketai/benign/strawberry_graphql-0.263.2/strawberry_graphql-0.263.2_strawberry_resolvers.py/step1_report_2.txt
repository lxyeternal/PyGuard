{
  "purpose": "The code defines a utility function to check if a given function is a default resolver, likely used for plugin or callback identification.",
  "sources": "The code reads the function object passed as an argument to 'is_default_resolver'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Input function object -> 'getattr' call to check '_is_default' attribute -> Boolean return.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing for type annotations, defines a function to check an attribute on a function object, and exports this function via __all__. It does not perform any I/O, network activity, or unsafe operations. The function only inspects attributes of a function, which is typical for plugin or resolver mechanisms. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The code appears clean, simple, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for attribute checking on functions with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs a straightforward attribute check without any malicious implications.",
