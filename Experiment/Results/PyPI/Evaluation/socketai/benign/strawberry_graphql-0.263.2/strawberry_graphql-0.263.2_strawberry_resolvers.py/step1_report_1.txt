  "purpose": "The code defines a utility function to check if a given resolver function is marked as default.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or data reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely functional with no data manipulation or transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing module, defines a simple function that uses 'getattr' to check for a specific attribute '_is_default' on the provided function. The attribute check is straightforward and standard, with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behavior. The '__all__' declaration specifies exports for module clarity. Overall, the code is simple, clear, and contains no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign attribute check to identify default resolver functions, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
