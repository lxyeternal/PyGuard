  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward utility function that checks for an attribute `_is_default` on a provided function object.\n- The code imports `typing`, defines the function `is_default_resolver`, and exposes it via `__all__`.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are identified.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The consensus is that the code is benign, simple, and safe.\n\n**Assessment of Security and Malware Risks:**\n\n- The code performs a basic attribute check using `getattr`, which is a standard Python introspection method.\n- There are no signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, network access, or data leaks.\n- The attribute `_is_default` appears to be a marker attribute, possibly used internally to identify default resolvers, not an indicator of malicious intent.\n- The security risk scores assigned are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature, there are no logical flaws or security concerns.\n- The only minor point is that the function relies on the presence of the `_is_default` attribute, which depends on external code setting this attribute appropriately. However, this is a common pattern in Python and not inherently risky.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (0 or 0.1), justified by the code's simplicity and benign purpose.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports seem reasonable and consistent.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n- The overall assessment is that this code is safe, with no security risks or malware concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily because it inspects attributes, which is standard practice.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign utility function with no security or malware issues. The scores in the reports are appropriate and should be maintained.",
