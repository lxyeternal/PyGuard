  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward utility function that checks for an attribute `_is_default` on a function object.\n- All reports agree that the code is simple, benign, and free of malicious behavior.\n- The code does not perform any I/O, network activity, or data manipulation beyond attribute inspection.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly uses `getattr` to check for `_is_default`. The logic is sound.\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify any issues in the code.\n- **Malware or security risks:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports note no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign a very low or zero security risk score, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct.\n- **Risk score:** The risk score is consistently 0 or very close to it (0.1 in report 2). Given the code's simplicity and benign intent, a risk score of 0.0 is justified.\n\n### Validity of reasoning:\n\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the code is just an attribute check.\n- The reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- The purpose appears to be for internal metadata or plugin management, which is common and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the assessments that:\n\n- The code is benign.\n- No malware or obfuscation is present.\n- The security risk is negligible.\n\n**My suggested scores:**\n\n| Metric             | Score |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| malware            | 0.0    |\n| obfuscated         | 0.0    |\n| securityRisk       | 0.0    |\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a simple, safe utility function with no security concerns. The reports' scores are reasonable and align with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
