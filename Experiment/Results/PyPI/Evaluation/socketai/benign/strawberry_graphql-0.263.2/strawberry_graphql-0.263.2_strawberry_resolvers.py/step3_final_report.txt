  "purpose": "Check whether a given function is a default resolver by inspecting its '_is_default' attribute.",
  "sources": "The function 'is_default_resolver' reads the '_is_default' attribute from the input function object using 'getattr'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input function -> 'getattr' check for '_is_default' attribute -> return boolean result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward attribute check with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple utility function that inspects a function object for a specific attribute. It uses standard Python introspection ('getattr') without external I/O, network activity, or data manipulation. The attribute '_is_default' appears to be a marker, likely set elsewhere in the codebase. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The code is clear, concise, and performs a benign check. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (~0.1). The overall assessment aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function used for attribute inspection, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk≈0 are appropriate and should be maintained.",
