  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple utility function that checks for an attribute `_is_default` on a function object.\n- They consistently state that the code is straightforward, uses standard Python introspection (`getattr`), and does not perform any I/O, network, or malicious activity.\n- The confidence levels are all high (1), and there are no indications of obfuscation or malware.\n\n**Confirming code issues:**\n- The code matches the descriptions in all reports. There are no discrepancies, and no issues are reported or implied beyond the benign attribute check.\n- No signs of vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or obfuscation are present.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1. Since the code is benign, a score of 0 is justified.\n- **Risk score:** All reports give 0 or very close to 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n\n**Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- No issues warrant a high risk score. The code is a simple attribute check, with no malicious or dangerous behavior.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports assume the code is safe based on static analysis. Given the simplicity and lack of external interactions, this is reasonable.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis correctly states the benign nature.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign utility function with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nNo changes needed; all scores and conclusions are appropriate.",
