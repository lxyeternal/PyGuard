{
  "purpose": "Define a utility function to check if a given resolver function is a default resolver based on a specific attribute.",
  "sources": "The function accesses the 'func' argument and retrieves the '_is_default' attribute using getattr.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O or external interactions.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: input 'func' -> getattr to retrieve '_is_default' -> return boolean.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is simple, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns. No obfuscation or malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that checks for an attribute '_is_default' on the provided function object. It uses standard Python introspection without dynamic code execution or external interactions. The __all__ variable specifies exported symbols, typical for modules intended for reuse. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network access, data leakage, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as a utility to identify default resolvers. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
