  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the risk assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles type annotations, with no malicious behavior detected. It involves evaluation via `eval_type`, caching, and type creation.\n- **Assessment:** No issues found; the code is standard for schema handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.5 (due to evaluation of string annotations, but considered safe here).\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; no suspicious activity. The risk score could be slightly lower (e.g., 0.2), but 0.5 is acceptable given the potential evaluation risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on `eval_type` usage. The reviewer notes that `eval_type` could be risky if compromised but assumes it’s safe.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; reliance on `eval_type` is standard but warrants trust.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 (due to reliance on dynamic evaluation).\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is consistent. The risk score is reasonable; no malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, similar evaluation, with focus on `eval_type`. No malicious code detected.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity; the code is typical for type resolution.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. The low risk score reflects the evaluation of dynamic annotations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar analysis, with emphasis on dynamic evaluation via `eval_type`. No malicious behavior found.\n- **Assessment:** The use of `sys.modules` for namespace is standard; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is solid; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focus on evaluation and namespace setting. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Assessment:** The main concern is the use of `eval_type` on potentially untrusted annotations, but it is assumed to be safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the previous reports; the low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, indicating no malicious activity. The code is standard for a schema library.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is clear and structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0.2, citing the potential danger of evaluating string annotations with `eval_type`. This is a reasonable assessment, assuming `eval_type` is a controlled utility.\n\n### My Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — primarily due to dynamic evaluation of annotations, which is standard but should be trusted.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a typical implementation of a type annotation resolver within a GraphQL schema framework. It relies on `eval_type` to evaluate string annotations, which could be risky if `eval_type` is compromised, but this is an accepted pattern in such libraries. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a deeper review of specific parts or further clarification.",
