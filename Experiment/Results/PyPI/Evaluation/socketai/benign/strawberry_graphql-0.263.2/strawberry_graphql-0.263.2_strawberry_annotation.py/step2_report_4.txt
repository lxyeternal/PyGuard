  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a core part of Strawberry's type handling, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malware, no external system calls, no untrusted input execution. The evaluation via `eval_type` is standard for such frameworks.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.5 (moderate, due to dynamic eval but within expected bounds).\n- **Justification:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. The only potential concern is `eval_type`, but it's a controlled utility.\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on `eval_type` and dynamic annotation evaluation.\n- **Analysis:** The main concern is the use of `eval_type`, which could be risky if compromised, but in context, it's standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2 (low), Obfuscated=0.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the evaluation process, especially `eval_type`.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, just type resolution. The reliance on `eval_type` is noted but considered safe if `eval_type` is trustworthy.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.\n- **Justification:** Reasonable; no malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar focus, highlighting `eval_type` and module inspection.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, standard schema handling. The only potential concern is `eval_type` evaluation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, Obfuscated=0.\n- **Justification:** Valid; no malware detected.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with emphasis on dynamic evaluation and module access.\n- **Analysis:** The main risk is `eval_type` on potentially untrusted input, but in context, it's part of schema processing.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.\n- **Justification:** Reasonable; no malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malware activity. The code does not perform network, file, or system modifications.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is evident; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2-0.5) in some reports due to dynamic evaluation (`eval_type`), which is standard in such frameworks but should be noted as a potential risk if `eval_type` is compromised.\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and structured.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — the main concern is the use of `eval_type` on string annotations, which could be risky if `eval_type` is unsafe or if untrusted input is processed. However, within the context of schema compilation, this is typical and controlled.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured type annotation handler for Strawberry GraphQL, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The potential risk is minimal and primarily related to the safety of `eval_type`, which should be trusted within the framework's context.",
