{
  "purpose": "A minimal Python CLI entry point that imports and executes the 'run()' function from a local 'cli' module when run as the main program.",
  "sources": "The import of 'run' from the local 'cli' module; the '__name__' check to determine execution context.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of 'run()' which may contain further logic; no direct sinks visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: when the script is executed directly, it calls the 'run()' function, potentially executing further code within 'cli'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in this code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python CLI entry point with minimal structure. It imports a 'run()' function and executes it if the script is run directly. The security and maliciousness depend entirely on the implementation of 'run()' in the 'cli' module, which is not provided. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (0.0 to 0.2), reflecting the minimal risk based solely on this snippet. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is effectively zero. The main concern for security would be the behavior of the 'run()' function in 'cli', which cannot be assessed here. Overall, the code appears safe and typical for a Python CLI application.",
