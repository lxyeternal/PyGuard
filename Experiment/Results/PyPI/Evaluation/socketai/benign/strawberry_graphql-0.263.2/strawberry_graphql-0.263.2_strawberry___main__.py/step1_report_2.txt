{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point for executing a CLI application by importing and running the 'run' function from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it imports a local module and executes a function.",
  "sinks": "The 'run' function may contain sinks, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "flows": "No data flows can be determined from this snippet; it simply calls a function in the main guard.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting only of an import statement and a main guard that executes 'run'. It appears to be a standard entry point pattern for a CLI application. Without seeing the implementation of 'run', there are no visible signs of malicious behavior. The structure is straightforward, with no suspicious code, data leaks, or obfuscated constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe main entry point for a CLI application.",
