{
  "purpose": "The code serves as the entry point for a Python application, executing the 'run' function from the 'cli' module when the script is executed directly.",
  "sources": "The code reads the execution context (if __name__ == \"__main__\") and imports the 'run' function from a relative 'cli' module.",
  "sinks": "The 'run' function is called, which may contain further logic, but no sinks are explicitly visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow is: script executed -> checks if __name__ == '__main__' -> calls 'run()' from 'cli' module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and follows standard Python entry point patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'run' function from a local 'cli' module and executes it if the script is run directly. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or network activity. The minimal structure suggests this is a typical entry point for a CLI application. Without inspecting the 'cli' module's contents, no malicious activity can be inferred from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python script serving as the entry point for an application. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this code snippet.",
