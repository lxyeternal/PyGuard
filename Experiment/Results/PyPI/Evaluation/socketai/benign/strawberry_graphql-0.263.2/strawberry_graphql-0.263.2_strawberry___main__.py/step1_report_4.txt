{
  "purpose": "To execute the 'run' function from the 'cli' module when the script is run as the main program.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .cli import run' and the condition '__name__ == \"__main__\"' that triggers 'run()' execution.",
  "sinks": "The 'run()' function call, which could potentially execute arbitrary or malicious code depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "When the script is executed directly, it imports 'run' and calls it, potentially executing code with whatever logic is inside 'run()'.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself is minimal and standard for CLI entry points; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical entry point for a Python package or module, importing a 'run' function from a local 'cli' module and executing it if run as the main program. Without inspecting the 'cli' module or the 'run' function, the code appears benign and standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical CLI bootstrap and contains no evident malicious behavior or security risks by itself. The security implications depend on the implementation of the 'run()' function in the 'cli' module, which is not provided. Based solely on this code, the risk is minimal.",
