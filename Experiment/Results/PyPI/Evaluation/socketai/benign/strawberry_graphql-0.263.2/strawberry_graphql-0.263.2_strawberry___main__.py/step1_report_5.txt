{
  "purpose": "To execute the 'run' function from the local 'cli' module when the script is run as the main program.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'run' function from a local module named 'cli'.",
  "sinks": "The 'run' function is invoked directly; without details of its implementation, potential sinks depend on what 'run' does internally.",
  "flows": "The script flows from import to the execution of 'run' if the script is executed as the main module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no obvious anomalies. It does not handle or process external input directly.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function and calls it conditionally on script execution. Without the implementation of 'run', there are no obvious security issues at this level. The code structure is typical for a command-line entry point. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The security of the overall behavior depends entirely on what 'run' does, which is not provided.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple entry point for a CLI application, with no immediate malicious behavior evident. However, a security assessment of the 'run' function is necessary for a comprehensive review.",
