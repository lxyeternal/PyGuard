{
  "purpose": "This code implements an asynchronous data loader with batching and caching capabilities for efficient data retrieval in Python applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method parameters such as 'key', 'keys', and 'data' mappings. It also reads internal state from 'self.cache_map' and batch task lists.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into 'set_result', 'set_exception' of Future objects, and into cache storage. No direct output or network sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'load' and 'load_many' source inputs into batch processing, then through 'dispatch_batch' where the load function results are set into futures, and cached if enabled.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code uses standard asyncio practices, and no external network calls or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a well-structured implementation of an asynchronous batching and caching system for data retrieval. It manages internal batch creation, dispatching load functions asynchronously, and caching results for efficiency. No malicious code or backdoors are detected. All data flows are controlled and related to expected data handling for such a system.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an asynchronous data loader with batching and caching, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It employs standard Python asyncio patterns and safe data handling practices.",
