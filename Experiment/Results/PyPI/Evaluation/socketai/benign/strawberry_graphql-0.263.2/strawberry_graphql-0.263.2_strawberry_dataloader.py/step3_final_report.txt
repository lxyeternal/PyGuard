  "purpose": "An async data loader implementing batching and caching mechanisms for efficient data retrieval in Python applications.",
  "sources": "Input keys provided to load() and load_many() functions, cache lookups in cache_map.",
  "sinks": "Cache set/delete operations, batch dispatch via dispatch_batch(), setting results or exceptions on futures.",
  "flows": "load() checks cache -> adds task to current batch -> dispatch_batch() calls load_fn -> sets result or exception on futures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard asyncio patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an asynchronous data loader with batching and caching. It uses asyncio futures, proper exception handling, and cache management. No signs of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The cache is managed via a simple dictionary, and batch dispatch is handled asynchronously with proper error propagation. The load_fn is user-supplied and external, which could be malicious outside this scope, but the code itself is benign. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is appropriately zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured async data loader with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores are justified and accurate.",
