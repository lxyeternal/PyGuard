  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n1. **Code content confirmation:**\n   - The code only defines two custom error classes (`BrowserNotFound`, `InstallError`) and an enum `BrowserEngine` with predefined string values.\n   - There are no data flows, external calls, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted data.\n   - The code is static, declarative, and intended for configuration or exception handling.\n\n2. **Evaluation of each report:**\n\n   - **Reports 1-5:**\n     - All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, contains no malicious patterns, and is safe.\n     - They all assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n     - The purpose, sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, and analysis sections consistently conclude benign intent.\n     - Confidence levels are high (1), and obfuscated scores are zero, matching the code's clarity.\n\n3. **Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n   - No issues are found in the reasoning or scoring.\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The reasoning dismisses any suspicion of malicious behavior, which is correct given the code.\n\n4. **Any assumptions or claims to challenge?**\n   - The reports assume the code is purely declarative and safe, which is accurate.\n   - No assumptions about hidden behavior or malicious intent are made, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Overall assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, safe module defining error classes and an enum.\n   - No vulnerabilities, malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n   - The scores and reasoning are reasonable and consistent.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n- The security risk score should stay at 0.\n- The confidence scores are appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, with no malicious or security issues. The current scoring and analysis are justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code snippet.",
