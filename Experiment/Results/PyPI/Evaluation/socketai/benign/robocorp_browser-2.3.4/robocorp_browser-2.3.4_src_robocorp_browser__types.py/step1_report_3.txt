  "purpose": "Define custom error classes and an enumeration for supported browser engines in the Playwright framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements from enum and playwright.sync_api; class definitions and enum members.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points for untrusted data or external output; no external resource access or data manipulation.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code solely declares classes and an enum.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, then defines two custom error classes and an enum for browser types. All classes and enum members are straightforward and do not perform any data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, defining error classes and an enum for browser types. It appears benign, with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
