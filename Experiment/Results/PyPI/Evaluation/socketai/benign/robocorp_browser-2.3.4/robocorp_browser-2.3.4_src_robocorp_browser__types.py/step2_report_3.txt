  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is purely declarative: defining custom error classes and an enum for browser engines.\n   - No issues, dynamic behavior, or data handling are present.\n   - The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they do not overlook any suspicious behavior.\n   - They correctly note the absence of obfuscation, malicious patterns, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` = 0\n     - `obfuscated` = 0\n     - `securityRisk` = 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - The `confidence` scores are all 1, reflecting certainty in their assessments, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No report assigns a risk score higher than 0.0; all are zero.\n   - This is appropriate; the code does not pose any security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n   - The code only defines classes and enums; no malicious patterns are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they rely on static code analysis.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as safe.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary of My Own Evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is a simple, static declaration of error classes and an enum.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.\n- The code is safe and does not introduce security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns.",
