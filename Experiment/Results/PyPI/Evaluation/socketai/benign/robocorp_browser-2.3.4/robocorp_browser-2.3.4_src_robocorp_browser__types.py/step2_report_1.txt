  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code presence and behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only defines custom error classes and an Enum for browser types.\n   - No dynamic code, data processing, external communication, or input handling is present.\n   - The code is static, declarative, and intended for configuration or exception handling.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or suspicious patterns:**\n   - No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are identified across all reports.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code appears standard and safe.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - Confidence is high (1), which is appropriate given the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - No issues warrant a high risk score; the code is benign.\n   - The reports' low scores are justified.\n\n5. **Potential issues or assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent; they focus on static analysis.\n   - No evidence suggests any hidden malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Overall assessment:**\n   - The code is safe, simple, and intended for defining constants and exceptions.\n   - The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The assigned scores reflect this appropriately. No further action or concern is necessary.",
