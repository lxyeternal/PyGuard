  "purpose": "Defines custom error classes and an enumeration for valid browser engine types used in Playwright automation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from enum and playwright.sync_api; class definitions and string constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling, external system calls, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; code primarily declares classes and enums.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Use of Enum for predefined values is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines error classes and an enum for browser types, which is typical in browser automation setups. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors. The code structure is straightforward and appears intended for configuration or exception handling within a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module defining custom exceptions and an enum for browser identifiers. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
