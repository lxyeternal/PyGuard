  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code in all reports is identical and straightforward: defining custom error classes and an enum for browser types.\n- There are no data flows, external calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n- The code appears purely declarative, serving as configuration or constants.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Define custom error classes and enum.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the code is safe, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar, defining errors and enum.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 3\n- Same reasoning applies.\n- **Scores:** all zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 4\n- Same observations.\n- **Scores:** all zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- Same reasoning.\n- **Scores:** all zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Recommendations:\n\n- **Code presence:** Confirmed to be just class and enum definitions, with no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification for scores > 0.5:** None of the reports justify higher scores; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is sound.\n- **Consistency:** The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Overall:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary. The analysis and scores are appropriate given the code snippet.",
