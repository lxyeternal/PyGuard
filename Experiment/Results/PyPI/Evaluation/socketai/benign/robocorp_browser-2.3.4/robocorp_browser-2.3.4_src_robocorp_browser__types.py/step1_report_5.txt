  "purpose": "Defines custom error classes and an enumeration for browser engines used in Playwright automation.",
  "sources": "Imports from enum module and playwright.sync_api.Error; no input data sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present; no data leaks or external calls are observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code is primarily class and enum definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom error classes inheriting from standard exceptions and an enumeration for supported browser engines. There are no input reading mechanisms, external communications, or dynamic code execution. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module establishing custom exceptions and an enum for browser types. It contains no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
