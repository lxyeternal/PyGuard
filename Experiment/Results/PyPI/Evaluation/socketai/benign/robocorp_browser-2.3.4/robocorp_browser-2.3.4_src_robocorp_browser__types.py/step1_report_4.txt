  "purpose": "Define custom error classes and an enumeration for valid Playwright browser engines.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules, class and enum definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; classes and enums are static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions, exception subclasses, and an enum. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code appears straightforward, well-structured, and typical for a configuration or constants module. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module defining error classes and an enum for browser engine options, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
