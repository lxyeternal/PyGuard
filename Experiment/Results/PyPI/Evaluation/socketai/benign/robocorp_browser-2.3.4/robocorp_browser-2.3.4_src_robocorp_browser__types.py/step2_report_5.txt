  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the scoring, and the logical consistency.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code is a straightforward module defining two custom error classes (`BrowserNotFound`, `InstallError`) and an enum (`BrowserEngine`) listing browser types.\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static, declarative, and contains no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- No sources, sinks, or data flows involving untrusted data are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears safe, standard, and intended for configuration or exception handling within a larger system.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Issue Analysis:\n\n**Presence of Issues:**\n- The reports assign all issues a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0.\n- The code does not contain any logic that could be malicious, such as code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- The code does not handle user input, external data, or perform network operations.\n- The error classes inherit from standard exceptions, and the enum is a typical pattern for constants.\n\n**Are the reported issues present?**\n- Yes, the reports correctly conclude that there are no issues present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Scores and Reasoning:\n\n**Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0` and `obfuscated: 0`, which is consistent with the code content.\n- The code is not obfuscated, nor does it contain any obfuscation patterns.\n\n**Risk Scores:**\n- All reports assign `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The `score` fields are either 1 or 1.0, indicating high confidence that the code is safe.\n\n**Potential for higher scores?**\n- No, the code is purely declarative with no security implications. Therefore, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is purely based on static code review.\n- The code's purpose is clear and standard, with no hidden or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Adjustments to scores:** None needed; all scores are appropriate.\n- **Overall assessment:** The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, well-structured, and free of security issues. The reports' assessments are accurate and should remain as is.",
