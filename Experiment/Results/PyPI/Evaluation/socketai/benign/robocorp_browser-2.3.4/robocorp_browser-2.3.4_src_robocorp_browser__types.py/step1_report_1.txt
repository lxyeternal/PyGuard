  "purpose": "Define custom error classes and an enumeration for valid Playwright browser engines.",
  "sources": "Import statements from enum and playwright.sync_api modules.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or output functions.",
  "flows": "None; code only declares classes and enum without data flow or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines two custom error classes inheriting from Error and RuntimeError, and an Enum class listing valid browser engine strings for Playwright. There is no dynamic code execution, data handling, or external communication. The classes and enum serve as structured constants and error types, which are common and safe. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, safe module defining error classes and an enum for browser types. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
