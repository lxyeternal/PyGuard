  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class and enum definitions with no dynamic behavior, external calls, or data processing. It is straightforward, static, and serves as configuration or exception handling. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
