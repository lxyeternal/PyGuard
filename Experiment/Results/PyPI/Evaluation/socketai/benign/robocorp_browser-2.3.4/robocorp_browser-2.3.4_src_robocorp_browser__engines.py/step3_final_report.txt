  "purpose": "Manage browser installation via Playwright, handling environment paths, subprocess execution, and threading for asynchronous process management.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('RCC_HOLOTREE_SPACE_ROOT', 'PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH'), subprocess commands invoking 'python -m playwright install', and process stdout streams.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution, environment variable usage, and logging; no data leaks or external network connections observed.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variables and subprocess commands -> Sink: subprocess invocation and output handling via threads and futures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate setup tasks for browser installation, using subprocesses with controlled commands, environment variables for configuration, and threading for process output management. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The environment variables are used for configuration, not malicious purposes. The subprocess calls are standard and do not involve unsafe input handling. Threading and futures are used appropriately for asynchronous process management. No network activity or data exfiltration is evident. The code's structure and logic are clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing browser installation with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
