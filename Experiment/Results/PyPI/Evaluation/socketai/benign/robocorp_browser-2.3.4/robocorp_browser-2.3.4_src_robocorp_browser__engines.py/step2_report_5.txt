  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code performs legitimate browser installation tasks. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. The environment variables and subprocess handling are standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0. These are reasonable given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it finds no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code manages subprocesses and environment variables securely.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2. The slight security risk score reflects the potential misuse of environment variables but is still low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Also aligns with previous reports. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The code handles subprocesses and environment variables properly.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2. Consistent with prior reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The subprocess and environment variable handling are standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code performs expected setup and installation routines.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified. The code executes external commands for browser installation but does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code is straightforward, uses standard modules, and is not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in most reports, reflecting the potential misuse of environment variables but not indicating actual malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.2** — Minor, mostly due to environment variable reliance, but not dangerous.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The code's subprocess handling, environment variable usage, and threading are standard practices for such setup routines.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, command injection, or malicious payloads.\n- The environment variables are used for configuration, not for malicious purposes.\n- The overall security posture is sound, with no signs of sabotage or malware.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are appropriate and justified based on the reports and code analysis.",
