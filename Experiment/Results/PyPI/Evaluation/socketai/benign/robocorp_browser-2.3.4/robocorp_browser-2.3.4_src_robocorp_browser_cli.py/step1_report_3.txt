{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for installing browsers using the robocorp.browser tool, primarily handling argument parsing and invoking installation routines.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from command-line arguments via argparse (args), specifically 'engine', 'force', and 'isolated'.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the 'install_browser' function call, which performs browser installation based on user input.",
  "flows": "User inputs (engine types and flags) flow from argparse into the '_install_command' function, which calls 'install_browser' with these parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code, or hidden behaviors are present. The import of 'cli' from 'robocorp.tasks' appears to be for truststore injection but is commented to be ignored for malicious intent. The code appears standard for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical CLI wrapper for installing browsers, using argparse to parse commands and options. It invokes an external function 'install_browser' with user parameters. There are no indications of data leaks, network connections, or malicious code. The import comment suggests a side effect related to truststore setup but is not inherently malicious. Exception handling is limited to interruption and install errors, with clean exit behavior. Overall, the code seems benign, with no suspicious activities or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI interface for browser installation, with no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security issues. It primarily facilitates user-initiated browser setup without performing harmful operations.",
