  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a CLI utility for installing browsers via `install_browser`.\n- They note the import from `robocorp.tasks`, which triggers truststore injection, but consider this an expected side effect, not malicious.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code's purpose is straightforward: parse arguments, invoke installation routines, handle errors gracefully.\n- No evidence of network exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Presence:\n- The core logic (`install_browser`) is invoked as expected.\n- The argument parsing and control flow are standard.\n- The import `from robocorp.tasks import cli` is present and triggers truststore injection, which is documented as an intended side effect.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n- The reports correctly interpret the purpose and behavior.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made without evidence.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal concern primarily due to truststore injection side effect, which is documented and expected.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The only notable side effect is the truststore injection via import, but this is documented and standard within certain security contexts.\n- No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or backdoors are present.\n- The code is typical for CLI tools managing system components.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n- The security risk score could be slightly increased if considering truststore injection, but since it's documented, 0.1–0.2 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Expert Estimate:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with reports)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears benign, well-documented, and intended for legitimate purposes within the robocorp ecosystem. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security compromise.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the context of truststore injection—if this side effect is expected and documented, it does not elevate the security risk significantly. If future reports indicate hidden behaviors or obfuscation, reassessment would be necessary.",
