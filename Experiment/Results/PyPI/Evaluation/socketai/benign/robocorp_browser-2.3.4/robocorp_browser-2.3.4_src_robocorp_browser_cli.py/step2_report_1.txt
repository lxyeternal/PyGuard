  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides a CLI for installing browsers via `robocorp.browser`.\n- Uses `argparse` to handle commands and options.\n- Calls `install_browser` with user-specified engines and flags.\n- Imports `cli` from `robocorp.tasks`, which triggers truststore injection (noted as a side effect).\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are observed.\n- Exception handling is minimal and standard.\n- No network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious activities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity?** No.\n- **Hardcoded secrets or backdoors?** No.\n- **Obfuscated code?** No.\n- **Suspicious dynamic code or network activity?** No.\n- **Malware or malicious intent?** No.\n\n### Flaws or issues:\n- The only side effect of note is the import from `robocorp.tasks`, which triggers truststore injection. This is documented and appears to be an intended, benign side effect related to trust management.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0` — consistent with the code.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are low (~0.1-0.2), which seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n- The `obfuscated` scores are 0, matching the code clarity.\n- The `confidence` scores are high (~0.9), which is justified.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- The truststore injection via import is noted but is a documented side effect, not malicious.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities or exploits.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Given the lack of malicious activity and the benign purpose, a **0.1-0.2** range is appropriate.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, related to truststore injection side effect, which is documented and expected.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a straightforward CLI utility for browser installation with no malicious intent or security issues. The truststore injection side effect is not malicious but should be acknowledged as a side effect, not a vulnerability.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed to the scores. The overall security posture of this code is benign.",
