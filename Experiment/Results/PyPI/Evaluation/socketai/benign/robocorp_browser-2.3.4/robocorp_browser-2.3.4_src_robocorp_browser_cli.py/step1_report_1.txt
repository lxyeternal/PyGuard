{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for installing browsers via the robocorp.browser tool, including argument parsing and invoking installation routines.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv; imports from robocorp.tasks and local modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially triggers browser installation processes, which may involve downloading files and executing installation routines.",
  "flows": "User input via command-line arguments flows into install_browser function calls, which perform installations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of 'cli' import for truststore injection is noted but is commented as for truststore, not malicious activity. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up an argument parser to handle install commands for browsers, with options for force and isolated installation. It calls install_browser for each specified engine, which likely performs downloads and installations. No code performs network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications outside standard installation routines. The only notable import is from robocorp.tasks, which triggers truststore injection, but this is documented and part of the expected behavior. No suspicious activity, malicious code, or malicious behavior patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate CLI utility for managing browser installations within the robocorp ecosystem. No malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The only potential concern is the truststore injection trigger, but it is an expected, documented side effect and not malicious.",
