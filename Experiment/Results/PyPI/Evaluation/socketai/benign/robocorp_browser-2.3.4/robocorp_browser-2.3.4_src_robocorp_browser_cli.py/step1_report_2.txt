  "purpose": "Command-line tool for installing browser engines used by robocorp.browser",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments parsed by argparse",
  "sinks": "install_browser function, which likely performs network or system operations based on the engine parameter",
  "flows": "User provides 'install' command with engine choices -> args passed to _install_command -> install_browser invoked with engine and flags",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, no unusual variable names",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a CLI interface to trigger the installation of browser engines. It imports modules and triggers truststore injection via robocorp.tasks. The core operation involves calling install_browser with specified parameters. There are no apparent data leaks, network communications, or malicious activities evident within this code. The presence of the import 'cli' from robocorp.tasks may relate to trust management, but it does not itself indicate malicious behavior. The functions and arguments used are standard for CLI tools, and no suspicious code patterns or embedded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around the install_browser functionality. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious network activity, or security risks based on the provided code. The use of the robocorp.tasks import appears to be related to truststore setup, not malicious activity.",
