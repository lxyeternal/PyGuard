  "purpose": "A command-line utility for managing the installation of browser engines in the robocorp ecosystem.",
  "sources": "Imports from robocorp.tasks, argparse inputs from command line arguments",
  "sinks": "install_browser function call, sys.exit on exceptions",
  "flows": "User provides command-line arguments → arguments parsed and passed to _install_command → install_browser called with parameters",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed; no malicious data handling; no obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The script sets up an argument parser for a CLI tool to install browser engines. It imports trusted modules, triggers truststore injection via import, and calls install_browser with parameters derived from user input. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as network exfiltration, system tampering, or backdoors, are evident. The exception handling is standard, only exiting on known errors. No unsafe data handling, no use of untrusted input beyond standard argument parsing, and no obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI utility for installing browsers with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
