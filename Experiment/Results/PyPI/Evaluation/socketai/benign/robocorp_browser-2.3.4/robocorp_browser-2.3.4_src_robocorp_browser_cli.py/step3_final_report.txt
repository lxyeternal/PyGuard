  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for installing browsers via robocorp.browser, handling argument parsing and invoking installation routines.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments parsed via argparse; import from robocorp.tasks triggering truststore injection.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of install_browser which may perform downloads or system modifications; no untrusted data flows to network or files.",
  "flows": "Arguments flow from CLI input into install_browser; import triggers truststore setup as a side effect.",
  "anomalies": "Import from robocorp.tasks triggers truststore injection; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper for browser installation, with argument parsing and error handling. The import from robocorp.tasks causes truststore injection, which is documented and intended, not malicious. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, security risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The only side effect is truststore setup, which is a normal, documented process in secure environments. No logical flaws or security issues are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility for managing browser installations, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The truststore injection is an expected, non-malicious side effect. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
