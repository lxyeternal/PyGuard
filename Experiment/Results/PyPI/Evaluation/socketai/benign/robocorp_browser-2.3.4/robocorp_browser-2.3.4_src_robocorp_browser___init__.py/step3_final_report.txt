{
  "purpose": "This code provides a wrapper around Playwright for browser automation, including configuration, page management, screenshot capturing, and browser installation.",
  "sources": "Function arguments such as configuration parameters, URLs, elements, and locators; external functions for browser setup and logging.",
  "sinks": "Embedding screenshots as HTML in logs; navigation to URLs; browser and context creation; no external data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into Playwright API calls (e.g., goto, screenshot); logs embed base64 images; configuration flows into browser and context setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows. Logging screenshots as HTML is standard debugging practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper for Playwright, managing browser and page lifecycle, configurations, and logging. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling is present. The embedding of screenshots in logs is a common debugging feature. The installation process relies on external, presumably safe functions. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security flaws are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign automation library with no security concerns. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious data flows. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is appropriate given its functionality as a browser automation wrapper.",
