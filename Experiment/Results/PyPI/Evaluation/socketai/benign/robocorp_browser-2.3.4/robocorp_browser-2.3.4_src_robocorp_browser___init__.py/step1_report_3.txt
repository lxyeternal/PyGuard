{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to configure and control browser automation using Playwright, including browser setup, page interactions, screenshots, and browser installation.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters (e.g., URL, configuration kwargs, elements, locator, page), and internal modules like _context, _config, and _engines which manage state and configuration.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows include URLs for navigation, elements for screenshots, and configuration parameters. No untrusted data is written to external systems or sensitive locations directly.",
  "flows": "Sources like URL or element inputs are used in functions such as goto() and screenshot(). These data flow into browser actions like page.goto() and element.screenshot(), but there are no apparent insecure flows or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are observed. The code primarily calls external Playwright APIs and manages browser context/state. The install() function downloads browsers but does not indicate malicious behavior. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a high-level wrapper around Playwright for browser automation, providing configuration, page control, and installation functions. It relies heavily on external libraries and internal modules for state management. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior are evident. The functions seem to perform typical automation tasks. There are no hardcoded secrets, external network communications, or covert operations. The use of logging and screenshot functionalities appears legitimate. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, well-structured automation utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard browser automation interface with no detectable malicious intent or security risks. It uses external libraries appropriately and manages internal state securely. No malware or malicious behavior is observed, and the code appears safe for use.",
