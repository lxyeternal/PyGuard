{
  "purpose": "The code provides a framework for browser automation using Playwright, allowing configuration, page interaction, and browser management.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function arguments such as URLs, element locators, and configuration parameters; environment variables are not directly used.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the 'screenshot' function which logs images; 'goto' navigates to URLs; 'install' downloads browsers; 'configure' and 'configure_context' modify settings. No direct data leaks or malicious network activity are evident.",
  "flows": "Flow from function inputs (e.g., URL, element handles, configuration options) to actions like navigating pages, taking screenshots, or installing browsers; no evidence of data being sent or manipulated maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code uses standard Playwright API calls and logging mechanisms. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured wrapper around Playwright APIs for browser automation, including configuration, page handling, screenshots, and browser installation. It utilizes standard Python practices with no signs of malicious activity. There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated sections. The logging of screenshots is a benign feature intended for debugging or record-keeping. The code does not include any data exfiltration or unauthorized access behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a legitimate framework for browser automation with no indications of malicious intent. It handles browser setup, navigation, and screenshot capture securely, relying on standard APIs and patterns. No security risks or malware signals are detected.",
