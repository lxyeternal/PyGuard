{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to execute the main function from the robocorp.browser.cli module when the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'main' from 'robocorp.browser.cli' when the script is run as '__main__'.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function could potentially perform actions that involve untrusted input, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "flows": "The script flow is straightforward: upon execution, it calls 'main()' from the imported module; actual data flow depends on the implementation of 'main()' which is not provided.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is minimal and standard for a script entry point.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical entry point that imports and runs a main function from a module. No suspicious or malicious code is visible here. However, since 'main()' is imported from an external module, its behavior cannot be assessed from this snippet alone. There are no signs of malware, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior in this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple script launcher and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks by itself. Its security assessment depends on the implementation of 'robocorp.browser.cli.main()', which is not provided here.",
