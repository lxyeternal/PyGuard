  "flows": "Import -> function call to 'main()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally executes the 'main' function from the 'robocorp.browser.cli' module if the script is run directly. This pattern is typical for CLI entry points. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The import and function call are standard for Python scripts designed to run as main programs. The only potential concern would be the behavior of 'main()' itself, but that is outside the scope of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point for executing a CLI tool. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident within this snippet.",
