  "purpose": "To execute the main function from the robocorp.browser.cli module when the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'main' from 'robocorp.browser.cli' when the script runs.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of 'main()' function, which may execute code within the imported module.",
  "flows": "If __name__ == '__main__' evaluates true, 'main()' is called, executing the imported 'main' function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only imports and executes a main function.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'main' from 'robocorp.browser.cli' and executes it if the script is run as the main program. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present. The source and sink are typical for CLI entry points. The code depends on the behavior of 'robocorp.browser.cli.main', which cannot be assessed here, but the script itself does not contain malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python entry point that delegates execution to a function in an external module. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
