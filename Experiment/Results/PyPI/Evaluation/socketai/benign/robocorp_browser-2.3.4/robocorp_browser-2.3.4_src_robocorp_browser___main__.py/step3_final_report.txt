{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal CLI entry point that imports and executes the main() function from the robocorp.browser.cli module when run directly.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import from robocorp.browser.cli and the execution trigger via the __name__ check.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows within this snippet; any potential effects depend on the external main() function.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: if __name__ == '__main__', import main and execute it. No other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present in this code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python script pattern for CLI entry points. It conditionally imports and calls main() from an external module. The code itself is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The security implications depend entirely on the external main() function, which is outside the scope of this snippet. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate given the simplicity and standard pattern of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the external main() function. The existing reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with this analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
