  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal, standard Python script that conditionally imports and executes `main()` from `robocorp.browser.cli`.\n- None of the reports identify any suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code within this snippet.\n- The behavior depends entirely on the external `robocorp.browser.cli.main()` function, which is outside the scope of this code fragment.\n- The security risk scores assigned are uniformly low (0.1 or 0), which seems appropriate given the simplicity and lack of direct malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the **original code** exactly.\n- There are **no errors, flaws, or mistakes** in the logic or reasoning of the reports.\n- The **scores** assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1 or 0) are reasonable.\n\n### Critical review:\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0; no malicious behavior is suggested.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in most reports, which is acceptable considering the code's simplicity and reliance on external functions. Since the external `main()` could perform malicious actions, but there's no evidence here, the low score is justified.\n- **Confidence levels:** Mostly high (0.8–1), which is appropriate given the minimal code and standard pattern.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports correctly note that the actual security implications depend on `robocorp.browser.cli.main()`. Without inspecting that, the overall risk cannot be fully assessed, but based on this snippet alone, the risk remains low.\n- No signs of obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present, and the code is typical for CLI entry points.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Scores I would assign based on this review:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, standard pattern, external dependency unknown but no signs of issues)\n\nThe reports' scores are consistent with my evaluation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is benign, standard, and poses no security risk based solely on this snippet. The external `main()` function's behavior remains unknown, but that is outside the scope of this review.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed to the reports' assessments.",
