  "purpose": "Invoke the main function from robocorp.browser.cli when executed as a script.",
  "sources": "The script reads no external input or data directly; it simply calls an imported function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions are present.",
  "flows": "Execution flow is straightforward: if run as main, it calls the main() function from robocorp.browser.cli.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for '__main__' to determine if it is run as a script. It then imports 'main' from 'robocorp.browser.cli' and executes it. There are no apparent malicious behaviors, data handling, or security risks. The code acts as a simple entry point to a CLI tool. Since the actual behavior depends on 'robocorp.browser.cli.main', which is external, this code itself is benign and standard for a command-line script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical script entry point with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely delegates execution to an external module. No malware or security issues detected.",
