  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a minimal, standard Python script acting as an entry point.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The core behavior depends entirely on `robocorp.browser.cli.main()`, which is external and not assessable here.\n- The code itself does not process untrusted data, nor does it contain any sinks or data flows that could lead to security issues.\n- The security risk scores assigned are very low (0.1 or 0), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippet matches the original code: a typical `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block importing and calling `main()`.\n- No discrepancies or errors are evident in the code logic or structure.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify that the actual behavior depends on `robocorp.browser.cli.main()`.\n- No flaws or mistakes are apparent in the reasoning or summaries.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which seems reasonable given the code is a simple delegate to an external module. Since the external module's behavior is unknown, a very low risk score is justified.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- The code is a standard entry point with no inherent security issues.\n- The only potential concern is the behavior of `robocorp.browser.cli.main()`, but since it's external and unassessed here, the risk remains minimal.\n- The slight increase to 0.1 reflects minimal inherent risk in executing external code.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about `main()`'s behavior.\n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are present.\n- The consistency across reports is good.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated overall security risk score:** **0.1** (reflecting minimal inherent risk of executing external code)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis: the code itself is benign, and any potential security issues depend solely on the external module's implementation, which cannot be determined here.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, benign script entry point with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores are appropriate given the information available.",
