{
  "purpose": "Defines a configuration class for setting up and managing browser automation settings, including browser type, headless mode, screenshots, and persistence options.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the _BrowserConfig constructor and property setters, especially 'persistent_context_directory' and 'browser_engine'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe usage could be the 'persistent_context_directory' if malicious paths are provided; no other immediate sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Constructor and property setters receive input data; 'persistent_context_directory' is stored for later use in browser session management.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs. No network activity or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a configuration object with input validation via assertions and type conversions. It uses property setters and getters to manage internal state. There are no dynamic code executions, no external data fetches, nor any suspicious logic. The only potential concern is that 'persistent_context_directory' can accept arbitrary paths, but this is typical for such configurations and does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration class for browser automation with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It does not perform any network operations, file modifications, or contain hidden backdoors. Overall, it is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
