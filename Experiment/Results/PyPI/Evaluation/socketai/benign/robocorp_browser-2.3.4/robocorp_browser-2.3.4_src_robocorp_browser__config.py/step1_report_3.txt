{
  "purpose": "Defines a configuration class for browser automation settings, including properties like browser engine, headless mode, screenshot options, and session caching.",
  "sources": "Imports from pathlib, typing, robocorp.tasks, and local modules; class constructor parameters; property setters; session_cache decorator",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data output or external data transmission observed",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor inputs to class properties; properties may receive external or user-defined values but are validated and not used for further insecure actions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual patterns; standard property validation and class design; no hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a configuration class for browser automation, validating inputs through assertions and property setters. It utilizes a session cache for reuse. No external data processing, network connections, or sensitive operations are detected. There is no obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior; the code appears to be a legitimate configuration utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward configuration class for browser automation with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is a standard implementation for managing browser settings with proper input validation.",
