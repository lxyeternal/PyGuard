  "purpose": "Defines a configuration class for browser automation settings, including properties such as browser engine, headless mode, slow motion, screenshots, and persistent context directory.",
  "sources": "User or external code setting property values (via constructor or setters), import statements, session_cache decorator",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or environment variable usage are present",
  "flows": "Initialization and property setters flow data from external inputs into class attributes; no malicious data flow identified",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. Use of assertions for property validation is standard. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of a configuration class with property validation and a session cache function returning its instance. All properties are validated with assertions, and the class is used for managing browser automation settings. No suspicious, malicious, or maliciously intended behaviors are detected. There are no network connections, data leaks, or system manipulations. The import statements are benign. The session_cache decorator likely manages session persistence but does not introduce security concerns itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration class for browser automation with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It handles user-defined settings securely without hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. The overall security risk is very low.",
