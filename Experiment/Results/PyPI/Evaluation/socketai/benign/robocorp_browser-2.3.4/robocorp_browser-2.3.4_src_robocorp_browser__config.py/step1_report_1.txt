  "purpose": "Defines a configuration class for setting up a web browser environment used in automation tasks.",
  "sources": "Input sources include constructor arguments, property setters, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present; no data flow leads to network, file system, or sensitive data leakage.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters are set through constructor and property setters; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are detected. The code mainly consists of standard class definitions, property management, and type assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python class encapsulating browser configuration options, with typical getter and setter methods enforcing type checks. It imports modules for type hints and session caching but does not perform any I/O, network communication, or cryptographic operations. The session_cache decorator suggests some form of caching but is not inherently malicious. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads. No suspicious or malicious logic, external data leaks, or malicious side effects are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate configuration class for browser automation with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as part of a larger system to manage browser settings securely. The overall security risk is minimal.",
