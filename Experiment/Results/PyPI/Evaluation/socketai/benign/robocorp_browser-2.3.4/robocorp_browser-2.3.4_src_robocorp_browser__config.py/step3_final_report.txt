{
  "purpose": "Defines a configuration class for browser automation settings, managing parameters like browser engine, headless mode, screenshots, and persistent context directory.",
  "sources": "Constructor arguments, property setters, imported modules, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; configuration parameters are stored internally without external data flow.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters through property setters to internal attributes; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. The 'persistent_context_directory' accepts arbitrary paths, which could be misused but is standard in such configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured configuration class with input validation via assertions. It uses property decorators for encapsulation and a session caching decorator for reuse. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The only potential concern is the acceptance of arbitrary directory paths, which could be exploited if malicious paths are supplied, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard configuration utility for browser automation with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate, and the malware score is 0. Obfuscation is absent. Overall, the supply chain security of this code is sound.",
