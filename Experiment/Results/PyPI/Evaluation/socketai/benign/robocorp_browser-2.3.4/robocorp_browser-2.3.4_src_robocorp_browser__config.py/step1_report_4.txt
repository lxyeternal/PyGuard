{
  "purpose": "Define a configuration class for browser automation settings used in robotic process automation tasks.",
  "sources": "Input sources include constructor arguments and property setters for configuration values such as 'browser_engine', 'install', 'headless', 'slowmo', 'screenshot', 'isolated', and 'persistent_context_directory'.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage or malicious activity could occur if configuration values are misused, but there are no direct sinks like network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted code in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor inputs and property setters into internal variables; no external data flow or untrusted data processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is standard class and property definition with input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class '_BrowserConfig' with configurable attributes for browser automation. It performs input validation through assertions but does not execute untrusted or external data. The 'session_cache' decorator indicates some form of caching, but it does not pose an immediate security risk. No network calls, system modifications, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward, focusing solely on configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration class for browser automation with proper input validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malware. It is safe based on the provided snippet.",
