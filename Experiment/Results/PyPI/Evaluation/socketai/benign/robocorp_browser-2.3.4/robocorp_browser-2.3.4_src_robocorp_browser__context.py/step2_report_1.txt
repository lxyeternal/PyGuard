  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious code detected. The code manages browser sessions, environment variables, and configurations in a standard way. The malware score is 0, and confidence is high (0.95). The security risk is minimal (0.1).\n- **Assessment:** The logic is sound, and no malicious behavior is evident. The use of environment variables and error handling aligns with typical practices.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious activity or obfuscation. The code manages browser setup with standard techniques. Malware score is 0, confidence 0.9, security risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears legitimate. The only concern is the potential misuse of environment variables, but this is common in such frameworks and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation. Standard environment variable handling and error management. Malware score is 0, confidence 0.9, risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical setup for browser automation, with no suspicious elements.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity or obfuscation. Standard environment variable and path handling. Malware score is 0, confidence 0.9, risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Legitimate code for managing browsers, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is a standard utility for browser management. Malware score is 0, confidence 0.9, risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports find any malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code. All indicate that the code is standard for browser automation and management.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher than zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting the potential risks associated with environment variable manipulation and browser installation paths, but these are standard in such frameworks.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code, a **0.2** seems appropriate, considering potential misconfigurations or environment manipulation, but not malicious intent.\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n- The code appears to be a well-structured, legitimate utility for managing browsers in an automation context.\n- No evidence supports any malicious activity, backdoors, or malware.\n- The environment variable and path handling are typical for such frameworks and do not raise security concerns unless the environment is compromised externally.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The overall scores should remain at **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, and **risk = 0.2**. The code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
