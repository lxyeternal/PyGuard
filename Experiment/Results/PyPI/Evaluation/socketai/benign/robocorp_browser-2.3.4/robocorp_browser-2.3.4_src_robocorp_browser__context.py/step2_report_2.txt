  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the provided code and evaluating the reasoning, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary & Purpose:** The code manages browser sessions, configurations, and teardown for Playwright in an automation environment. It relies on environment variables and configuration functions, with no suspicious behavior noted.\n\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The logic aligns with standard browser automation practices.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.95.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low security risk score is appropriate given the code's purpose and the absence of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary & Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on configuring and launching browsers with session caching.\n\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, and standard environment variable usage. The only potential concern is the manipulation of environment variables and paths, but these are typical in such frameworks.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The security risk score remains low, justified by the lack of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary & Purpose:** Again, managing browser instances and contexts with environment variables and configuration.\n\n- **Findings:** No obfuscated code, secrets, or malicious network activity. The environment variable handling and path configuration are standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is appropriate. No suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary & Purpose:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on session and browser management.\n\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious code or backdoors. Environment variables and error handling are standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary & Purpose:** Utility functions for managing browsers and contexts, with environment variable handling.\n\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code appears to be standard for browser automation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code and typical security considerations.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected across all reports. The code is focused on browser setup, environment management, and resource cleanup—common in automation frameworks.\n\n- **Obfuscation & Secrets:** No obfuscated code or hardcoded secrets are present. Use of environment variables is standard.\n\n- **Security Risks:** The only minor concern could be environment variable manipulation or browser installation paths, but these are typical and not inherently malicious.\n\n- **Malware Score Justification:** Given the absence of network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system modifications, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score Justification:** No obfuscation detected; score remains 0.\n\n- **Risk Score Justification:** The overall security risk is low, around 0.1–0.2, reflecting typical concerns about environment variable manipulation but no active threats.\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Minor concerns about environment variable reliance, but nothing malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code appears legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Recommendations:** No changes needed. Continue monitoring for environment variable misuse or external dependencies, but overall, the code is safe.",
