{
  "purpose": "This code provides a set of utility functions for managing and launching Playwright browsers and contexts within the Robocorp automation framework, including configuration, environment setup, and session management.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., RPA_HEADLESS_MODE, PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH), configuration functions (browser_config()), and internal function calls for browser/ context creation.",
  "sinks": "Browser launch methods, environment variable modifications, and function calls that could initiate browser processes or read configurations.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence launch options -> Functions determine browser type and launch parameters -> Browser launch or context creation -> Usage of environment variables and configurations during browser setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. Use of environment variables for configuration is standard. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically manages browser setup with attention to environment conditions, user configurations, and error handling. It uses environment variables for control over headless mode and browser paths, and includes mechanisms for session caching and error handling. There are no indications of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The only notable aspect is the careful handling of browser installation and launch, which appears to be legitimate. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network data exfiltration or system damage, is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility module for managing Playwright browsers within the Robocorp framework. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It primarily manages browser sessions, configurations, and environment setup securely.",
