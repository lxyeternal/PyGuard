  "purpose": "Manage browser instances, contexts, and configurations for Playwright automation, including environment setup, error handling, and resource cleanup.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., RPA_HEADLESS_MODE, PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH), configuration functions (browser_config), filesystem paths, and external modules for browser installation and logging.",
  "sinks": "Browser launch functions, context creation, page navigation, and error handling routines that interact with the filesystem, environment, and external browser binaries.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence launch options; configuration functions determine behavior; browser launch functions initiate browsers or contexts; error handling triggers installation routines; cleanup occurs during context and browser closure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Usage of environment variables and paths is standard for automation frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code manages browser automation sessions with standard practices, including environment variable checks, error handling for missing browsers, and resource cleanup. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The environment variables used are typical for controlling headless mode and paths. Error handling for missing browsers correctly triggers installation routines. The overall structure is clear, with proper separation of concerns. No signs of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, reverse shells, or data theft are evident. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscated as 0, and the security risk as low (~0.2), primarily due to environment variable reliance, which is common in such setups.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for managing Playwright browsers in an automation context. It contains no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 accurately reflect its benign nature and minimal security concerns.",
