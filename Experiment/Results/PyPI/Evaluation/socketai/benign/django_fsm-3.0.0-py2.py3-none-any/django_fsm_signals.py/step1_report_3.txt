{
  "purpose": "Define two Django signals for pre- and post-transition events",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; only internal signal definitions",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; just signal instantiation",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's Signal class and creates two signal objects named 'pre_transition' and 'post_transition'. This is typical in Django applications for event handling. There are no input data reads, no untrusted data sources, and no data leakage points. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard pattern for event signaling in Django projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Django signals with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a normal part of Django application architecture for event handling.",
