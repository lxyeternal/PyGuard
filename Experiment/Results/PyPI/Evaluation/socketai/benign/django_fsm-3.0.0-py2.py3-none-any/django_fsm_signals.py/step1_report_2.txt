  "purpose": "Define custom Django signals for pre- and post-transition events",
  "sources": "Django's dispatch.Signal module",
  "sinks": "Signal instances (pre_transition, post_transition) that could be connected to handlers",
  "flows": "Signals are created and may be used elsewhere to emit or listen to events",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code behavior, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's Signal class and creates two instances: pre_transition and post_transition. These are standard Django signals for event handling. There are no inputs, no external data processing, and no suspicious code patterns. The signals are simply defined, with no handlers or dynamic behavior included. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical pattern in Django applications for defining signals; it does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code's purpose is to facilitate event-driven communication within a Django app.",
