  "purpose": "Define two Django signals, 'pre_transition' and 'post_transition', for use in event handling within a Django application.",
  "sources": "Import of 'django.dispatch.Signal' and creation of 'pre_transition' and 'post_transition' signal instances.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only creates signal objects without data flow or external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, standard Django signal definitions with no obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's Signal class and defines two signal instances. It contains no data processing, input/output, external data handling, or dynamic behavior. The code is minimal, standard, and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify this as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Django signals setup with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and the overall assessment confirms the absence of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
