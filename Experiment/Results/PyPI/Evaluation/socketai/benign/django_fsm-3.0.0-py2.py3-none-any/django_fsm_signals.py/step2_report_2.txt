  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code simply imports Django's Signal class and defines two signal objects: `pre_transition` and `post_transition`.\n   - There are no data flows, no external inputs, no data sinks, and no suspicious code patterns.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that this is a typical Django signals setup with no malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The analysis and conclusions are appropriate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Since there's no malicious behavior, no security risk, and no obfuscation, the scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code is standard Django code, with no malicious payloads or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and standard patterns.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and analysis provided.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the repeated confirmation that this is a standard, benign Django signals setup, I concur with the reports' assessments.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
