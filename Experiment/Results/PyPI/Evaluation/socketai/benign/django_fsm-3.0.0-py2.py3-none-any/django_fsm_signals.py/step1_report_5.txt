  "purpose": "Define two Django signals for pre- and post-transition events",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for Django signal definitions; no suspicious or unusual code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'Signal' class from Django's dispatch module and defines two signals, 'pre_transition' and 'post_transition'. There are no inputs, external data, or complex logic involved. The code appears to be a typical setup for event signaling within a Django application. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard Django patterns suggest no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of Django signals with no malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation detected. It is safe and intended for typical application use.",
