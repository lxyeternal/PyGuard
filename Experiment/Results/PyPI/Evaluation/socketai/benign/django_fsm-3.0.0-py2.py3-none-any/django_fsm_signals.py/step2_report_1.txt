  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only defines two Django signals (`pre_transition` and `post_transition`) using `django.dispatch.Signal`.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no data processing, input/output, or dynamic behavior.\n   - No external data, secrets, or malicious constructs are present.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code does *not* contain any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is minimal, standard, and safe.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - **Note:** The reports are thorough and well-reasoned.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all assessments indicate no malicious activity, no security risk, and no obfuscation, risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and standard pattern.\n   - No overestimations are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nThe code is a standard Django signals setup with no security issues, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the findings.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
