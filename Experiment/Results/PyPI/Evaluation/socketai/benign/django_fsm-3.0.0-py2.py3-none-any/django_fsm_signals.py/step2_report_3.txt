  "review": "Let's review the provided reports and the original code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Confirmation**:\n   - The code simply imports Django's `Signal` class and defines two signal instances: `pre_transition` and `post_transition`.\n   - There are no external data inputs, no data processing, no handlers, no dynamic behavior, and no obfuscation.\n   - The code matches all descriptions in the reports.\n\n2. **Analysis of Reports**:\n   - All reports correctly identify this as a standard Django pattern for defining signals.\n   - No suspicious or malicious code patterns are mentioned.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or external data flows are present.\n   - The conclusions in all reports are consistent: the code is benign and typical.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware score**: All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate because there is no malicious activity or payload.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign `0`, which is correct given the straightforward code.\n   - **Security risk score**: All reports assign `0`. The code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities; it merely defines signals.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The confidence scores are all `1`, which seems reasonable given the straightforward nature.\n   - No changes are necessary to the scores or assessments.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is only defining signals, the security implications are minimal.\n   - There is no evidence of any hidden malicious intent or behavior.\n   - The reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the benign, standard Django signal definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a typical, safe pattern for defining signals in Django applications. All reports are consistent, and no modifications to the scores are necessary. The overall risk remains negligible, with no malware or obfuscation concerns.",
