  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:  \n   The code defines two Django signals: `pre_transition` and `post_transition`. It simply imports Django's `Signal` class and creates these two signal instances.  \n   **Issue presence**: The reports correctly state that the code only defines signals with no data processing, input/output, or complex logic. There are no hidden or malicious behaviors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions. They correctly identify that the code is minimal, standard, and free of suspicious patterns. No logical flaws or inaccuracies are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`. This aligns with the code's straightforward nature.  \n   **Recommendation**: The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely defining signals with no external input, no data handling, and no suspicious behavior, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The reports' low scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. There is no indication of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions. They stick to the facts: the code is standard Django signal definitions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risk present.\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, standard Django pattern for defining signals. It does not process external data, does not contain obfuscation, and does not perform any suspicious actions. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The current scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
