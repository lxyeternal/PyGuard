  "purpose": "Define Django signals for pre- and post-transition events",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; defines signal objects",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; simply creates signal objects",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; straightforward signal definitions",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's Signal class and defines two signal instances: pre_transition and post_transition. These are standard for Django applications to implement event hooks. No external data is read, no user input, no environment variables are accessed, and no suspicious or malicious code constructs are present. The code is minimal and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Django signals setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely establishes hooks for application logic to connect to, without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
