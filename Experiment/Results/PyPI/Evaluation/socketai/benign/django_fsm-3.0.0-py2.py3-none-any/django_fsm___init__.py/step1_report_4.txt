{
  "purpose": "The code implements state management and transition handling for Django models, including decorators, exceptions, and mixins to support finite state machines (FSM).",
  "sources": "Reads model field states via get_state methods, imports environment info (sys, django), reads user permissions, and inspects class methods for transition annotations.",
  "sinks": "Changes model states via set_state/set_proxy, potentially altering class types dynamically, and invokes transition methods which can execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Source: get_state/read field, method calls in transition decorators → sink: set_state/set_proxy/method execution → potential modification of model class or state.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic class reassignment in set_proxy; use of eval-like getattr and method inspection; dynamic import handling; no hardcoded secrets or obscure obfuscation detected; version-dependent code branching is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages FSM states within Django models, using decorators and mixins. It dynamically adjusts model classes with set_proxy, inspects methods for transition annotations, and handles state transitions with permission and condition checks. No evidence of malicious intent such as network access, data exfiltration, or system modification beyond model state management. The use of dynamic class change and reflection is standard for such FSM implementations, and no hardcoded credentials or suspicious external calls are present. The code includes deprecation warnings, Django version checks, and optional South support, which are typical for compatibility and maintenance.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an FSM framework for Django models, with no indications of malicious behavior. It performs state management, permission checks, and method annotations for transitions in a controlled manner. No malicious activity or sabotage evident. The use of dynamic class change and reflection is consistent with the intended functionality and does not raise suspicion.",
