  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code manages Django model FSMs, importing standard libs, Django modules, and django_fsm. It reads model fields, method attributes, and external modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses dynamic class modification (`instance.__class__ = model`) in `set_proxy`, which can be risky if proxies are untrusted. Transition signals are dispatched, which is standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No evidence of malicious activity; the dynamic class change is intended for model replacement based on state proxies. No external network, data exfiltration, or code injection observed.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate FSM implementation, no malware or backdoors. Dynamic class change is a potential risk if misused, but in normal use, it’s controlled.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to dynamic class change potential misuse)  \n\n**Recommendation:** The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar FSM management with transition validation, permission checks, concurrency control. Reads from method decorators, class attributes, instance states.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows through transition validation, state change methods, signals. No external data leakage or malicious code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. Uses standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard FSM framework, no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (standard low risk for such code)\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** FSM with transition validation, permission, concurrency. Reads from method parameters, instance attributes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** State changes via `set_state`, `set_proxy`, signals.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity, no external communication, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate FSM code, low security risk.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Recommendation:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** FSM with decorators, permission checks, dynamic class change (`instance.__class__ = model`), reflection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** State modification, class change, method invocation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity; class change is controlled within FSM logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard FSM with dynamic class change, no malicious intent.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** FSM with transition management, permission, concurrency safeguards. Reads from model instance and parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** State change, class modification, method execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, external communication, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate FSM code, low security risk.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is a standard FSM framework for Django, with dynamic class modification being a known pattern but not malicious.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0.2, reflecting the potential risk of dynamic class modification if misused, but generally low.\n\n### **Final judgment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, justified by dynamic class change, which could be risky if misused but is standard in such frameworks.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to dynamic class change potential misuse)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable in their scoring. No adjustments needed.",
