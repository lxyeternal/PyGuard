  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual behavior, potential security concerns, and the alignment of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a Django FSM framework, with dynamic class modifications and signals.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Notes potential risks in 'set_proxy' due to dynamic class change but considers this a standard pattern.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Finds no malicious activity; the dynamic class change could be misused if untrusted data is involved but is intended for model replacement.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes no malware or malicious intent, with high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — aligns with the analysis.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation observed.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — low, given the dynamic class change potential but standard use.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on transition validation and permission checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Highlights potential influence of untrusted data but finds no malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code; standard FSM implementation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states no malicious behavior, with high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — consistent.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern; focus on transition validation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or malicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code; dynamic class change is controlled.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — aligns.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focus on transition decorators and dynamic class modification.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leakage or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Dynamic class change is standard for FSM proxies; no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior, high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — consistent.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same core functionality.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of external communication or malicious code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of dynamic class change is controlled and typical for FSM proxies.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code's legitimate FSM management and controlled dynamic class modifications, a malware score of **0** is appropriate across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores of **0** are justified.\n- **Risk Score:** The only potential concern is the use of `instance.__class__ = model` in `set_proxy`, which could be misused if untrusted data influences the `state_proxy`. However, within typical controlled usage, this pattern is standard for FSM proxies. Therefore, a low risk score of **0.2** is appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity observed.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minor concern due to dynamic class change, but acceptable in controlled environments.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports' scoring is consistent with the code's behavior. The code is a legitimate FSM framework with controlled dynamic class modifications, permission checks, and signals, and shows no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
