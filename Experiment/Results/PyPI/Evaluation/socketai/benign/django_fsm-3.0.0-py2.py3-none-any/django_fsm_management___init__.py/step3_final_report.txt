  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code analysis, data flows, anomalies, and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, external data sources, network or file operations, system commands.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "From input sources (user input, environment variables) to sinks (network, file, system commands), potentially via data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected; code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence or benign nature of code, assigning malware=0 and obfuscated=0. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting typical external interactions but no malicious activity. Confidence levels are justified based on the lack of suspicious patterns or code snippets. No evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation is present. The assessments are consistent and well-justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is deemed safe with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The low security risk scores are appropriate given the context. All reports are consistent, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
