  "security_risk": 0.65,
  "obfuscated": 0.75,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate signs of malicious behavior, primarily driven by obfuscation and dynamic code execution patterns. While no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed, the suspicious indicators justify a moderate malware score (~0.55) and high obfuscation (~0.75). Benign reports correctly have low scores. Slight adjustments to malware suspicion in the most suspicious reports would improve accuracy. Overall, the dependency warrants cautious handling due to the obfuscation and suspicious patterns observed."
