The low risk associated with dynamic class modification is justified and manageable. Overall, the code is safe for use in production with standard precautions."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate signs of malicious behavior, primarily driven by obfuscation and dynamic code execution patterns. While no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed, the suspicious indicators justify a moderate malware score (~0.55) and high obfuscation (~0.75). Benign reports correctly have low scores. Slight adjustments to malware suspicion in the most suspicious reports would improve accuracy. Overall, the dependency warrants cautious handling due to the obfuscation and suspicious patterns observed."

      "confidence": 0.95,
      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for visualizing FSM transitions in Django models. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are justified, primarily reflecting potential resource misuse via user inputs, which is typical for CLI tools but not malicious. The malware score should be set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the overall security risk to approximately 0.2 to accurately reflect the low threat level."
