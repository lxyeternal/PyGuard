  "purpose": "This script generates GraphViz diagrams of FSM transitions for Django models, primarily for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads from Django models, model fields, and command-line arguments for specific apps/models/fields.",
  "sinks": "Calls graphviz to generate and render diagrams; writes output files if specified; prints diagrams to stdout.",
  "flows": "User input (command-line args) -> model and field selection -> generate_dot() -> graphviz rendering and output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no data exfiltration or backdoors detected; usage of standard Django APIs and graphviz.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Django and graphviz APIs to generate visual diagrams of model FSM transitions. It processes command-line arguments to select models and fields, then constructs directed graphs for visualization. No use of insecure code patterns, eval, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated or suspicious code features. It reads from model metadata and user input, and outputs diagrams either to file or stdout. The external libraries are common for Django projects, and no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for visualizing FSM transitions in Django models. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses standard APIs, handles user input safely, and has no suspicious network or data leaks.",
