  "purpose": "A Django management command that generates FSM transition diagrams for models with finite state machines, using model metadata and user-specified parameters.",
  "sources": "Model metadata (_meta), user command-line arguments for models/fields, transition definitions within FSM fields.",
  "sinks": "Output files in various formats (PNG, JPG, DOT), or printing DOT data to stdout.",
  "flows": "User inputs specify models/fields; code reads model metadata and transition info; outputs diagram files or text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external network activity detected. Usage of standard libraries and APIs is consistent with legitimate tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django management command for visualizing FSM transitions. It reads model metadata, processes user inputs for models and fields, and generates Graphviz diagrams. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external communication is present. The dynamic import handling for Django API compatibility is standard. The code does not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or execute malicious payloads. User input handling is typical for CLI tools and does not indicate malicious intent. The overall structure and dependencies are consistent with legitimate software.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for visualizing FSM transitions in Django models. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are justified, primarily reflecting potential resource misuse via user inputs, which is typical for CLI tools but not malicious. The malware score should be set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the overall security risk to approximately 0.2 to accurately reflect the low threat level.",
