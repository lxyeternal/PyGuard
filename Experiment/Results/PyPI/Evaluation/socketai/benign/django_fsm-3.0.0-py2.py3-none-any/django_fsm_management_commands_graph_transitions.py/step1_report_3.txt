  "purpose": "This script generates GraphViz diagrams representing state transitions for Django models with FSM fields, aiding visualization of model state flows.",
  "sources": "User-supplied arguments specifying app/model/field names, optional output filename, and layout preferences.",
  "sinks": "Graph rendering output, file writing, and potential use of external GraphViz binary for visualization.",
  "flows": "Input args -> model/field retrieval -> transition data extraction -> graph construction -> output rendering or display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily uses Django ORM APIs to retrieve model and field metadata, then constructs a directed graph representing FSM transitions using GraphViz. It accepts user arguments to specify models or app models, and output options. No external data is fetched or transmitted. The code appears to be a standard visualization tool without malicious intent, with all external interactions confined to the filesystem or local GraphViz commands. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Django management command for visualizing FSM transitions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on user input for models and output options and does not perform any external network operations or data leaks.",
