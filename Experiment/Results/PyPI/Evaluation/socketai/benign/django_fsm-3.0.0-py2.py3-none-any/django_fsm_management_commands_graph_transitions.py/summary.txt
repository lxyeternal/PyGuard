  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for visualizing FSM transitions in Django models. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are justified, primarily reflecting potential resource misuse via user inputs, which is typical for CLI tools but not malicious. The malware score should be set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the overall security risk to approximately 0.2 to accurately reflect the low threat level."
