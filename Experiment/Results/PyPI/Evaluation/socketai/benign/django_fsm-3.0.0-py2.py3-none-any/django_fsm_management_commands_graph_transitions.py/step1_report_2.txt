{
  "purpose": "The script generates GraphViz visualizations of finite state machine (FSM) transitions within Django models, for debugging or documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input args (model and field specifications via command-line arguments), environment variables (Django settings), and package imports.",
  "sinks": "File rendering outputs, graphviz rendering engine, print statements, and potentially network-based rendering if misconfigured (not explicitly in code).",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> model/field data retrieval -> FSM transition data -> graph construction -> output rendering or print.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of external libraries (graphviz) appears standard for visualization. No data leakage, no malicious network activity, no hidden backdoors or code injections identified.",
  "analysis": "The code parses command-line arguments to specify models and fields, then extracts FSM transition data from Django models, generating a GraphViz DOT diagram. It utilizes Django's ORM and model meta APIs, with fallback handling for different Django versions. The script writes output to files or prints to console. No external network communication, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. All external library usage (graphviz) is standard. The code structure is straightforward, focusing on visualization of FSMs without any suspicious dynamic code execution or hidden functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Django management command designed for visualizing FSM transitions. No malicious behavior or malicious payloads are evident. It simply processes model data and generates visualization files, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
