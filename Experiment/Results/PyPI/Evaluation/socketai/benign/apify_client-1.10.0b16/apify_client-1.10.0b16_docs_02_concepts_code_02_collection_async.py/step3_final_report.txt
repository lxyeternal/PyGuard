{
  "purpose": "This code initializes an asynchronous Apify client with a hardcoded API token, creates an actor named 'my-actor', and lists all actors associated with the account.",
  "sources": "The hardcoded API token 'MY-APIFY-TOKEN' used during client initialization.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input or data; it interacts with the Apify API using a static token.",
  "flows": "The token is used as a parameter during client creation, enabling subsequent API calls like creating and listing actors.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded API token, which is a security concern but not malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API interactions with no signs of malicious behavior. The main security issue is the hardcoded credential, which could lead to credential exposure if shared or published. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious activity. The security risk score is moderate (~0.3-0.4) due to insecure credential handling. The code structure is straightforward and correct.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate API interaction code with a security concern stemming from hardcoded credentials. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
