{
  "purpose": "The code interacts with the Apify API to create and list actors.",
  "sources": "The code reads the API token from a hardcoded string variable 'TOKEN'.",
  "sinks": "The code uses the TOKEN variable to authenticate API requests; potential risk if the token is sensitive.",
  "flows": "The TOKEN variable flows directly into the ApifyClient constructor, enabling authenticated API interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The API token is hardcoded as plain text within the script, which is insecure. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the ApifyClient, sets a hardcoded API token, initializes a client, creates an actor named 'my-actor', and lists existing actors. The main concern is the hardcoded API token, which can lead to credential leakage if the code is shared or stored insecurely. The rest of the code appears to be straightforward API usage without malicious behavior. No suspicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary security concern is the hardcoded API token, which should be secured via environment variables or secure storage. The rest of the code does not demonstrate malicious behavior or malware. Overall, the code appears benign but insecure due to credential handling.",
