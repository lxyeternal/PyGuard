{
  "purpose": "The code interacts with the Apify API to create and list actors, using a hardcoded API token for authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads the API token from the hardcoded string 'MY-APIFY-TOKEN'.",
  "sinks": "API calls to Apify service which could expose the token if logs or errors are mishandled.",
  "flows": "Token is used as an argument to initialize ApifyClient, then for creating and listing actors.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded API token in plain text, which is insecure and a best practice violation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward API interactions without malicious commands or obfuscation. The main security concern is the hardcoded credential, which could lead to unauthorized access if exposed. No malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3) are consistent with the code's behavior. The code itself is benign but insecure due to credential handling. The risk score appropriately reflects the moderate security concern from credential exposure. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in functionality but insecure because of the hardcoded API token. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. The primary recommendation is to avoid hardcoding credentials and instead use environment variables or secure storage. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected.",
