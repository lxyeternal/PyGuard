{
  "purpose": "The code interacts with the Apify platform to start an actor and stream its logs asynchronously.",
  "sources": "The code reads the TOKEN constant for authentication and retrieves run data from the Apify API, including logs.",
  "sinks": "The print(line) statement outputs log lines to standard output, which could potentially leak sensitive information if logs contain secrets.",
  "flows": "The TOKEN and run ID are used to authenticate and retrieve logs; log lines are streamed and printed, possibly exposing logs containing sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets besides the TOKEN string, which is a placeholder. No suspicious behavior detected. The TOKEN appears to be a placeholder, not actual secret data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports asyncio and an async client for Apify, defines a constant TOKEN (placeholder), and asynchronously starts an Apify actor, then streams its logs. It uses asynchronous context managers and iteration correctly. There are no indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The use of print for logs is standard, but if logs contain secrets, this could leak data. The code does not handle secrets securely, but no actual secrets are embedded in the current code. Overall, the code seems to serve a legitimate purpose and contains no malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, legitimate implementation to start an Apify actor and stream logs asynchronously. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this snippet. The only concern is the potential exposure of sensitive log data if logs contain secrets, but that is a typical behavior rather than malicious activity.",
