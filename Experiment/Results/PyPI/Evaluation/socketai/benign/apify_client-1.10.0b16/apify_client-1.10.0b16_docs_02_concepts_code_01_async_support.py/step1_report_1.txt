{
  "purpose": "The code asynchronously interacts with the Apify platform to start an actor and stream its logs.",
  "sources": "Token 'MY-APIFY-TOKEN' is hardcoded; user input is not directly read from external sources.",
  "sinks": "The token is used to authenticate API requests; logs are printed to stdout.",
  "flows": "TOKEN -> ApifyClientAsync -> actor('my-actor-id') -> start() -> run ID -> run logs stream -> print to stdout",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded API token; no input validation; no suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an asynchronous Apify client with a hardcoded token, starts an actor with a specified ID, and streams logs, printing each log line. No obfuscated code, malicious functions, or unusual data flows are present. The use of a hardcoded token poses security concerns but does not indicate malicious intent. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are detected within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard API interaction with the Apify platform to run an actor and stream logs. The primary security concern is the hardcoded API token, which could lead to credential leakage if shared or exposed. No malicious behavior or sabotage evident.",
