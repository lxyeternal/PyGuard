{
  "purpose": "This code interacts with the Apify platform to start an actor and stream its logs asynchronously.",
  "sources": "The code reads the TOKEN string, the actor ID 'my-actor-id', and data from the async log stream.",
  "sinks": "The async log stream outputs data to the console via print().",
  "flows": "Input token and actor ID -> initialize ApifyClientAsync -> start actor -> obtain run ID -> stream logs -> print logs.",
  "anomalies": "The TOKEN is hard-coded as 'MY-APIFY-TOKEN', which could be a placeholder but might also indicate insecure credential management if used in production. No other suspicious code structures or obfuscated parts are present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses the Apify SDK to manage actors asynchronously. It securely initiates an actor run and streams logs without processing or transmitting data elsewhere. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, command execution, or suspicious network activity are evident. The only notable concern is the hardcoded token, which should ideally be stored securely (e.g., environment variable). The code structure appears straightforward and intended for legitimate use cases.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for managing Apify actors asynchronously and streaming logs. No malicious behavior or malware indicators are present. The main security consideration is the hardcoded token, which could pose risks if misused, but it does not indicate malicious intent.",
