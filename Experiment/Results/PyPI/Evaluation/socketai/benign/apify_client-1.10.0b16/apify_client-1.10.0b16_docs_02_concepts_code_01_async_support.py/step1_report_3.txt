{
  "purpose": "The code interacts with the Apify platform to start an actor, monitor its logs, and output them, likely for automation or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads the TOKEN string for authentication; reads data from the async log stream of the actor run.",
  "sinks": "Outputs log lines to the console; potential for log data leakage if logs contain sensitive info.",
  "flows": "TOKEN is used as an input to instantiate ApifyClientAsync -> actor ID is used to start an actor -> actor run ID is used to access logs -> logs are streamed and printed.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded API token ('MY-APIFY-TOKEN') is a security concern, potentially exposing credentials if code is shared or stored insecurely. No other suspicious code or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely uses asyncio and the Apify SDK to manage actor execution and log streaming. The main concern is the hardcoded API token, which could lead to credential leakage if the code is exposed publicly. The code itself performs standard API interactions without malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or system modification. No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The code's structure and logic are straightforward and aligned with typical use of the Apify SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate script for automating actor execution and log streaming on Apify. The primary security concern is the hardcoded API token, which should be managed securely (e.g., environment variables). There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. Overall risk is low, with a notable security warning regarding credential management.",
