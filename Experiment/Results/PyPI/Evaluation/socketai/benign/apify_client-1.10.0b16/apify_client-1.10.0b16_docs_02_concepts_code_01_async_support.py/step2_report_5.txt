  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, interacts with the Apify platform to start an actor, and streams logs.\n- The primary concern across reports is the hardcoded API token `'MY-APIFY-TOKEN'`.\n- No reports identify malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are around 0.2–0.3, mainly due to credential management issues.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- The code **does not** contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware.\n- The token `'MY-APIFY-TOKEN'` is a placeholder; in real use, it would be a secret. The code itself doesn't leak or exfiltrate data.\n- The code is correct and functions as intended for API interaction.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n\n- The reports correctly identify the hardcoded token as a security concern but do not consider it malicious.\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the risks; they correctly note that no malicious activity is present.\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified; no malicious code or behavior is detected.\n- **Security risk:** The scores of 0.2–0.3 are reasonable, reflecting credential management concerns without indicating malicious intent.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk > 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- The main risk is the hardcoded token, which could lead to credential leakage if exposed, but this alone isn't malicious.\n\n### Consistency and suggestions:\n\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- The scores seem reasonable given the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** approximately 0.2–0.3, mainly due to credential handling.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — the only concern is credential management, not malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a legitimate, straightforward script for interacting with the Apify platform. The primary security concern is the hardcoded token, which should be managed securely, but there is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage.",
