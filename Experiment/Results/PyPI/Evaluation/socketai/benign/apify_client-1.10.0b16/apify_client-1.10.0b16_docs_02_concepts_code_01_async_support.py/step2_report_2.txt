  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the code and reasoning:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code interacts with the Apify platform asynchronously, starting an actor and streaming logs.\n   - The code as provided does not contain obfuscated or malicious code segments.\n   - The only notable concern is the hardcoded API token, which is a security best practice violation but not an indicator of malicious intent.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the security concern of the hardcoded token.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The reasoning that the code performs legitimate API interactions without malicious behavior is sound.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` score: 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity.\n     - `obfuscated` score: 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n     - `securityRisk`: mostly 0.2-0.3, reflecting the security concern about hardcoded credentials, which is reasonable.\n   - The confidence levels are high (0.8-0.9), aligning with the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No scores above 0.5 are assigned, which is appropriate.\n   - The only concern is the hardcoded token, which is a security vulnerability but not malicious.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they treat the code as legitimate with a security concern about credential management.\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities are based on unsupported assumptions.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and with the analysis provided.\n\n**Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2–0.3 — The primary concern is credential security (hardcoded token). While this is a security vulnerability, it does not constitute a high risk of exploitation by itself unless the token is leaked.\n\n**Overall Recommendation:**\n\n- The code is benign and performs legitimate API interactions.\n- The security concern is the hardcoded token, which should be replaced with environment variables or secure storage.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Suggested Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware            | 0               |\n| Obfuscated         | 0               |\n| Security Risk      | 0.2–0.3         |\n\nThis reflects a low overall threat level with a notable security best practice violation regarding credential management.",
