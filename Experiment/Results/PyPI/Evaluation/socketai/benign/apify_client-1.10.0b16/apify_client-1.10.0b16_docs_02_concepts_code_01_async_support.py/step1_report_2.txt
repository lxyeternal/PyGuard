{
  "purpose": "The code interacts with the Apify platform to start an actor and stream its logs asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Reads the hardcoded API token 'MY-APIFY-TOKEN' and the actor ID 'my-actor-id'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially logs sensitive information if the token or logs are exposed or mishandled.",
  "flows": "Token and actor ID are used to initialize the client; then the actor is started, and logs are streamed, which could expose logs or token if output is insecure.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a hardcoded API token ('MY-APIFY-TOKEN') which could be sensitive. No other suspicious or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports asyncio for asynchronous operations and the ApifyClientAsync for interacting with Apify's API. It stores an API token directly in the script, which is a security concern as it exposes sensitive credentials. The main function initializes the client, starts an actor with a specified ID, retrieves the run, and streams logs asynchronously. The flow is straightforward and consistent with intended API usage. No malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior are evident. The primary concern is the hardcoded token, which could lead to credential leakage if shared or exposed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate script for interacting with the Apify platform, with no evidence of malicious intent. The main risk is the hardcoded API token, which is a security vulnerability but not malicious by itself.",
