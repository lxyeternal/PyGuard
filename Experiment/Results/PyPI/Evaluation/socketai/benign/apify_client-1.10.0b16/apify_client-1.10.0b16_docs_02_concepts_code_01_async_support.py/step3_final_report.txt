{
  "purpose": "The code initializes an asynchronous Apify client with a hardcoded token, starts an actor, retrieves its run ID, and streams logs asynchronously, printing each line.",
  "sources": "The hardcoded token 'MY-APIFY-TOKEN' used for authentication; the actor ID 'my-actor-id' used to start the actor.",
  "sinks": "Printing logs to stdout; no data is transmitted externally or stored insecurely within the code.",
  "flows": "The token is used as a source for authentication when creating the ApifyClientAsync instance; the actor's start method triggers a run, whose ID is used to retrieve logs, which are then streamed and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The only notable anomaly is the hardcoded API token, which is a security concern but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing standard API interactions with Apify. It uses a hardcoded token, which is a security best practice violation but not an indicator of malicious intent. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The logs are streamed and printed locally, with no suspicious data flows. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3 due to credential exposure. The code's structure and behavior are consistent with legitimate use, and no anomalies suggest malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for interacting with the Apify platform asynchronously. The primary security concern is the hardcoded API token, which should be replaced with environment variables or secure storage. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware.",
