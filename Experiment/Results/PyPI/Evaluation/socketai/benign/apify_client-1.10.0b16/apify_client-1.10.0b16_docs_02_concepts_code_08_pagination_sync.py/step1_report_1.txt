{
  "purpose": "To fetch all items from a specified Apify dataset using pagination.",
  "sources": "The dataset ID 'dataset-id' and the ApifyClient instantiation with a token.",
  "sinks": "The response from 'dataset_client.list_items', which could potentially be used for data extraction or exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input token and dataset ID → Initialize client → Loop fetching items via 'list_items' → Aggregate items in 'all_items' list.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded token ('MY-APIFY-TOKEN'), which indicates sensitive credential exposure. No other suspicious code or behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly initializes an Apify client with a hardcoded token, then paginates through dataset items using limit and offset. It fetches all items into a list and prints progress. The hardcoded token is a security concern as it could be misused if exposed. No malicious or obfuscated behavior, no data leaks or backdoors present. The data fetching process appears standard and does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary function is to retrieve dataset items from Apify. The only notable security concern is the hardcoded API token, which could lead to credential exposure if the code is shared or compromised. No malicious intent or malware indications are present.",
