  "conclusion": "The script is benign with respect to malware and obfuscation. The primary security risk stems from the hardcoded API token, which should be stored securely. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The scores assigned in reports are appropriate; a risk score of approximately 0.3 reflects the credential exposure concern."
