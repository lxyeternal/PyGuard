  "purpose": "To interact with the Apify platform API for managing and starting actor runs.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded API token ('MY-APIFY-TOKEN') from a string assignment.",
  "sinks": "The token is used in API client initialization; potential risk if token is compromised, but no data exfiltration or malicious command execution is evident.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded token (source) is used in creating the API client (sink), enabling authenticated API requests.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded API token in the source code, which can be a security concern if exposed or misused.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a client library for Apify, defines a string token directly in code, then creates an API client using this token. It proceeds to retrieve a specific actor by ID and starts a run of this actor. No malicious code, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The only notable issue is the hardcoded token, which can be considered a security risk if the code is shared or exposed publicly. The code itself performs legitimate API operations without any suspicious or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard API interactions with Apify. The main concern is the hardcoded API token, which could lead to unauthorized access if the code is compromised. No malware or malicious intent is detected. Overall security risk is low, but best practices recommend storing tokens securely rather than hardcoding.",
