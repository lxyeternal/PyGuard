  "purpose": "Initialize an Apify client with a hardcoded token, retrieve an actor, and start its run.",
  "sources": "The hardcoded token 'MY-APIFY-TOKEN' used to instantiate ApifyClient.",
  "sinks": "API calls to retrieve and start the actor; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Token is used directly in client initialization; no external input flows into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded credential; no other suspicious or unusual code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward API interactions with no obfuscation or malicious logic. The primary security concern is the hardcoded token, which could lead to credential exposure if compromised. No malware, backdoors, or malicious activities are evident. The code does not process untrusted input or perform unsafe operations. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and standard. The security risk score is moderate (~0.3), reflecting the credential management issue but not active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs legitimate API interactions. The main security concern is the hardcoded credential, which should be managed securely. No malware or malicious activity is present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
