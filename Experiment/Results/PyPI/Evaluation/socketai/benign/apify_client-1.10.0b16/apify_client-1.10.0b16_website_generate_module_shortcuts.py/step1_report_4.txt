{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to traverse specific Python modules ('apify', 'apify_client', 'apify_shared') to identify class shortcuts and resolve their references, then save these mappings into a JSON file.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules 'apify', 'apify_client', and 'apify_shared', and reads the 'module_shortcuts.json' file for writing output.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data into 'module_shortcuts.json' file. No other sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Modules are imported, classes are inspected, shortcut mappings are created and resolved, then written to a file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are detected. The code's logic is straightforward, involving module inspection and JSON output.",
  "analysis": "The script systematically imports specific modules, inspects their classes, creates shortcut mappings, and resolves references. It handles missing modules gracefully. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The purpose appears to be organizing module class references. No obfuscation, encryption, or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign function of collecting and resolving module class shortcuts and saving them to a JSON file. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
