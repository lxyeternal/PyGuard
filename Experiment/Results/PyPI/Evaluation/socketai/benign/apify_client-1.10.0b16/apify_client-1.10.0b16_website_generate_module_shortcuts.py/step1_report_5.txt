{
  "purpose": "The script traverses specified Python modules to identify class shortcuts and resolves linked shortcuts, then saves the resulting mapping to a JSON file.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules ('apify', 'apify_client', 'apify_shared'), inspects their classes and submodules, and reads the module attributes.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to 'module_shortcuts.json' file on disk.",
  "flows": "Module imports -> class inspection -> shortcut resolution -> JSON file writing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns are present. The code appears straightforward, focusing on module inspection and file output.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically imports modules, inspects their classes and submodules for shortcuts, resolves chained shortcuts, and writes the resulting dictionary to a JSON file. No external data is fetched or transmitted over the network, and no user input handling or environment variable usage is present. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, command execution, or system modifications. The approach is methodical and does not include any suspicious constructs. The only potential concern is the writing of a JSON file, but this is a benign operation in this context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, focusing solely on module introspection and data serialization without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
