{
  "purpose": "The code asynchronously interacts with the Apify platform to run an actor and retrieve its dataset results.",
  "sources": "The code reads an API token ('MY-APIFY-TOKEN'), actor ID ('john-doe/my-cool-actor'), and dataset ID from the actor's call result.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data to the console using print statements, which could reveal sensitive data if the dataset contains confidential information.",
  "flows": "The API token is used to authenticate; then the actor is triggered, and upon completion, the dataset ID is used to fetch results, which are printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials (beyond the placeholder token), suspicious actor names, or unusual data handling are detected. The code uses async functions appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code securely uses an API token (though placeholder), calls a specific actor, and retrieves its dataset results. It does not include any suspicious or malicious code such as data exfiltration, malicious network requests, or backdoors. The dataset results are printed directly, which may leak sensitive data if present, but that is an expected behavior for data retrieval. The code structure and flow are typical for interacting with the Apify API, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, legitimate script for running an Apify actor and fetching results. No malicious behavior or security threats are evident. The use of a placeholder token should be replaced with secure handling in production, but this alone is not malicious.",
