{
  "purpose": "The code asynchronously interacts with the Apify platform to run an actor and retrieve its dataset results.",
  "sources": "Reads the API token ('MY-APIFY-TOKEN'), actor identifier, and actor call result data.",
  "sinks": "Uses the API token in the ApifyClientAsync constructor, fetches dataset items, and prints results.",
  "flows": "Input API token -> creates ApifyClientAsync -> starts actor call -> fetches dataset ID from call result -> retrieves dataset items.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded API token ('MY-APIFY-TOKEN'), which is a security risk if exposed; no validation or encryption of credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code securely uses an API token provided as a string, which is a common practice but can be risky if the token is hardcoded or exposed. The code asynchronously calls an Apify actor and retrieves dataset items, which is standard usage of the API. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious network activity is present. No data leakage, code injection, or unsafe data handling observed. The token should be stored securely, not hardcoded. The code structure is typical and does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard API interactions with Apify platform to run an actor and retrieve dataset data. The only potential security concern is the hardcoded API token, which should be managed securely. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware is detected.",
