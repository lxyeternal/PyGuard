{
  "purpose": "The code interacts with the Apify platform to trigger an actor run and retrieve dataset results asynchronously.",
  "sources": "The code reads the API token ('MY-APIFY-TOKEN') from a hardcoded string in the source code.",
  "sinks": "The code sends the API token to the ApifyClientAsync constructor, which then uses it for authentication; no other external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The hardcoded token is used to authenticate API requests; the actor ID is hardcoded; data is fetched from the Apify platform based on the actor call result.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded API token; no validation or obfuscation; use of asynchronous code is typical but not suspicious. No malicious or unusual code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an asynchronous client with a hardcoded API token, then calls a specific actor ('john-doe/my-cool-actor') on the Apify platform, waits for completion, and retrieves the dataset results. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious actions. The use of hardcoded credentials is a security concern but not necessarily malicious. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present. The flow appears straightforward and intended for legitimate API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard API interactions with Apify, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The primary concern is the hardcoded API token, which could lead to credential leakage if exposed. Overall, the code appears benign.",
