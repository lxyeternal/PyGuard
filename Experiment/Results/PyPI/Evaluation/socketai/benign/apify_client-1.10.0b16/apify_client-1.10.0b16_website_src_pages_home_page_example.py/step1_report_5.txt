{
  "purpose": "The code interacts with the Apify platform to trigger an actor run and retrieve dataset results asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Reads the Apify API token, actor ID, and dataset ID from API calls and variables; the token is hardcoded in the script.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to the console via print statements.",
  "flows": "Uses the token to authenticate, calls an actor, retrieves its dataset, and prints the results.",
  "anomalies": "The API token is hardcoded as 'MY-APIFY-TOKEN', which is insecure. No other suspicious code or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script asynchronously interacts with the Apify platform, starting an actor and retrieving its dataset. The token is hardcoded, which could be a security concern if this code is shared or stored insecurely. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, system modification, or backdoors. The code structure and logic are standard for API interactions. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward interaction with the Apify API for orchestrating actors and datasets. The main security concern is the hardcoded API token, which could be exploited if exposed. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent beyond that security issue.",
