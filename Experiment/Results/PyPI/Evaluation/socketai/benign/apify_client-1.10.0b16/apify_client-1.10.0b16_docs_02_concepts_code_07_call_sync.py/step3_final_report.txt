{
  "purpose": "The code initializes an ApifyClient with a hardcoded token, creates an actor client, and triggers actor runs via call() and start() methods.",
  "sources": "The hardcoded token 'MY-APIFY-TOKEN' used during ApifyClient initialization.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code interacts with an external API using SDK calls.",
  "flows": "The token is used as input during client creation; no further data flows are identified.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded API token, which is a security best practice violation but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no malicious logic or obfuscation. The main concern is the hardcoded token, which poses a security risk but does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code simply triggers actor runs on the Apify platform. The security risk score should reflect the credential handling issue, but malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious behavior. The primary security concern is the hardcoded token, which is a best practice violation but not an active threat. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The security risk score should be moderate (~0.2-0.3) due to credential handling. Overall, the code is safe but insecure in credential management.",
