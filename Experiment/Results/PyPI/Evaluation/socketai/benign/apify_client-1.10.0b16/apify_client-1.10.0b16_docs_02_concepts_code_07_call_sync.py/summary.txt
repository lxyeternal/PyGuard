  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious behavior. The primary security concern is the hardcoded token, which is a best practice violation but not an active threat. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The security risk score should be moderate (~0.2-0.3) due to credential handling. Overall, the code is safe but insecure in credential management."
