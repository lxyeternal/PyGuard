  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, using the Apify SDK to initiate actor runs.\n- The only technical concern is the hardcoded API token ('MY-APIFY-TOKEN'), which is a security best practice violation but not an indication of malicious activity.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports consistently note the security risk of hardcoded tokens but do not mention any actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n- They do not recognize any code patterns that suggest obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- The reasoning is sound: the code is simple, with no suspicious logic or external untrusted data handling.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- *Obfuscated:* All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n- *Malware:* All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- *Security Risk:* Scores are around 0.2-0.3, reflecting the concern about hardcoded credentials. This seems reasonable.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5. Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior, this is appropriate.\n- The primary risk is credential exposure, which is a security concern but not an active threat.\n\n**5. Malware Score Justification:**\n- All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or backdoor functions.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is benign but insecure due to hardcoded tokens.\n- No speculative claims about vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2–0.3 (due to hardcoded token)  \n\n**Overall Justification:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no malicious intent or behavior.\n- The only concern is the insecure handling of credentials, which warrants a low security risk score.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malware.\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is benign but insecure due to hardcoded credentials. It does not exhibit malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Maintain a low security risk score (~0.2–0.3), emphasizing best practices for credential management.",
