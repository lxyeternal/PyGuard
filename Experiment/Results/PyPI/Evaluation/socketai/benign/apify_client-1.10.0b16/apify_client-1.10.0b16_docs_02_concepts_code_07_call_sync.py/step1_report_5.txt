{
  "purpose": "The code initializes an ApifyClient with an API token, then interacts with a specific actor to run it, either waiting for completion or with a timeout.",
  "sources": "Reading the API token from a hardcoded string; calling methods to initiate actor runs.",
  "sinks": "Potential exposure of the API token if the code is shared or exposed, but no data leaks or external communications are explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "Use of the hardcoded TOKEN as input source; passing TOKEN to ApifyClient constructor; invoking actor_client.call() and actor_client.start() to trigger actor runs.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded API token ('MY-APIFY-TOKEN') which may be sensitive; no input validation or dynamic credential handling.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly creates an API client with a static token, which poses a security risk if the token is exposed or stored insecurely. The actor calls are standard API interactions with no suspicious or malicious behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity is evident. The main concern is the hardcoded token, which could be exploited if exposed. The code appears typical for orchestrating Apify actors and does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally benign and intended for managing Apify actors, but the hardcoded API token represents a security concern that should be addressed. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware.",
