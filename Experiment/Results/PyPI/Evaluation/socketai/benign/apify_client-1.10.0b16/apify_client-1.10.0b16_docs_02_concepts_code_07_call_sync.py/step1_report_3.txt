{
  "purpose": "The code initializes an ApifyClient with a token, then creates an actor client and runs an actor, either waiting for it to finish or with a timeout.",
  "sources": "The token string 'MY-APIFY-TOKEN', and the methods apify_client.actor() and actor_client.call() / actor_client.start()",
  "sinks": "The token could be used for authentication; the actor's execution may perform actions based on the actor's implementation, but no direct sinks like data exfiltration or system modification are evident",
  "flows": "The TOKEN is used to authenticate with Apify API, then the actor is called and started, leading to potential execution of remote code managed by the actor",
  "anomalies": "The token is hardcoded as 'MY-APIFY-TOKEN', which is a placeholder, but no actual secret or sensitive data is present; no suspicious or unusual code structures observed",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it uses a standard API client with a hardcoded token (placeholder). It creates an actor client and invokes actor runs, both of which depend on the actor's internal implementation. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leakage, or code injection. The token being hardcoded is a security concern in real-world usage, but not malicious by itself. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as network data exfiltration, file system manipulation, or privilege escalation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for running an Apify actor using the Python SDK. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, though the hardcoded token placeholder should be replaced with secure storage in production. Overall, it presents low security risk and no signs of sabotage.",
