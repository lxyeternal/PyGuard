  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code's purpose is to connect to Apify, retrieve logs, and print them.\n- The primary concern across all reports is the hardcoded API token ('MY-APIFY-TOKEN') and run ID ('MY-RUN-ID'), which pose security risks if the code is shared or exposed.\n- None of the reports identify any malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis that no malicious behavior is present.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating the code is not obfuscated.\n- The security risk scores vary from 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting the concern over hardcoded secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  The code matches the description in the reports. The token and run ID are hardcoded, which is insecure, but no other issues are evident. No anomalies or malicious code are present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the security concern (hardcoded secrets) but do not overstate the risk as malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware score (0): appropriate, as no malicious activity is detected.\n  - Obfuscated (0): appropriate.\n  - Security risk: scores between 0.2 and 0.4 seem reasonable given the insecure handling of credentials.\n\n- **Risk justification:**  \n  The main risk stems from embedding secrets directly in code, which could lead to credential exposure if the code is shared or stored insecurely. This is a serious security concern but not an active threat like malware.\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Correctly 0; no malware is present.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n  The reports do not assume vulnerabilities beyond insecure credential handling, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment and recommendations:\n\n- The code is benign but insecure due to hardcoded secrets.\n- No evidence of malicious activity or malware.\n- The security risk scores could be slightly adjusted upwards if considering the potential for credential leakage, but they are within a reasonable range.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.3 (average of the reports, reflecting moderate concern over credential handling)\n\n**Justification:**  \n- The code performs legitimate log streaming without malicious intent.  \n- The main issue is insecure credential management, which could lead to credential exposure if the code is shared or stored insecurely.  \n- No obfuscation or malware is present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is benign but insecure due to hardcoded secrets. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary beyond recognizing the security concern.",
