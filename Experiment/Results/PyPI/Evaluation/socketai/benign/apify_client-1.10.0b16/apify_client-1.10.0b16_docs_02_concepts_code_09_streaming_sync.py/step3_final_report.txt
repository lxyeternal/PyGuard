{
  "purpose": "The code initializes an ApifyClient with a hardcoded API token, retrieves a specific run, and streams logs to the console.",
  "sources": "The hardcoded TOKEN variable and the run ID string 'MY-RUN-ID'.",
  "sinks": "The log stream's iter_lines() method outputs data to stdout; no untrusted data is processed beyond this output.",
  "flows": "The TOKEN and run ID are used to authenticate and retrieve logs; logs are streamed and printed directly.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials (TOKEN and run ID), which pose security risks but do not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The main concern is the hardcoded API token and run ID, which could lead to credential exposure if the code is shared or compromised. No obfuscation or malicious intent is detected. The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious activity. The security risk score ranges from 0.2 to 0.4 across reports, appropriate given the insecure credential handling. The code's benign function and lack of malicious behavior justify these scores, though the insecure credential management should be addressed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs simple log streaming. The primary security concern is the hardcoded API token and run ID, which should be replaced with environment variables or secure storage. No malware or obfuscation is present. The overall security risk is low but warrants credential management improvements.",
