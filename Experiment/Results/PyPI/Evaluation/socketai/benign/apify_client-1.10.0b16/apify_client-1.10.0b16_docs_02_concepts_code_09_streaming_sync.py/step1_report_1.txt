{
  "purpose": "The code initializes an Apify client to access and stream logs from a specific run, likely for monitoring or debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded API token ('MY-APIFY-TOKEN') and a run ID ('MY-RUN-ID'), both of which are used to authenticate and specify the target run.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs log lines directly to standard output via print, but does not write or transmit data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The API token and run ID are used as inputs to authenticate and retrieve logs; these logs are then streamed and printed locally.",
  "anomalies": "The API token is hardcoded in plain text, which is a security concern. No other anomalies are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script uses the ApifyClient library to connect to a specific run's logs. The token is hardcoded, which risks accidental exposure. The log streaming is straightforward, with no apparent malicious operations. The code does not perform any data manipulation beyond streaming and printing logs, and it does not send or store sensitive data elsewhere. Overall, the code's functionality is benign but demonstrates insecure handling of credentials.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate log streaming from an external service but contains a security risk due to hardcoded API credentials. No malicious behavior is detected, but credential management should be improved.",
