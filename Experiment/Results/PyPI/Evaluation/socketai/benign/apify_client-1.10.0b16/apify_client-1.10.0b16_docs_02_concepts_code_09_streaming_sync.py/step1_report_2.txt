{
  "purpose": "The code initializes an Apify client with a token, retrieves a specific run, and streams its logs to the console.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded token ('MY-APIFY-TOKEN') and a run ID ('MY-RUN-ID') directly from the code; it also reads log data from the log stream returned by the ApifyClient.",
  "sinks": "The log data read from the log stream is printed to standard output (console).",
  "flows": "The hardcoded token and run ID serve as input sources; log stream data flows from the log stream object to the print statement, which outputs it.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials ('MY-APIFY-TOKEN') and run ID ('MY-RUN-ID'), which are sensitive data embedded directly in the code; the code simply streams logs and does not perform any malicious actions, but hardcoded secrets are a security concern.",
  "analysis": "The code uses the ApifyClient to connect to the Apify platform with a hardcoded API token, which could expose sensitive credentials if the code is shared or stored insecurely. It retrieves a specific run and streams its logs to the console. The log streaming mechanism appears normal and does not involve any malicious code or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or command execution. The primary concern is the insecure embedding of secrets. No suspicious or malicious actions are detected beyond the insecure handling of credentials.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior but contains a security risk due to hardcoded credentials, which could be exploited if the code is accessed by unauthorized parties. It is recommended to store secrets securely (e.g., environment variables) rather than embedding them directly in the code.",
