  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is straightforward: it initializes an ApifyClient with a hardcoded token, retrieves a specific run, and streams logs to the console.\n- No malicious code, suspicious network activity, or data exfiltration is evident.\n- The main security concern is the hardcoded API token and run ID, which are sensitive and could be exploited if exposed.\n- All reports agree on these points, with no claims of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- **Presence of hardcoded credentials** (`TOKEN` and `MY-RUN-ID`) in all reports.\n- **No evidence of malicious activity** such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n- **Functionality is benign**, primarily log streaming.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n\n- The reports correctly identify the security risk of hardcoded secrets but do not attribute any malicious behavior.\n- The scoring of `malware` as 0 in all reports aligns with the code's behavior—no malware detected.\n- The `securityRisk` scores vary slightly but are generally low, reflecting the concern over hardcoded secrets.\n\n### Score assessments:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting security concerns primarily due to hardcoded secrets.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nThe scores seem reasonable. Since the main issue is credential management, a higher security risk score (e.g., 0.4) could be justified if the code were in production, but as a simple snippet, the current scores are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for higher-than-0.5 risk scores:\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.4, which is appropriate because:\n  - The code does not perform malicious actions.\n  - The security concern is primarily about credential exposure, not active malicious behavior.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)  \n**Risk score:** 0.2–0.4 (due to hardcoded secrets)\n\n---\n\n### Additional critical points:\n\n- **Potential assumptions:** Some reports imply that hardcoded secrets could lead to malicious activity if leaked. While true, the code itself does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **No suspicious behavior:** The code does not perform data exfiltration, command execution, or network manipulation beyond log streaming.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- The code is benign in function but insecure in credential handling.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- The main recommendation is to avoid hardcoding secrets—use environment variables or secure storage.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n| Metric          | Score  | Justification                                               |\n|-----------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0       | No malicious activity detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0       | Code is straightforward, not obfuscated.                     |\n| Security Risk   | 0.3–0.4 | Due to hardcoded credentials, which pose a security concern. |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is functionally simple, with no malware or malicious intent. The main concern is insecure credential management, which should be addressed but does not elevate the code to a malicious or high-risk level.",
