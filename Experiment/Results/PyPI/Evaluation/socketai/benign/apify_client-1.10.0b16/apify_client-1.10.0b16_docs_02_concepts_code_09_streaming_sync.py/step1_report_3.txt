{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to connect to the Apify platform using a provided API token, access a specific run, and stream its logs to the console.",
  "sources": "The code reads the API token from a hardcoded string, and retrieves logs from the Apify platform via the run client.",
  "sinks": "The log stream output is printed directly to the console; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The API token and run ID serve as input sources; logs are retrieved from the API and printed; no untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks like network, file, or environment modifications.",
  "anomalies": "The API token ('MY-APIFY-TOKEN') and run ID ('MY-RUN-ID') are hardcoded placeholders, indicating potential risk if replaced with real secrets, but no malicious behavior is present. The code structure is straightforward and typical for API log streaming.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific client library for Apify, initializes it with a hardcoded token, and accesses logs for a specified run ID. It then streams log lines and prints them. There are no indications of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network communications. The hardcoded token is a potential security concern if replaced with real secrets, but it does not constitute malicious behavior by itself. No code injection, unsafe data handling, or suspicious operations are present. The code is simple and focused on log retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward API log streaming operation without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The main concern is the use of hardcoded API credentials, which could pose a security risk if actual secrets are embedded. Overall, the code is benign but should avoid hardcoding secrets in production environments.",
