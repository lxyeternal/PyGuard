{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to interact with the Apify platform API to retrieve and stream logs for a specific run.",
  "sources": "The code reads the API token from a hardcoded string 'MY-APIFY-TOKEN'. It also reads the run ID from a hardcoded string 'MY-RUN-ID'. It reads data from the log stream provided by the Apify API.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs log lines to the standard output (print). The only potential data leak here would be if the logs contain sensitive information, but the code itself does not explicitly leak data outside the process.",
  "flows": "The code uses hardcoded credentials and run ID as sources. These are used to authenticate and retrieve logs, which are then streamed and printed to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded API token and run ID represent security risks, as they could be exposed if the code is shared or stored insecurely. The code accesses external services, but does not appear to perform malicious actions like data exfiltration or backdoor functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the ApifyClient library and uses a static token and run ID to initialize a client object. It retrieves a run object and accesses its log stream. It then streams log lines and prints them. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident in the code logic itself. The main concern is the use of hardcoded sensitive data, which is a security weakness but not malicious. The log streaming and printing are straightforward operations without any data manipulation or external data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a log retrieval tool from the Apify platform, with no malicious intent detected. The primary security concern is the hardcoded API token and run ID, which could lead to credential exposure if compromised. Overall, the code appears benign and does not contain malware or malicious behaviors.",
