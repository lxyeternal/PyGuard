{
  "purpose": "The code initializes an Apify client with a token, retrieves a specific run, and streams its logs to the console.",
  "sources": "The TOKEN variable contains an API token; the code reads data from the log stream of a run.",
  "sinks": "The log stream data is printed to the console; the token is used for authenticated API requests.",
  "flows": "The TOKEN is used to authenticate, then log data is read from the stream and outputted directly.",
  "anomalies": "The API token is hardcoded as a plain string, which is insecure; no input validation or environment variable usage; no unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly uses the Apify SDK to access run logs. The token is hardcoded, which poses a security risk, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior like data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious network activity. The log stream is printed directly, which is typical for log output. No obfuscated or malicious code segments are present. The script's functionality is standard for log retrieval and display.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate operations to access and display logs from a specific Apify run. The primary concern is the hardcoded API token, which could be exploited if leaked, but there is no malicious intent or behavior evident within this code snippet.",
