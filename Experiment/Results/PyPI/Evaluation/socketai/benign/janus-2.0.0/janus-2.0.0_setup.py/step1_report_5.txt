  "purpose": "To configure and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for package setup; no unusual or suspicious code structures, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports the setup function from setuptools and calls it with default parameters. This is a common pattern in Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden code, or suspicious activities. The code does not process input, access environment variables, or perform network operations.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward package setup invocation with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The code is benign and standard for Python package distribution.",
