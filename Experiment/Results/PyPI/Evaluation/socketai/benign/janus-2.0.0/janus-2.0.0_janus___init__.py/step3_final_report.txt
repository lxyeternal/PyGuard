{
  "purpose": "A comprehensive, asyncio-compatible, thread-safe queue system supporting sync and async operations, with variants such as priority and LIFO queues.",
  "sources": "Internal data structures (deque, heapq), configuration parameters, shutdown flags, and condition variables for synchronization.",
  "sinks": "No external untrusted data sources or network activity; data flows are confined within internal queue management.",
  "flows": "Data is enqueued and dequeued through internal methods; shutdown signals propagate via condition notifications; no external data flow or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Shutdown and notification mechanisms behave as expected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a multi-protocol queue supporting threading and asyncio, with proper synchronization primitives. It manages shutdowns gracefully, supports task tracking, and provides variants like priority and LIFO queues. No external data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The concurrency management is complex but standard, with no signs of malicious intent. The malware score is justified as 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the code's utility nature and robust design.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured, multi-variant queue implementation supporting both synchronous and asynchronous operations. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage indicators. The security assessment confirms it is safe for use in production environments.",
