  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for building and installing the cx_Logging Python extension, managing platform-specific build steps, copying headers and libraries, and configuring build options.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'VERSION', source files 'src/cx_Logging.c', header dependencies 'src/cx_Logging.h', and platform-specific environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Copies header files to include directory, copies built library files to lib directory, and sets build options based on platform.",
  "flows": "Reads version from file -> configures build options -> compiles source -> copies headers and libraries during install.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected. Platform-specific handling is standard for build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard build and installation procedures for a Python C extension, with platform-aware logic for Windows and Unix-like systems. It reads version info, manages build options, copies necessary files, and sets macros. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The logic is straightforward and adheres to common practices for such build scripts. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for building a Python extension module. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified by the platform-specific build handling but does not indicate any threat.",
