  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes a standard build script for a Python C extension, reading version info, source files, and platform info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Copies header and library files during installation; no suspicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. Logic is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, typical setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.2 (slightly above zero, but justified by potential platform-specific build complexities). Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on cross-platform build logic and file copying.\n- No suspicious activity or malicious behavior detected.\n- Scores: Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1, Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on build and install steps, platform-aware logic, and file copying.\n- No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- Scores: Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1, Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Describes standard build and install procedures, platform-specific handling, and file management.\n- No suspicious activity or malicious intent.\n- Scores: Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0, Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar analysis, platform-aware build logic, and file operations.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- Scores: Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1, Confidence: 0.9.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None. All reports correctly identify the code as a standard build script.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code detected.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports, consistent with the code's functionality.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), justified by the complexity of cross-platform build logic, but not indicative of actual security issues.\n- **Confidence levels:** High (0.9-1), given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python C extension.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The minor security risk scores are appropriate given the complexity but do not indicate actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, related to build complexity, not security issues)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the code is benign. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The setup script is safe, with no security concerns.",
