  "purpose": "Multithreaded directory listing and logging for testing or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, os.listdir('.')",
  "sinks": "Logs written to 'test_threading.log' via cx_Logging",
  "flows": "Command-line args → threads → directory listing → logs",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom 'cx_Logging' module without provided implementation; no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code initializes thread and iteration counts from command-line args, then spawns multiple threads executing 'run()'. Each thread logs its start, then in a loop counts files in the current directory and logs the count and remaining iterations. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The use of a custom logging module 'cx_Logging' is noted but not evidenced as malicious. The code is straightforward, benign, and appears intended for testing or monitoring. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign multithreaded directory monitoring script with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The use of an external logging library warrants verification in a real scenario, but based on the code alone, it is not malicious. The scores and assessments provided are appropriate and consistent.",
