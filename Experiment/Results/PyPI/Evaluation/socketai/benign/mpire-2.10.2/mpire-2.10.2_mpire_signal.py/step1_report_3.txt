  "purpose": "Provide context managers to delay or disable handling of keyboard interrupt signals (SIGINT) in Python programs, primarily for use in multi-threaded environments.",
  "sources": "Reading current thread information (current_thread, main_thread), signal handling functions (getsignal, signal_), and signal constants (SIGINT, SIG_IGN, Signals).",
  "sinks": "Signal handler modifications (signal_(SIGINT, ...)), signal restoration (signal_(SIGINT, ...)), and setting signal handlers to ignore (signal_(SIGINT, SIG_IGN)).",
  "flows": "The code captures existing signal handlers, temporarily overrides SIGINT handling during context, then restores original handlers upon exit.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Functions directly modify signal handling in a controlled manner.",
  "analysis": "The code defines context managers for delaying or disabling SIGINT handling, suitable for multi-threaded environments. It captures current thread info, saves existing handlers, and temporarily overrides them with custom or ignore handlers. Upon exit, it restores original handlers. The implementation is straightforward, with proper checks to only modify handlers in the main thread. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or malicious side effects are apparent. The code solely manages signal behavior for clean interruption handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate utility for managing SIGINT signals in multi-threaded Python applications. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. The purpose is to enhance control over keyboard interrupts during critical sections.",
