  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing SIGINT signals, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (0.1) is justified due to the potential impact of signal handling on process control but is acceptable given the controlled implementation. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero, indicating no malicious or obfuscated code."
