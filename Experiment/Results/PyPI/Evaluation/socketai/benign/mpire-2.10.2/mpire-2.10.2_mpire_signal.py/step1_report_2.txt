{
  "purpose": "Manage and temporarily disable or delay handling of keyboard interrupt signals (SIGINT) in a controlled manner, primarily to prevent interruption during critical code execution.",
  "sources": "Reads the SIGINT signal using getsignal(SIGINT); detects the current thread with current_thread(); reads and stores signal handlers with getsignal(); sets new handlers with signal_(SIGINT, ...).",
  "sinks": "Sets signal handlers for SIGINT which can influence process termination or interruption; calls ignore_keyboard_interrupt() to ignore SIGINT, potentially preventing program termination.",
  "flows": "During __enter__, the code stores current signal handler and may replace it with a custom handler or ignore; during __exit__, it restores the original handler. When ignore_keyboard_interrupt() is called, SIGINT is set to ignore, potentially blocking user interruption.",
  "anomalies": "The code redefines and manages SIGINT signals but does not contain any suspicious or malicious code. It carefully handles signal states without hardcoded credentials or hidden code. No obfuscation or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides mechanisms to delay or ignore keyboard interrupts using signal handling. It checks for main thread context before modifying signals, ensuring proper behavior. The functions are straightforward, managing signal handlers with no hidden or malicious intent. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious actions are evident. The use of signal handling is standard and intended for controlled termination or interruption management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for managing SIGINT signals to prevent user interruption during critical sections. It does not contain malicious behavior or malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal.",
