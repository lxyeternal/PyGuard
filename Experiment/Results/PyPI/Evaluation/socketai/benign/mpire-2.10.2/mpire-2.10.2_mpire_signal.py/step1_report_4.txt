{
  "purpose": "The code manages signal handling for keyboard interrupts (SIGINT), allowing for delayed or ignored keyboard interrupts during execution, particularly in the main thread.",
  "sources": "The code reads the SIGINT signal handler using getsignal, and receives signals via the signal function in the signal module.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies signal handlers for SIGINT, potentially affecting how keyboard interrupts are handled or suppressed.",
  "flows": "The code sets custom signal handlers in __enter__ methods, potentially delaying or ignoring SIGINT, and restores original handlers in __exit__ methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code defines classes for delaying and disabling keyboard interrupts but contains no external input or data sources. It manipulates system signals, which could interfere with normal interrupt handling. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python signal handling to manage SIGINT signals, providing context managers to delay or ignore keyboard interrupts in the main thread. It safely restores original handlers after the context exits. The implementation appears straightforward and adheres to expected patterns for signal management. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The functions do not perform network operations, data leaks, or unauthorized system access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended for controlled handling of keyboard interrupts, primarily to prevent interruption during critical sections. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. The code is well-structured and does not pose security risks.",
