  "purpose": "Manage and suppress keyboard interrupt signals (SIGINT) in Python, especially within the main thread, by temporarily disabling or delaying handling of SIGINT signals.",
  "sources": "Reading signal handlers via getsignal(SIGINT), current_thread(), main_thread()",
  "sinks": "Setting signal handlers via signal_(SIGINT, ...), restoring handlers, ignoring SIGINT with SIG_IGN",
  "flows": "getsignal(SIGINT) -> signal_(SIGINT, ... or SIG_IGN) -> restoring previous handlers",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; functions perform expected signal handling tasks with thread checks to avoid unsafe operations in non-main threads",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions to manage SIGINT handling: DelayedKeyboardInterrupt delays handling of SIGINT signals, storing the received signal; DisableKeyboardInterruptSignal disables SIGINT handling within context blocks, restoring previous handlers afterwards. Both use thread checks to ensure safe operation only in main thread. The ignore_keyboard_interrupt() function sets SIGINT handler to ignore signals. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. Signal management is standard and intended for controlled interruption handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides controlled signal handling for SIGINT, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appropriately manages signal handlers in main thread contexts, with no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
