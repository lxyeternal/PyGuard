{
  "purpose": "Provides context managers to delay or ignore SIGINT signals in Python applications, primarily for controlled shutdown or critical sections.",
  "sources": "Reads from signal module (getsignal, signal, SIGINT, SIG_IGN), thread information (current_thread, main_thread), and signal handlers.",
  "sinks": "Sets signal handlers to SIG_IGN or custom handlers; restores previous handlers after context exit.",
  "flows": "On entering context, sets SIGINT handler; on exit, restores previous handler; signal received stored in class attribute.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code; straightforward signal handling with thread checks.",
  "analysis": "The code manages SIGINT signals using standard Python signal handling practices, with thread checks to prevent unsafe operations in non-main threads. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. Signal handlers are correctly restored after context exit. The functions are utility-based, intended for controlled signal management during program execution. No network activity, data leaks, or backdoors are detected. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with typical signal handling patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing SIGINT signals, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (0.1) is justified due to the potential impact of signal handling on process control but is acceptable given the controlled implementation. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero, indicating no malicious or obfuscated code.",
