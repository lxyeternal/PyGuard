{
  "purpose": "The code provides context managers to delay or disable handling of the SIGINT (keyboard interrupt) signal, primarily for use within a Python application's runtime environment.",
  "sources": "Reading current thread information (current_thread, main_thread), obtaining and setting signal handlers (getsignal, signal_), reading traceback information (Traceback).",
  "sinks": "Setting or ignoring signal handlers (signal_(SIGINT, ...)), restoring previous handlers, potentially delaying or suppressing keyboard interrupts.",
  "flows": "Input from thread checks and signal handling functions flow to setting or restoring signal handlers, with possible delays in keyboard interrupt handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no suspicious data leakage or malicious code. The code's structure is straightforward and matches typical signal handling practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two context managers for handling SIGINT signals: one delays the handling by capturing the signal during the context, and the other disables the keyboard interrupt entirely by ignoring SIGINT. The functions utilize standard Python signal handling modules and thread checks to ensure they operate only in the main thread. There are no obfuscated or malicious constructs. The code does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications beyond signal handling. It appears to serve legitimate purposes for controlling keyboard interrupts during critical sections.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of signal handling management for keyboard interrupts, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is useful for managing interrupt behavior in multi-threaded applications, and does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities.",
