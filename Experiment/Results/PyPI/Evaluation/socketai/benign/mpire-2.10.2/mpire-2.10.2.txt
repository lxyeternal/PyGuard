      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate multiprocessing worker framework with robust handling of signals, exceptions, and task execution. Its main security concern is the use of pickle/dill serialization, which could be exploited if untrusted data is processed. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-specific utility for progress bar management supporting multiple environments and multiprocessing. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The existing security scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation are appropriate. The risk score should be adjusted to 0, as the current 0.2 in report 4 is overly cautious given the benign nature of the code."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a multiprocessing worker pool with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The signaling mechanism is typical for process control. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified by the use of process signals but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation is absent. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured, with minimal security concerns."

The low security risk score (0.1) is justified due to the potential impact of signal handling on process control but is acceptable given the controlled implementation. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero, indicating no malicious or obfuscated code."
