  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as a progress bar handler with optional dashboard integration, reading parameters, progress state, and traceback info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data sinks; internal data flow is controlled.\n- **Anomalies:** The fallback functions for missing dashboard modules are standard; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. The code is a typical progress management utility with thread safety and optional dashboard reporting.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (low risk due to optional dashboard modules, but no real security concern).\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring aligns with the code's benign nature. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1, focusing on progress tracking and dashboard updates.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious external data sinks; safe internal data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of try-except for optional modules is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The code's focus is progress monitoring.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (very low).\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, with progress tracking and optional dashboard.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external malicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** Standard handling; no suspicious constructs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with previous reports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious data sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard progress handler.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as previous, managing progress with optional dashboard.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious external data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of optional imports with try-except is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (still low).\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0 in all cases, reflecting the optional dashboard modules and potential for misconfiguration, but overall very low.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are thorough, conservative, and accurate. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The risk scores, while slightly above zero, are justified given optional dependencies and the potential for misconfiguration, but do not indicate any real security threat.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are. The code appears safe, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.",
