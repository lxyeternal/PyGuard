{
  "purpose": "A multi-threaded progress bar handler with optional dashboard integration, managing progress updates, exception handling, and thread safety for monitoring task execution.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters, progress state variables, traceback strings, and shared dashboard dictionaries; interacts with worker communication objects.",
  "sinks": "Updates shared dashboard dictionaries, progress bar state, and signals for task completion or termination; stores traceback info internally.",
  "flows": "Progress updates flow from worker communication objects to progress bar and dashboard updates; exception info flows from error handlers to shared storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity; fallback functions for optional modules are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured progress monitoring utility employing threading, synchronization, and optional dashboard reporting. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious modifications. The use of conditional imports and thread-safe updates indicates careful design. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The traceback information is stored for reporting but not transmitted externally. Overall, the code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard progress handler with optional dashboard support. It employs secure threading and exception handling without any signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score reflects its benign nature.",
