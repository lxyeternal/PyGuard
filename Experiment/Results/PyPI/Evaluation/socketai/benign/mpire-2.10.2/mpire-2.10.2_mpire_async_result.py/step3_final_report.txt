{
  "purpose": "The code manages asynchronous task results, success/failure states, iteration over results, callbacks, and cache management using threading primitives.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from internal class attributes, cache, and callback functions.",
  "sinks": "Callback functions invoked upon task completion or failure; cache entries deleted after task completion.",
  "flows": "Source data (task results or exceptions) flow from internal processing to callback invocation or cache deletion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard threading-based async result handling with cache management, callbacks, and exception handling. No malicious patterns, external communication, or obfuscation are present. The import from 'mpire.comms' is part of a larger framework, not inherently suspicious. The code structure is typical for such utilities, with thread safety and callback mechanisms properly implemented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for managing asynchronous task results. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation are evident. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is zero.",
