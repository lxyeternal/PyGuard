  "flows": "No data flow observed within this snippet; only module imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'cpu_count' from the standard 'multiprocessing' module and 'WorkerPool' from the 'mpire.pool' package. These are common for parallel processing tasks in Python. No execution, input handling, or malicious behavior is evident. Since this is only import statements, there are no evident security concerns or malicious intent within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of standard module imports for multiprocessing and parallel processing. No malicious or suspicious activity is detectable in this snippet.",
