  "purpose": "Setup for cross-platform multiprocessing and threading contexts, with optional dill-based multiprocessing support.",
  "sources": "Platform.system() calls, import statements, context creation functions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data handling present",
  "flows": "Platform detection influences context setup; optional import affects context availability but not data flow",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and standard for environment configuration",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection, conditional imports, and context setup for multiprocessing and threading, with platform-specific adjustments. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The optional 'multiprocess' import is a common enhancement, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data handling are observed. The code is clear, well-structured, and typical for such setup routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign environment setup code for multiprocessing and threading, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is 0, reflecting the safe and standard implementation.",
