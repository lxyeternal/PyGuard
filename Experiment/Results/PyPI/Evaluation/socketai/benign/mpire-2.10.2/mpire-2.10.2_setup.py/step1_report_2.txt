  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'mpire' Python library, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst file, defining dependencies, and executing the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data or external commands executed.",
  "flows": "Read description from file -> setup configuration -> install dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It reads a README file and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No untrusted input is processed dynamically, no code execution, no network calls, or hidden behaviors. All dependencies are declared explicitly. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code appears typical for a Python package setup with no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal, benign setup configuration for packaging a Python project. No malicious intent or security risks detected.",
