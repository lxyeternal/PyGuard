  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'mpire' Python library, defining dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file, static package metadata, dependencies with environment markers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data output; no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script for Python packaging, with static metadata, dependencies, and no dynamic or malicious behavior. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or external data handling is present. All dependencies are standard, and the script performs no runtime actions beyond package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, standard, and free from malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are justified and consistent with the code content.",
