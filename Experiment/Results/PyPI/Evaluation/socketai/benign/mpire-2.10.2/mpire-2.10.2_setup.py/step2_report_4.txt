  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes that the setup script is legitimate, standard, and free of malicious behavior. The code only reads a README file and defines package metadata, dependencies, and scripts.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, justified as no security risks are identified.\n- **Validity:** The report's reasoning is sound; no suspicious patterns or malicious code are present.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it finds the script to be a typical setup script with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, risk is 0, aligning with the analysis.\n- **Validity:** The reasoning is consistent; no hidden behaviors detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the script appears standard, with no dynamic code, external data fetching, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; risk is 0.\n- **Validity:** The analysis is thorough and consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—standard setup script, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; risk is 0.\n- **Validity:** Well-founded reasoning.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Also finds no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; risk is 0.\n- **Validity:** Consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is standard, with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or suspicious patterns are identified across reports.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate given the code. Risk scores are 0, justified by the lack of any suspicious activity.\n- **Potential Assumptions:** No unwarranted assumptions are made; the analysis correctly identifies the script as benign.\n- **Code Verification:** The code provided is a typical `setup.py` script with no hidden or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (confirmed benign)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future updates or changes, but based on the current analysis, the package appears safe.",
