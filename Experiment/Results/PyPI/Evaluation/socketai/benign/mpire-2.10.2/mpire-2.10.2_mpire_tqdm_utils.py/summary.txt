  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-specific utility for progress bar management supporting multiple environments and multiprocessing. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The existing security scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation are appropriate. The risk score should be adjusted to 0, as the current 0.2 in report 4 is overly cautious given the benign nature of the code."
