{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for highlighting, removing highlighting, and populating exceptions with traceback info in a debugging context.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads untrusted input; it mainly processes strings and exception data.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external systems or performs dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow indicating malicious intent; functions process traceback strings and exception objects locally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes and functions for syntax highlighting and exception manipulation. It uses regex to strip ANSI escape sequences, highlights traceback strings with Pygments, and reconstructs exceptions with custom attributes. There are no input/output operations involving untrusted sources, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious behavior observed. The purpose appears solely for debugging or logging enhancements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for traceback visualization and exception handling in debugging contexts. No malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks identified.",
