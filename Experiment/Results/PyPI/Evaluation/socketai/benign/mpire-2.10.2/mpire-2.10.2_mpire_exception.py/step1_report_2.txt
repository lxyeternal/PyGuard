{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for highlighting and removing syntax highlighting from traceback strings, as well as populating exceptions with additional state information.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters: traceback strings, exception types, arguments, and state dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in this code; it processes and returns data but does not send data to external systems or perform I/O beyond formatting.",
  "flows": "Input traceback strings are processed for highlighting or removal; exception data and traceback are used to create exception objects with additional state.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of exception handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes and utility functions for syntax highlighting of tracebacks. The highlight_traceback function uses Pygments to add syntax coloring, which is a common practice for readability. The remove_highlighting function strips ANSI escape sequences, which is standard. The populate_exception function reconstructs exception objects with provided arguments and state, attaching a highlighted traceback string as an exception message. No external data sources, network operations, or file I/O are involved. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious, such as executing untrusted code, sending data over the network, or writing to files. The functions are focused solely on formatting and exception handling, with no signs of malicious intent or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely utility functions related to traceback highlighting and exception population, with no malicious behavior detected. It does not exhibit malware traits or security risks.",
