  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a multiprocessing worker pool with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The signaling mechanism is typical for process control. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified by the use of process signals but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation is absent. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured, with minimal security concerns."
