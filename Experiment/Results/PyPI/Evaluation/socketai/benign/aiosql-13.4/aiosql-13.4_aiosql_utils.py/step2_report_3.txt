  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code defines regex patterns for identifying colon-style variable references in SQL code, with comments indicating awareness of platform-specific nuances and incomplete sections (FIXME, NOTE).\n- It sets up logging and custom exceptions for SQL loading and parsing errors.\n- No functions process untrusted data, no code injection, no network activity, and no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The regex patterns include quotes handling to avoid false positives, which is good practice.\n- The comments suggest the code is a work-in-progress or a utility module, not a malicious component.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The code is straightforward, with some comments indicating incomplete implementation (FIXME, NOTE). No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n  - **Risk score:** All reports assign very low (around 0.1–0.2), which seems reasonable given the code's benign nature.  \n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the clear code.\n\n- **Justification for high scores (>0.5):**  \n  None of the reports suggest any reason to assign higher scores. The code does not perform dangerous operations.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent; all assessments are cautious and accurate.\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's nature—benign regex pattern definitions, simple exception classes, and logging setup.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The overall security assessment should remain at **malware: 0**, **risk: 0.1–0.2**, **obfuscated: 0**.\n- The code appears to be a utility component for SQL parsing, with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware         | 0                 | No malicious activity or payloads present.                  |\n| obfuscated      | 0                 | Clear, straightforward regex and class definitions.        |\n| securityRisk    | 0.1               | Minimal risk; potential misconfiguration could lead to issues if misused, but no actual vulnerabilities are evident. |\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, with no malware or security risks. The reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
