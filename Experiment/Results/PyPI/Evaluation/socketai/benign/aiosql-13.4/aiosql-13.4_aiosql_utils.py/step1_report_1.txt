  "purpose": "Define regular expressions for identifying colon-variable patterns in SQL code and set up logging and custom exceptions for SQL loading and parsing errors.",
  "sources": "re.compile() patterns for matching quoted strings and colon-variables in SQL code",
  "sinks": "None of the functions or code segments perform actions that process untrusted data directly; no apparent sinks for data leaks or dangerous operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; the code primarily sets up regex patterns and exception classes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. Comments indicate incomplete or to-be-improved code, but no suspicious activities are present",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for parsing SQL statements, specifically targeting variable references with colons, including quoted strings to avoid matching inside quotes. Logging setup is present but not configured to log at any level. Custom exceptions for SQL loading and parsing errors are straightforward. There are no functions that execute untrusted input, no code injection points, and no suspicious behavior beyond preliminary pattern definitions. The comments suggest awareness of potential issues or platform-specific behavior, but no malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic setup for regex-based SQL parsing with logging and custom exceptions. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or significant security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, benign project intended for SQL processing.",
