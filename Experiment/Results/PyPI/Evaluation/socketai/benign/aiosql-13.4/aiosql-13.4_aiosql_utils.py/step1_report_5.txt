  "purpose": "Define regular expressions for identifying colon-variable patterns in SQL code, with associated exception classes and logging setup.",
  "sources": "Re compilation of regex patterns, module imports, logging setup, class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not perform data output, network communication, or data modification.",
  "flows": "Input data would be SQL code processed through regex matching; no direct flows to sensitive operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "Commented 'FIXME' and 'NOTE' suggest awareness of platform-specific issues; no malicious or suspicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up regex patterns to identify variable references in SQL code, including handling quoted strings and specific variable naming conventions. It includes exception classes for SQL loading and parsing errors, and initializes a logger. No user input processing, data leaks, network operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a utility module for SQL parsing with no malicious intent or malware indications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for regex-based SQL parsing with exception handling and logging. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected based on this code fragment.",
