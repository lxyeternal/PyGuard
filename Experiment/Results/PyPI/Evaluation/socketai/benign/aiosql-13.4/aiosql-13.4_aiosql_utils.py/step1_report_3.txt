{
  "purpose": "Defines regular expressions to identify colon-style variable references in SQL code and sets up logging and custom exception classes for SQL loading and parsing errors.",
  "sources": "Imports 're' and 'logging'; no external input sources present in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly compiles regex patterns and defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. Comments indicate ongoing development or improvements needed, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code compiles regex patterns for detecting SQL variable references, which could be used later for parsing or sanitization. It sets up a logger for the package and defines exception classes for handling SQL load and parse errors. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard setup for pattern matching and exception handling related to SQL processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
