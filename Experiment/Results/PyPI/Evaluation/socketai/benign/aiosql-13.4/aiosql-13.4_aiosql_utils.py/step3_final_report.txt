  "purpose": "Define regex patterns for identifying colon-variable references in SQL code, with platform-specific considerations, and set up logging and custom exceptions for SQL content handling.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns for variable references, comments indicating platform-specific considerations, and exception class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or data leaks; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Regex patterns are used for parsing SQL code; no data flow leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "Comments indicating incomplete implementation (FIXME, NOTE); no malicious or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for parsing SQL variable references, with comments about platform-specific issues. It sets up logging and custom exceptions but does not process untrusted data or execute dangerous operations. The regex patterns include quotes handling to avoid false positives. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The comments suggest ongoing development but do not imply malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with benign pattern definitions and exception classes. The code is straightforward and does not pose security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for regex-based SQL parsing, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
