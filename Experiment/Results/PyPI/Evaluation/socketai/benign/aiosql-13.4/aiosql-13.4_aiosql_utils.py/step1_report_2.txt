{
  "purpose": "Define regex patterns for identifying colon-variables in SQL code and set up logging and custom exceptions for SQL loading and parsing errors.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns compile regex from string literals; logging setup; exception class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines patterns and exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes regex patterns for parsing SQL variable references and sets up logging and custom exceptions. The regex patterns appear to be used for identifying variable placeholders within SQL statements, with comments indicating considerations for specific SQL dialects (PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB). The logging configuration is standard, and the exception classes are simple custom exceptions without additional logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code does not process untrusted data directly and does not contain any network or file I/O operations that could be exploited. The regex patterns and class definitions are typical and do not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign module for regex pattern compilation and exception handling related to SQL parsing. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
