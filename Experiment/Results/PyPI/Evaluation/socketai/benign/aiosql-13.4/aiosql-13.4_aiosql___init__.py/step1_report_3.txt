  "purpose": "This code defines module exports and retrieves the package version for the aiosql library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules (.aiosql, .utils) and metadata version retrieval from importlib.metadata.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; simple import and version retrieval operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. Use of __version__ is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from local modules and a version number from package metadata, then exposes selected functions and exceptions. All actions are straightforward module setup steps without any dynamic code execution, external network activity, or data leaks. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or risky operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign module initialization script with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
