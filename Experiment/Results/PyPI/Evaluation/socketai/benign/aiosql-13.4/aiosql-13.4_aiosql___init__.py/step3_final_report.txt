{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a package initialization module, importing functions and exceptions from internal modules, retrieving the package version, and defining the public API.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from internal modules (.aiosql, .utils) and uses importlib.metadata.version to get package version.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and version retrieval without dynamic or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with standard import statements and version retrieval. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal package setup script performing static imports and version retrieval. No dynamic data, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The use of importlib.metadata.version is standard practice. No signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or obfuscation are observed. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices confirm its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
