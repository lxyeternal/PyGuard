{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package's __init__.py file, responsible for importing functions and exceptions from internal modules and exposing them publicly. It also retrieves the package version.",
  "sources": "import statements: '.aiosql', '.utils', and 'importlib.metadata.version'",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not process untrusted data or user input directly",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from source to sink",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code simply performs imports and version retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and exceptions from local modules and exposes them via __all__. It also dynamically retrieves the package version using 'importlib.metadata.version'. This is standard practice for Python package __init__.py files to define public API. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward package initialization file, exposing public functions and exceptions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
