{
  "purpose": "This code sets up imports and exports for a Python package/module related to SQL parsing and handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements: from .aiosql, from .utils, and from importlib.metadata; version retrieval for 'aiosql'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or exposed.",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules and the retrieval of package version information, with no data flow from external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code primarily consists of import statements and a version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and exceptions from local modules, retrieves the package version using standard library, and defines __all__ for export. There are no signs of data manipulation, input handling, or suspicious code patterns. The use of importlib.metadata.version is standard for retrieving package version info. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as a module initialization file that manages imports and version info without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
