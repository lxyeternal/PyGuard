{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module imports and metadata for a package related to asynchronous SQL operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules (.aiosql, .utils) and the importlib.metadata.version function to retrieve package version.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the only dynamic operation is retrieving the package version.",
  "flows": "The version retrieval flows from the importlib.metadata API to the __version__ variable; no other data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from local modules and metadata functions for versioning. It assigns the package version to __version__ and exports specific symbols. There are no dynamic code execution, input handling, or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages imports and metadata.",
