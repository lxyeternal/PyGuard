  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of import statements from local modules (.aiosql, .utils) and a call to `importlib.metadata.version` to retrieve the package version.\n- It assigns the version to `__version__` and defines `__all__` to control exports.\n- There are no data flows from untrusted sources, no input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity.\n- The code is minimal, standard for Python package initialization (`__init__.py`), and does not contain obfuscation or malicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1-4:\n- All four reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n- They correctly identify that the code performs straightforward imports, version retrieval, and exports.\n- Their confidence is high (1), and they assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Logical issues:**\n- No issues are present in their reasoning.\n- Their scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- Contains a JSON parse error, but the embedded analysis is consistent with the previous reports.\n- The detailed reasoning aligns with the understanding that this code is a standard package setup.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Security risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Are there any signs of malicious intent?** No.\n- **Is there any suspicious data flow?** No.\n- **Are there any anomalies or obfuscation?** No.\n- **Is the use of `importlib.metadata.version` risky?** No, it's standard for package version retrieval.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is typical for Python package initialization.\n- The high confidence scores across reports are justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence provided.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
