  "purpose": "Retrieve user information and greetings from an SQLite database using asynchronous SQL queries.",
  "sources": "Reading data from 'greetings.sql' file via 'aiosql' and fetching data from 'greetings.db' SQLite database.",
  "sinks": "Printing greetings to the console, which is benign in this context.",
  "flows": "The code reads data from the database and outputs greetings; no untrusted data flows to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution; no obfuscated code; usage of standard libraries and well-defined queries.",
  "analysis": "The code uses 'aiosql' to load SQL queries from an external file, then connects to a SQLite database to fetch user data and greetings. The data is fetched via predefined queries, which likely use parameterized statements (assuming correct implementation). There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The usage appears straightforward and benign. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard database read operation for greeting purposes, with no malicious or suspicious activity observed. It does not include any malicious behaviors or security risks.",
