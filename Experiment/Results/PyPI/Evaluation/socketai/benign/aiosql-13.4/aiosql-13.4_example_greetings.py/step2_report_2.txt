  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code performs straightforward database read operations.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- The code uses 'aiosql' to load external SQL queries, which is standard practice.\n- The database interactions seem to use parameterized queries, reducing injection risk.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The only data sink is printing to the console, which is benign.\n- The 'username' parameter appears static or controlled, with no indication of user input from untrusted sources.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears correct; no errors or anomalies are detected.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; all reports assign malware score 0.\n- **Security risks:** Very low; only minor concerns about SQL parameterization, which seems handled properly.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Data flow:** No dangerous data flows or untrusted data reaching sensitive sinks.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** The reports assume proper parameterization, which seems reasonable given the use of 'aiosql'. No evidence suggests otherwise.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware: consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, consistent.\n  - Security risk: ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Note on risk scores:** Since the code is purely read-only, with no external communication or data manipulation, a risk score above 0.2 would be unjustified unless specific untrusted input is involved. The only input parameter ('username') is hardcoded, reducing risk further.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, standard database read operations)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since no external data flows or secrets are involved)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are consistent and reasonable. The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware at 0.\n- Keep obfuscated at 0.\n- Maintain a very low security risk score (~0.1–0.2).\n\nThis code appears safe and well within acceptable security parameters.",
