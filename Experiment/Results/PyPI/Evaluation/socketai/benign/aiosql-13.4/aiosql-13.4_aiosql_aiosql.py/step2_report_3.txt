  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code primarily manages database adapter registration, selection, and SQL query loading from strings or files.\n- It does not execute SQL queries directly; actual execution occurs elsewhere.\n- It allows dynamic registration and overriding of adapters, which could be misused if untrusted input is passed as driver names.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The functions handle user input (file paths, driver names, SQL strings) with appropriate error handling.\n- The code appears standard for a query management library, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as a query loader and adapter manager.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** User inputs can be untrusted but no direct execution or network activity.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent, standard structure.\n- **Risk Score:** `0.2` — Low, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Malware Score:** `0` — No malware activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on utility functions.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; dynamic adapter registration is flexible but not malicious.\n- **Risk Score:** `0.2` — Appropriate.\n- **Malware Score:** `0` — No malware activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same general description.\n- **Analysis:** No unsafe operations; no execution of untrusted data.\n- **Risk Score:** `0` or `0.2` — The report assigns `0`, which is reasonable given no security risk is evident.\n- **Malware Score:** `0` — No malware.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; functions are for loading and managing queries.\n- **Risk Score:** `0.2` — Slightly conservative but acceptable.\n- **Malware Score:** `0` — No malware.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Similar utility functions.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; dynamic registration is typical.\n- **Risk Score:** `0.2` — Reasonable.\n- **Malware Score:** `0` — No malware.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment**\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Risk Scores:** The conservative `0.2` reflects awareness that dynamic registration could be misused if user input is untrusted, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate**\n\n**Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, well-structured code.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.2** — Slightly cautious due to dynamic registration and untrusted input potential, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, flexible utility for loading SQL queries and managing database adapters, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low risk score is appropriate, considering potential misuse in untrusted contexts but no inherent malicious intent.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current risk assessment but emphasize the importance of validating user inputs (driver names, SQL content) in production environments to prevent misuse.",
