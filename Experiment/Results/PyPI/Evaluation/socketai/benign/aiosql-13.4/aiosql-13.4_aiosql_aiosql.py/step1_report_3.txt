{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for loading and managing SQL queries from strings or files, supporting multiple database adapters and customizations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters such as sql strings, file paths, adapter names, and optional keyword arguments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not execute SQL or handle untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through adapter creation and query loading functions, but there are no unsafe operations, SQL execution, or untrusted data handling within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code primarily manages adapter registration and query loading logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines adapter mappings, and provides functions for registering adapters and loading SQL queries from strings or files. It creates adapter instances based on string identifiers or callables, with error handling for unregistered drivers. It loads SQL data into query objects without executing or processing untrusted data, and does not perform network operations or system modifications. The code does not contain any hidden or malicious logic; its structure and operations are typical for a query management system.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation for managing SQL queries and database adapters. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present. It does not perform any unsafe operations, and no evidence of sabotage or malware is detected.",
