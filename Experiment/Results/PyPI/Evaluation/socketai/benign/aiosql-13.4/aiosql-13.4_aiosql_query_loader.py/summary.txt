  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SQL loader/parser with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security consideration is ensuring that external SQL execution via 'process_sql' is performed on sanitized inputs. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use in secure environments."
