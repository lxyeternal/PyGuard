  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described logic and potential risks, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code loads queries from strings, files, directories, extracting metadata.\n- **Sinks:** Uses `driver_adapter.process_sql`—standard, but a potential risk if inputs are untrusted.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, regex-based parsing, attribute substitution—standard practices.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The main concern is external `process_sql`, which could be risky if untrusted inputs are passed.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears benign, with security risk mainly dependent on external SQL handling.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low). This seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, focusing on file and string parsing.\n- **Sinks:** Same as above, with `process_sql`.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Regex parsing, attribute substitution, logging warnings for non-ASCII names—nothing malicious.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code is standard SQL loader with some dynamic signature creation.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but overall low risk.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard SQL query loader.\n- **Sinks:** Same as above, with potential for injection if inputs are malicious.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Regex parsing, attribute substitution, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis:** No malware, obfuscation, or malicious code. The dynamic signature creation and attribute substitution could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n- **Conclusion:** Low security risk, primarily if external inputs are untrusted.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar parsing and processing.\n- **Sinks:** `process_sql` again, with potential if SQL is malicious.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Regex parsing, attribute substitution, no obfuscation or secrets.\n- **Analysis:** No malware, backdoors, or obfuscation. The main concern is handling untrusted SQL, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Overall low risk, with caution needed if inputs are untrusted.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3 (slightly higher but still low).\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard SQL loader.\n- **Sinks:** Similar, with `process_sql`.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Regex parsing, no malicious code, no secrets.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility code.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly identify no malware signatures, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; regex-based parsing is standard but not malicious.\n- **Risk Scores:** The primary concern is the potential for SQL injection or misuse if inputs are untrusted, especially given the dynamic nature of SQL processing and attribute substitution.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent across reports and no evidence of malicious payloads)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3 (low, but warrants caution if inputs are untrusted)\n\n**Final justification:** The code is a typical SQL loader/parser with no malicious intent. The external `process_sql` function is a potential sink, but without evidence of malicious payloads or obfuscation, the risk remains low. The regex parsing and attribute substitution are standard techniques, not indicators of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 | No signs of malicious code or payloads                      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 | Clear, straightforward regex and parsing logic             |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2–0.3           | Potential if inputs are untrusted; standard parsing risks   |\n\n**Recommendation:** Ensure that external inputs to `load_query_data_from_sql` and `process_sql` are sanitized and validated to mitigate injection risks. The code itself is benign and standard for SQL query management.",
