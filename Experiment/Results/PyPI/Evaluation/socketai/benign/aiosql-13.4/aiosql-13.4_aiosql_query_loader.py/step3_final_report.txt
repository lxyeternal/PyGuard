  "purpose": "Load and parse SQL queries from strings, files, or directories, extracting metadata, comments, and attributes to build QueryDatum objects for further processing.",
  "sources": "File contents, SQL query strings, and comment lines within SQL code.",
  "sinks": "The external method 'driver_adapter.process_sql', which executes or manipulates SQL statements.",
  "flows": "Source data (SQL code) is processed by regex-based comment removal and attribute substitution, then passed to 'process_sql' for execution or transformation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex for parsing SQL comments and metadata; dynamic signature creation; attribute substitution based on object attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard SQL query loading with comment stripping, metadata extraction, and attribute substitution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. The primary security concern is the external 'process_sql' method, which could execute malicious SQL if given untrusted input. The regex-based parsing is brittle but not malicious. The code structure is straightforward, with no hidden or malicious behaviors. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting external dependencies and potential misuse if inputs are malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SQL loader/parser with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security consideration is ensuring that external SQL execution via 'process_sql' is performed on sanitized inputs. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use in secure environments.",
