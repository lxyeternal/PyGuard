  "purpose": "Asynchronous retrieval of greetings and user information from a local SQLite database using external SQL queries.",
  "sources": "Reading SQL queries from 'greetings.sql' and fixed username input 'willvaughn'.",
  "sinks": "Printing greetings and user info to the console; no external data transmission or untrusted input processing.",
  "flows": "SQL queries loaded from file -> database connection -> execution of 'get_all_greetings' and 'get_user_by_username' -> output to console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; straightforward async database access.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard async database queries with external SQL files and fixed input. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The data flow is simple, with no external network activity or data leaks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. External SQL file content is unknown but appears typical. The fixed username does not introduce risk. Overall, the code is a normal, secure pattern for database access with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the assigned scores are justified and accurate.",
