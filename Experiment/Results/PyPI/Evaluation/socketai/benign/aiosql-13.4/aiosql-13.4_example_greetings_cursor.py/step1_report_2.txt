{
  "purpose": "The code connects to a SQLite database and retrieves greeting data using a SQL query loaded from an external file.",
  "sources": "Reads the SQL query from 'greetings.sql' via aiosql; connects to 'greetings.db' using aiosqlite; fetches data from the database.",
  "sinks": "Print statements output data; data is fetched from the database, but no untrusted input is directly executed or output in a vulnerable way.",
  "flows": "The SQL query from the external file is executed on the database connection; the results are fetched and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. The SQL file's contents are external, but no indication of malicious SQL or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports asyncio for asynchronous execution, aiosql and aiosqlite for database interactions, and uses a query loaded from an external file. It connects securely to a local database, executes a predefined query, and prints the results. No user input is directly incorporated into the SQL command, reducing risk of injection. The code structure appears standard, with proper resource management. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. External SQL query usage is typical for modular applications, and no malicious payloads or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code securely reads and executes a predefined SQL query from an external file and outputs the results without any evident malicious intent. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code.",
