{
  "purpose": "To access and print greeting data from an SQLite database using aiosqlite and a pre-defined SQL query.",
  "sources": "Reading the SQL query from 'greetings.sql' via aiosql and connecting to 'greetings.db' database.",
  "sinks": "Printing data to stdout (console). No data is written to external systems or transmitted over the network.",
  "flows": "The code reads SQL commands from an external file, executes a query on the database, retrieves data, and prints it.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. Usage of external SQL file could be a supply chain concern if the file is malicious, but the code itself appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an asynchronous SQL query object from an external file, then connects to an SQLite database. It executes a predefined query to fetch all greetings, then prints column info and the fetched data. No user input handling, environment variable use, or network communication present. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are identified. The query source 'greetings.sql' could be a supply chain vector if malicious, but within this code, the handling is straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard database access and data printing operations with no evident malicious intent. The primary concern is the external SQL file's integrity, but the code itself is benign and typical for database operations.",
