{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and logging capabilities for the qianfan.utils package, primarily for managing logging and environment/configuration variables.",
  "sources": "Imports functions and classes from qianfan.utils.logging and qianfan.utils.utils modules, which are external dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present in this snippet; the functions imported may handle input, but their implementation is not shown here.",
  "flows": "The code imports and re-exports functions and classes, establishing interfaces for logging and environment/config management but does not contain runtime data flow logic itself.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. The code is mainly import statements and an __all__ list for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a module that consolidates and exposes logging functions and utility functions from external modules. There is no data processing, no input handling, and no output or network operations. The imports suggest dependency on other parts of the project, but none of those are visible here. The structure is standard for a utility module, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module that imports and re-exports functions and classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious data flows, or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
