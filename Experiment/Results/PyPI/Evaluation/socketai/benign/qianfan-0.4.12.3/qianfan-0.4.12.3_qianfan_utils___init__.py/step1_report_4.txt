{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and logging configuration for the 'qianfan' package, mainly importing and exposing functions and classes related to logging and environment variable handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'qianfan.utils.logging' and 'qianfan.utils.utils' modules, which likely involve internal utility functions and classes.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data or potentially dangerous actions. The code does not perform data processing or system calls.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and re-exports functions and classes without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code strictly consists of imports and __all__ declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a module that imports logging functions and utility functions from the 'qianfan' package's utils submodule, then exposes them via __all__. There are no functions, data processing, or system interactions that could introduce security issues or malicious behavior. The functions imported are typical for logging and environment variable handling, and there is no evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The licensing and copyright comments are standard and do not indicate any malicious purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module focused on importing and re-exporting functions for logging and environment management. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks within this fragment.",
