{
  "purpose": "This module serves as a utility aggregator for logging and environment/configuration handling functions, providing a set of imported functions and classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports functions and classes from 'qianfan.utils.logging' and 'qianfan.utils.utils' modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data directly, as this code only imports and exposes functions.",
  "flows": "The module does not perform any data flow or processing; it merely re-exports imported functions and classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific utility functions and logging mechanisms from internal modules, then exposes these via __all__ for external use. It is a standard pattern for utility modules. No data processing, input/output, or network operations are performed. The code structure is clean, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. The imported functions, based on their names, suggest standard logging and environment variable handling, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility aggregator module without any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply re-exports selected functions for use elsewhere, with no suspicious operations detected.",
