  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SDK setup script with environment-based configuration, optional stress testing, and custom module management. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The only point of caution is the '_ModuleFinder' import, which should be reviewed further, but based on this snippet, it appears benign."
