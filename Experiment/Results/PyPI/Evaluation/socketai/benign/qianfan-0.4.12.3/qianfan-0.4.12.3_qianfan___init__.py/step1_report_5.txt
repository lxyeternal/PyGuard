  "purpose": "A library designed to help developers interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) and provide utility functions for configuration, resource management, and performance testing.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'QIANFAN_ENABLE_STRESS_TEST'; imports from local modules and package resources.",
  "sinks": "Potential injection points via environment variables; dynamic module loading via sys.meta_path; configuration functions that may handle secrets.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'QIANFAN_ENABLE_STRESS_TEST' influences whether gevent monkey patching occurs; imported configuration variables (AK, SK, etc.) and functions are used for setup; the imported modules are made accessible via the module's namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable for enabling stress testing; dynamic insertion into sys.meta_path; no hardcoded secrets present in the code snippet; the import of potentially sensitive configuration values suggests handling secrets, but does not directly expose them.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a library for LLM interaction with optional performance testing enabled via an environment variable. It performs dynamic patching with gevent if specified, and inserts a custom module finder into sys.meta_path for module loading manipulation. It imports various configuration, resource, utility, and version modules, and exposes selected components via __all__. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. Sensitive data such as AK and SK are imported from configuration modules, implying they are handled securely outside this file. The code structure is typical for a library setup and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign library initialization script with optional stress testing. No malicious behavior or malware indications are present. It manages configurations and resource imports securely and transparently, with no signs of security risks or hidden backdoors.",
