  "purpose": "Utility for managing Baidu BOS storage operations such as uploading, downloading, URL generation, and metadata handling.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration via get_config(), user inputs for file paths, and SDK functions fetching object metadata.",
  "sinks": "Calls to SDK functions that perform network operations (upload, download, generate URLs, delete objects).",
  "flows": "Source (get_config() or input paths) to SDK functions performing network or storage operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Exception handling is broad but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around Baidu BOS SDK, fetching credentials from external configuration, validating paths with regex, and performing standard storage operations. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Exception handling is broad but intended for robustness. The code does not perform any suspicious network activity or data exfiltration. The use of get_config() for credentials is typical but should be securely managed externally. Overall, the code appears benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for Baidu BOS interactions with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or sabotage. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
