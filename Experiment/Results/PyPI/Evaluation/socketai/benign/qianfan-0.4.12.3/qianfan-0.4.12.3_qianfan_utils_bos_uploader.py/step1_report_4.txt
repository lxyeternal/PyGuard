  "purpose": "Utility class for managing and uploading files to Baidu Object Storage (BOS), including generating URLs, checking existence, and metadata handling.",
  "sources": "Configuration fetching via get_config(), environment variables, and input parameters for methods such as upload_content_to_bos, upload_file_to_bos, and parse_bos_path.",
  "sinks": "Methods interacting with the BosClient such as put_object_from_string, put_object_from_file, generate_pre_signed_url, get_object_meta_data, delete_object, and get_object_to_file.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., data, file paths, bucket names) flow into BOS client methods that perform uploads, URL generation, metadata retrieval, and file management. These actions depend on inputs that could be influenced by external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code detected; standard usage of BOS SDK for storage operations. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code present. Exception handling is generic, with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides a wrapper around Baidu BOS SDK for file storage operations. Credentials are fetched via configuration functions, not hardcoded. Path validation uses regex to ensure proper formatting, and functions handle common storage tasks like upload, download, and metadata retrieval. The methods do not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior; all actions appear consistent with legitimate storage management. No indicators of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for interacting with Baidu BOS, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain attacks. It safely handles storage operations and validation, with proper exception handling. The overall security risk is minimal.",
