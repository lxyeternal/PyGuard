  "purpose": "Utility class and functions for managing files in Baidu BOS cloud storage, including upload, download, URL generation, and path validation.",
  "sources": "Configuration retrieval via get_config(), method parameters, and class constructor inputs (region, ak, sk).",
  "sinks": "BosClient methods such as put_object_from_string, put_object_from_file, generate_pre_signed_url, get_object_meta_data, get_object_to_file, delete_object, copy_object.",
  "flows": "Inputs from configuration or method arguments flow into BosClient methods which perform actions on cloud storage, such as uploading files, generating URLs, checking existence, and retrieving metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present in the code. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious variable names. Path validation uses regex, which is standard. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around Baidu's BOS SDK, providing functions for file operations and path handling. Credentials are obtained from configuration, not hardcoded. The functions perform expected cloud storage interactions such as uploads, downloads, URL generation, existence checks, and listing directories. Exception handling is simple and intended for robustness. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for cloud storage interaction with no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. It follows standard practices for cloud SDK usage and path validation. No security risks or malware signals are identified.",
