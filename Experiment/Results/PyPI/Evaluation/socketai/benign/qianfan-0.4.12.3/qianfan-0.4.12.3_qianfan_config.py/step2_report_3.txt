  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages SDK configuration, reads environment variables, and handles credentials. The `auth_key()` method hashes multiple credential fields with MD5, potentially for identification or authentication purposes. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. SSL verification is disabled by default, which is a security concern but not malicious.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to SSL verification being disabled by default.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard configuration management with no malicious intent. The only concern is the default SSL verification setting, which is documented as a warning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on credential management and hashing credentials in `auth_key()`. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code. The use of MD5 for hashing is noted but appears to be for generating an identifier, not security-critical.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** Standard configuration code, no malicious behavior. Use of deprecated setter functions is noted but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; manages environment variables, credentials, and hashing. No malicious code or obfuscation. The MD5 hash in `auth_key()` is used for credential combination, not security purposes.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity detected. The code is a typical SDK configuration module.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on credential management, environment variables, and deprecated setters. The `auth_key()` hashes combined credentials with MD5. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity. The use of deprecated functions is noted but not malicious.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** Safe configuration code, with some caution about deprecated functions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; manages SDK configuration, credentials, and hashes credentials with MD5. No malicious code or obfuscation. The `auth_key()` function's behavior is consistent with previous reports.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is purely configuration management with no network, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated (0.2) due to default SSL verification being disabled, which is a documented warning but not malicious.\n\n- **Potential concerns:** The use of MD5 hashing of sensitive credentials in `auth_key()` could be a privacy concern if exposed, but it appears to be used for generating an identifier, not security. The deprecated setter functions could be misused but are marked deprecated.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Overall malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated:** **0** — code is transparent.\n\n**Security risk score:** **0.2** — mainly due to default SSL verification setting.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0.\n\n**Malware score:** 0.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, transparent configuration management module for an SDK, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The main caution is the default SSL verification setting, which should be configured appropriately in production environments.",
