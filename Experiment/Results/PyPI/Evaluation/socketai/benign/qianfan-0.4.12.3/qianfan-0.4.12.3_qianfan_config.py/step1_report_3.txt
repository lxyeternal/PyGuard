{
  "purpose": "Define configuration management for the qianfan SDK, including environment variables, credential handling, and deprecated setters for credentials.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (get_config() with _env_file), method parameters for credentials (AK, SK, access_token, etc.), environment variables (via os.getenv).",
  "sinks": "Hashing in auth_key() function, assignment to configuration attributes (AK, SK, etc.), environment variable access, config parsing and updating.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (AK, SK, tokens) flow into config attributes via deprecated setter functions; environment variables are read during config initialization; auth_key() creates a hash from credentials; config attributes are accessed and potentially used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The auth_key() method creates a hash from multiple credential fields, which might be used as a secret or identifier. No hardcoded credentials are present. No suspicious or obfuscated code detected. Use of deprecated functions for setting sensitive data; however, this is explicitly marked deprecated, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages SDK configuration including environment variable reading, credential setting, and secure hashing for auth purposes. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. Functions and code structure are straightforward and intended for configuration management. Use of hashing in auth_key() could be for generating a cache or token, which is normal. No suspicious network activity, no encrypted payloads, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration setup module for SDK credentials and environment variables with no indications of malicious intent. It manages sensitive data via environment and attribute assignments, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
