  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- It manages SDK configuration, including environment variables, default values, and credential attributes.\n- Credentials (AK, SK, access tokens, etc.) are stored as class attributes, with some functions to set them (notably deprecated).\n- The `auth_key()` method concatenates multiple credential fields and hashes them with MD5, returning a 24-character substring.\n- The code reads environment variables, allows setting attributes via deprecated functions, and manages sensitive data in memory.\n- It does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or network activity.\n- Default SSL verification is enabled, with a warning about disabling SSL verification.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed findings:\n\n- No hardcoded secrets or malicious code.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious network activity.\n- Credential handling is straightforward.\n- Use of deprecated setter functions for credentials is documented, not malicious.\n- The `auth_key()` method creates an MD5 hash from multiple credential fields, which could be used as an identifier or cache key, but not as a cryptographically secure token.\n- Default SSL verification is enabled, with a warning about disabling it.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n**Malware / Malicious behavior:**\n\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- No network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n- The hashing of credentials is typical for generating identifiers or cache keys, not malicious.\n\n**Obfuscation:**\n\n- The code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n\n**Security risks:**\n\n- The main potential risk is the handling of sensitive credentials, especially since they can be set via deprecated functions, which might be misused if exposed.\n- The `auth_key()` method's MD5 hash is not secure for cryptographic purposes but seems intended as an identifier, not a security token.\n- The default SSL verification being enabled is good; the warning about disabling SSL is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Score assessments:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.2          | No malicious activity, just configuration management. The only concern is default SSL verification and credential handling, which are not malicious. |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.2          | Same as above; standard config management, no malware. |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.2          | No malicious behavior; credential handling is typical. |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.2          | No malicious activity; deprecated functions pose a risk if misused but are not malicious. |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.2          | Same as above; no malicious behavior. |\n\n**Note:** The overall security risk is low; the main concern is the handling of credentials and the deprecated functions, which could be misused but are not malicious in themselves.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (low, mainly due to credential handling and SSL verification warning)\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n\n- The use of MD5 in `auth_key()` is not secure for cryptographic purposes but seems intended for generating a cache or identifier, not for security.\n- Deprecated setter functions could be misused if exposed, but their deprecation indicates they are not recommended.\n- No evidence of supply chain attack or malicious payload.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, well-structured configuration management module for an SDK, with no malicious intent or malware. The security risks are minimal and relate mainly to best practices around credential management and SSL verification.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more conservative or aggressive scoring approach, but based on the evidence, these scores are appropriate.",
