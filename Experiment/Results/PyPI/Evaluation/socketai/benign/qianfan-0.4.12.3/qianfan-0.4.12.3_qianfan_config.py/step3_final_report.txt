  "anomalies": "Use of MD5 hashing for credentials, deprecated functions for setting sensitive data",
  "analysis": "The code manages SDK configuration, reading environment variables and storing credentials. The auth_key() method concatenates multiple credential fields and hashes them with MD5, likely for identification or cache purposes, not security. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. Deprecated functions for setting credentials could be misused but are marked deprecated. The default SSL verification setting is documented as a warning, posing a potential security concern if misconfigured. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior detected. The use of MD5 is insecure for cryptographic purposes but appears intended for non-security identification. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent SDK configuration module with no malicious intent. The main concerns are the use of MD5 hashing for credentials and the default SSL verification setting, which should be configured properly in production. The deprecated setter functions pose a risk if misused but are marked deprecated, indicating intended obsolescence. Overall, the code is safe, with low security risk and no malware detected.",
