{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration management for the qianfan SDK, including environment variable handling, deprecation utilities, and credential setting functions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (via os.getenv), user-supplied parameters in functions, and default values set during class initialization.",
  "sinks": "Credential attributes (AK, SK, ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_KEY, SECRET_KEY) stored in memory; the auth_key method hashes credentials; get_config functions access configuration data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → Config class attributes; deprecated functions → config attributes; auth_key method combines credentials into a string and hashes it.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated functions for credential setting; no hardcoded secrets present, only optional attributes; potential for credential leaks if config is exposed, but no evidence of malicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles configuration settings for the SDK, with functions to set credentials and retrieve configuration data. It uses environment variables, default values, and deprecated setter functions. The auth_key method combines several credential attributes and hashes them with MD5, returning a string of 24 characters, which could be used for session identification but does not pose security risks by itself. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The deprecation warnings indicate an intended transition away from setter functions but do not introduce malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration management module for an SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It manages credentials and configuration options securely and transparently. No anomalous or malicious activities are detected.",
