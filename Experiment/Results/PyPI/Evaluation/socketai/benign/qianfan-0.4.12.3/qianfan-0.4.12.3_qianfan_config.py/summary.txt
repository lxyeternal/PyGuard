  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent SDK configuration module with no malicious intent. The main concerns are the use of MD5 hashing for credentials and the default SSL verification setting, which should be configured properly in production. The deprecated setter functions pose a risk if misused but are marked deprecated, indicating intended obsolescence. Overall, the code is safe, with low security risk and no malware detected."
