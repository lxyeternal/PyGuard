  "purpose": "To determine the version of the 'qianfan' package, if installed.",
  "sources": "Import statements for importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata, and metadata.version() call for 'qianfan'.",
  "sinks": "metadata.version() call which retrieves package version information.",
  "flows": "Importing the module, attempting to access package metadata, assigning version string to VERSION.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard package version retrieval logic. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the appropriate import method based on Python version, then attempts to retrieve the version of the 'qianfan' package. If an error occurs during this retrieval, it defaults to '0.0.0'. The logic is straightforward, using standard Python library functions with exception handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple, standard package version check with safe fallback. It does not contain malware or security risks. The code appears benign and solely for version identification.",
