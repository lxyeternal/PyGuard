  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code attempts to import `metadata` from `importlib` (Python 3.8+). If that fails, it imports `importlib_metadata` (backport for older versions).\n- It then tries to get the version of the package `qianfan` via `metadata.version(\"qianfan\")`.\n- If an exception occurs (e.g., package not installed), it defaults `VERSION` to `\"0.0.0\"`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is straightforward, standard for version retrieval, with proper exception handling.\n- **Malicious activity?** No. No external data, no network calls, no code obfuscation, no suspicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation?** No, the code is clear and standard.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?** No. The code only reads package metadata, which is safe.\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Security risk:** None, as the code does not perform any harmful actions.\n\n---\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware:** All assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which aligns with the benign analysis.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since the code is standard, does not process untrusted data, and has no malicious behavior, a higher risk score (e.g., >0.5) would be unjustified.\n- The malware score is correctly 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and Recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard version retrieval snippet with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate in their analysis. The code is straightforward, safe, and has no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further detailed reasoning or review of additional code snippets.",
