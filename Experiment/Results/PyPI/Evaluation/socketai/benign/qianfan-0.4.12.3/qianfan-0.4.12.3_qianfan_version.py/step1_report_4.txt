{
  "purpose": "To determine the version of the 'qianfan' package, supporting compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'importlib.metadata' or 'importlib_metadata', and the call to 'metadata.version(\"qianfan\")'.",
  "sinks": "The 'metadata.version' call potentially retrieves package version information; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Imports -> attempting to import 'metadata' -> calling 'metadata.version(\"qianfan\")' -> fallback to default '0.0.0' if exception occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior. The fallback to '0.0.0' on exception is standard practice, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'metadata' for version retrieval, with compatibility handling for Python versions below 3.8. If the package 'qianfan' is installed, its version is fetched; if not, defaults to '0.0.0'. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious data handling. The code's purpose is straightforward, and it only reads package metadata without any external input or untrusted data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version detection snippet with proper compatibility handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The risk and malware scores are effectively zero.",
