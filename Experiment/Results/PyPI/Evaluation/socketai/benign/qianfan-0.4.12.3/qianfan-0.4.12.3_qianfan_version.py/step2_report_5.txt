  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet, which is a standard approach to retrieve package version info with compatibility handling for Python versions below 3.8.\n- The code employs typical import strategies and exception handling, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or external data flows.\n- The default fallback to \"0.0.0\" when the package isn't installed is a common pattern and not suspicious.\n- No external network interactions, secrets, or data leaks are involved.\n\n**Assessment of individual reports:**\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n- The purpose, sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, analysis, and conclusions are consistent and accurate.\n- The confidence is perfect (1.0), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- The reports are thorough and correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or risks are evident.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- The detailed reasoning confirms that this is a benign, standard package version retrieval snippet.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis code is a standard, safe utility snippet with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.",
