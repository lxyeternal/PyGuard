{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'qianfan' package, supporting multiple Python versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version using 'metadata.version' from the importlib.metadata module or its backport.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; the code only assigns a value to VERSION variable.",
  "flows": "The code imports version info from package metadata and assigns it to the VERSION variable; no external data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors. The try-except structure is standard for compatibility across Python versions.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'metadata' from 'importlib' (Python 3.8+). If that fails, it imports 'importlib_metadata' for older Python versions. It then tries to retrieve the version of the 'qianfan' package using 'metadata.version'. If this fails (e.g., package not installed), it sets VERSION to '0.0.0'. All operations are standard and have no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no external network interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version retrieval snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is intended for compatibility across Python versions and safely handles exceptions. No indicators of malware or security threats.",
