{
  "purpose": "To determine the version of the 'qianfan' package, supporting compatibility across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Importing 'metadata' from importlib or importlib_metadata, and retrieving the version of 'qianfan' package via 'metadata.version()'.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data is used in a way that could cause data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "The code imports the metadata module and calls 'metadata.version' with a static string; no dynamic or untrusted input flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a try-except block to handle import errors and fallback logic, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to determine the package version, employing compatibility handling for Python versions earlier than 3.8. It falls back to a default version string if the package is not installed. No external input, untrusted data, or malicious constructs are present. The exception handling is generic and safe, merely assigning a default version.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe version retrieval snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
