  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'qianfan' package, with fallback to '0.0.0' if not installed.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata to access package metadata; metadata.version('qianfan') to get version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only reads package metadata and assigns a variable.",
  "flows": "Source: metadata.version('qianfan') -> sink: VERSION variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with standard exception handling and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports package metadata handling modules, attempts to retrieve the version of 'qianfan', and defaults to '0.0.0' if an error occurs. It employs standard practices without obfuscation, external network activity, or malicious logic. No data leaks, secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The exception handling is generic and safe. The code's purpose is benign, and the logic is clear and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for package version retrieval with proper fallback. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are accurate and justified.",
