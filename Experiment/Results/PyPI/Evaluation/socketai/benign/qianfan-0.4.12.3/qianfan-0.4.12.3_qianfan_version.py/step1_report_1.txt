  "sources": "The code reads the package metadata using 'importlib.metadata' or 'importlib_metadata', and attempts to get the version of 'qianfan'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or harmful effects are present.",
  "flows": "Metadata version retrieval flows from the import statements to the 'VERSION' assignment, with exception handling providing a default value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are observed; the code performs a standard package version check with fallback.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard import techniques to retrieve package version info, with compatibility for Python versions below 3.8. Exception handling ensures robustness. No malicious or suspicious activities are evident; the code simply obtains version data or defaults if unavailable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign snippet aimed at retrieving package version information with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
