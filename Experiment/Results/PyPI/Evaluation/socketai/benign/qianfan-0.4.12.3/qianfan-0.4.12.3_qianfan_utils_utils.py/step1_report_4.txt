  "purpose": "Utility module providing functions for configuration management, package checking, ID generation, and async thread handling.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, function arguments, imported modules, and system socket for IP address.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable retrieval, package import checks, ID and token generation, socket connection for IP.",
  "flows": "Environment variable read to determine configuration, package check flow, ID generation, socket connection for IP retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "Use of secrets.choice for random ID generation; no hardcoded secrets or credentials observed. No obfuscated code or suspicious imports beyond standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of helper functions for configuration, package management, string manipulation, and asynchronous thread execution. No suspicious data flows, malicious system modifications, or hidden backdoors are present. The use of secrets for ID generation is standard for secure IDs. The environment variable handling is typical for configuration management. The socket IP retrieval appears normal, attempting to determine local IP. No anomalous or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility library with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It uses standard libraries and methods for configuration, ID generation, and environment checks, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
