  "purpose": "Utility functions for environment variable access, package verification, string manipulation, ID generation, threading, and network info retrieval.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, checks for package installation, connects to socket for IP address.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables, package imports, socket network calls.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variables, package checks, socket connection -> Sink: environment, network info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard utility functions commonly used in Python projects. It performs environment variable retrieval, package presence checks, string conversions, secure ID generation, and network info gathering. The socket connection in get_ip_address() connects to a non-sensitive address with exception handling, indicating benign intent. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The use of secrets.choice for ID generation is appropriate for security. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified. It is safe for use in production environments.",
