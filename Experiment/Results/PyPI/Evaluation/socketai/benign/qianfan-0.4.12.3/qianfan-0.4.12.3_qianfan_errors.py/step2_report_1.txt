  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling.\n- No external inputs, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard, benign part of an SDK’s error handling framework.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   - The code does not contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The only minor issue is a typo in class name `NotImplmentError` (should be `NotImplementedError`), but this is a coding mistake, not a security flaw.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   - The reports are accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and purely structural.\n   - No significant logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**  \n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable given the static analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n   - No issues warrant a risk score above 0.5; the code is straightforward exception class definitions with no malicious intent.\n   \n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   - All claims are based on static analysis and are reasonable.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made; the analysis is cautious and accurate.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the entire review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n  *No malicious behavior detected.*\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  *Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.*\n\n- **Risk:** 0.1  \n  *While the code is benign, the typo in class name `NotImplmentError` indicates a minor coding mistake, but not a security risk.*\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for an SDK, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor typo does not impact security but could be corrected for code quality.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo further action needed from a security perspective. The code is safe and should be considered low risk.",
