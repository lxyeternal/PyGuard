  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the Qianfan SDK",
  "sources": "Code imports, class definitions, and exception initialization methods",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external outputs",
  "flows": "None; no data flows from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "None; standard exception class definitions without unusual patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of exception classes for error handling within a library. It imports typing modules, defines several exception classes with clear purposes, and includes basic constructors for some classes. No external data handling, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be standard, well-structured error handling code for a Python SDK, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of exception class definitions for a Python SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is straightforward and serves its purpose for error management.",
