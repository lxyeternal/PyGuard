  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a library, likely related to API interactions and internal errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs; all error handling is based on internal exception classes.",
  "sheaves": "No untrusted data handling, input reading, or external data processing present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected. All classes are straightforward exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for error handling within a library, including API errors, argument validation, timeout, and internal errors. No code execution, input handling, or external interactions are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code. The license and copyright headers are standard and do not introduce risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely a set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
