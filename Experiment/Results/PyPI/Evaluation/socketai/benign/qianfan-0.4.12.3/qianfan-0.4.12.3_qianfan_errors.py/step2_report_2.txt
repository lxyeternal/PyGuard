  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the findings, scores, and overall security implications.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling.\n- No external input, data processing, network activity, or code execution is present.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard, benign error handling framework for an SDK.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- The code is static, with no dynamic or runtime behaviors that could introduce security risks.\n- Exception classes are straightforward, with proper inheritance and minimal constructor logic where needed.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present.\n- The licensing headers are standard and do not pose risks.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the clear, readable class definitions.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any operations that could compromise security.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- None identified. The reasoning and scoring are consistent and justified.\n- The reports are overly cautious but accurate; no need to adjust scores.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at 0.\n- No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely structural, with no malicious or security concerns.",
