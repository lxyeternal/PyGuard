  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the scoring, and the overall security implications.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines multiple custom exception classes for an SDK, including API errors, request errors, validation errors, and internal errors.\n- All classes are standard, inherit from Python's built-in Exception or a base custom exception.\n- There is no data processing, external communication, code execution, or dynamic behavior.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger, well-structured error handling framework.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n- The reasoning is consistent: static class definitions, no data flows, no external input handling, no suspicious patterns.\n- The confidence scores are high (1.0), and the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes, the code is straightforward class definitions. No issues or malicious code are present.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning?**  \n  No. The analysis correctly identifies the code as benign and purely structural.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  The malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n  The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with no obfuscation.  \n  The security risk score is 0, justified given the benign nature.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions?**  \n  The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as non-malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the comprehensive analysis, the code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n  No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n  Clear, straightforward class definitions.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0  \n  No security risk identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the code's static, benign nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
