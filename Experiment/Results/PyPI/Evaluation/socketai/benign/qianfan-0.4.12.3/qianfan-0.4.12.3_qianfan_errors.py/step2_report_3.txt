  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the scoring, and the logical consistency.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling.\n- No external input, data processing, network activity, or code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code appears to be part of a standard error handling framework for an SDK.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review:\n\n**Presence of issues in the code:**\n\n- The code matches the description: only class definitions, no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the code logic.\n- The class `NotImplmentError` has a typo in its name (\"Implment\" instead of \"Implement\"), which is a minor flaw but not a security concern. This typo does not impact security but could be flagged as a code quality issue.\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n\n- All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- These are reasonable given the code content.\n\n**Risk scores:**\n\n- Since there's no malicious activity, the risk score should be very low, close to 0.\n- Some reports give a risk score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- No report suggests a higher risk score, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Malware considerations:**\n\n- No malicious intent, no code execution, no external communication.\n- Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities:**\n\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is purely structural.\n- No issues with exception handling logic.\n\n**Obfuscation:**\n\n- All reports agree on obfuscated = 0, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a straightforward, standard set of exception class definitions.\n- No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no security risks.\n- The only minor note is the typo in `NotImplmentError`, which could be flagged for code quality, but not security.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores given in all reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- The risk and malware scores should remain at 0.\n- The typo in `NotImplmentError` could be corrected for code quality, but it does not affect security.\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\n**The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a very slight risk if considering the typo as a minor flaw, but generally negligible)\n\n**Final note:** The code is safe, and no further action is necessary from a security perspective.",
