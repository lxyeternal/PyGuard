{
  "purpose": "This code defines a collection of custom exception classes for the qianfan SDK, serving as error handling mechanisms.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only through class instantiation parameters in constructors, particularly in APIError and RequestError classes.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially be the error messages, request IDs, or request details passed during exception raising, but no external data flows are evident in this static code.",
  "flows": "The flow involves instantiating exception classes with error details; no dynamic or external data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in class name 'NotImplmentError' instead of 'NotImplementedError'; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The classes inherit from base exception classes and serve as structural components. The typo in 'NotImplmentError' is a minor coding mistake but not a security concern. Static analysis indicates no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for an SDK, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor typo does not impact security but could be corrected for code quality.",
