  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, with no data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard, benign error handling framework for an SDK.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), and the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Presence of malicious behavior:** None of the reports identify any malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Malware:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** None detected.\n- **Code logic:** The code is static, defining exception classes with straightforward inheritance and constructors.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is reasonable.\n- The overall security risk is 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n\n- The code is very simple and standard; there's no indication of any malicious intent.\n- The only possible concern could be if these exception classes are used in a malicious way elsewhere, but based solely on this code, there's no evidence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The provided code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for an SDK.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports seem appropriate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on this review, I would concur with the current scores: all zero, indicating no security concerns.",
