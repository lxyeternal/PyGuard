{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the qianfan SDK or library.",
  "sources": "Code does not read external input; it defines exception classes and their constructors.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only declares classes and exception handling logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions, including inheritance from Python's built-in Exception classes. The classes encapsulate error states such as API errors, request errors, authentication issues, and internal errors. No external data input, data manipulation, network activity, or code execution occurs. The code is purely structural for error handling and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or other potentially harmful actions. Overall, it is safe and benign.",
