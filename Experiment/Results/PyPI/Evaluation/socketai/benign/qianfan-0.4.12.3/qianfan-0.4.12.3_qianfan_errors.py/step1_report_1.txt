{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for a Qianfan SDK, handling various error scenarios related to API interactions and internal validation.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources; class definitions and exception initializations are static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or sensitive operations; primarily class and constructor definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; exception handling is straightforward and does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, with no input/output or dynamic code execution. It uses standard Python features and conventional class structures. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be part of a larger, clean error handling framework for an SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception classes used for error handling in an SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code's purpose is clear, and it contains no suspicious patterns.",
