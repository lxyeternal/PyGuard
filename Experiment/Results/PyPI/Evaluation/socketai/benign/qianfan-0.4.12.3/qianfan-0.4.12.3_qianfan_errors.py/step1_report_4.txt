  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the qianfan SDK.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all code consists of class definitions and imports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, network operations, or data output present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard class definitions and exception handling without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises a set of custom exception classes for error management in a Python SDK. It includes clear inheritance, proper use of __init__ methods where needed, and standard structure. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or obfuscated/complex code. No malicious or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. It appears to be a standard, benign library component.",
