  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a configuration module for the qianfan SDK.\n- They highlight that the code defines constants, environment variable names, enums, and default values.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data processing logic are present.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The environment variables and constants are standard and intended for SDK configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n- **Are issues present?**  \n  No. All reports agree that the code is purely configuration and constants with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes?**  \n  None identified. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.\n\n- **Scores and Justifications:**  \n  - **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports, which is consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n  - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation is detected.\n  - **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1), justified by the code being configuration data, not executable or risky code.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The code does not contain any dynamic code, code injection points, or network operations.\n- Environment variables are used as intended for configuration, not as vectors for malicious input.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are found.\n- The code is standard for SDK configuration modules.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal, mostly due to potential misconfiguration if environment variables are compromised, but no direct security threat.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The environment variables and constants are standard and do not pose an attack vector themselves.\n- The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic behavior that could be exploited.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed review, the code is a benign configuration module with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and align with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to potential misconfiguration, but not malicious)\n\nThis assessment confirms the code's safety and legitimacy.",
