  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:  \n   The provided code is a set of constants, environment variable names, enumerations, and default configuration values for the qianfan SDK. It does not contain any functions, dynamic code execution, network calls, or data processing logic. It mainly serves as a configuration module.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Elements**:  \n   - No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n   - No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - Environment variables are used as intended for configuration, not for malicious purposes.\n   - No signs of code injection, malicious payloads, or malicious data handling.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign very low or zero, indicating minimal security risk, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Anomalies**:  \n   - The only minor point is that environment variables could be manipulated if an attacker gains access to the environment, but this is standard for SDK configuration and not inherently malicious.\n   - No dynamic or executable code is present that could be exploited.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:  \n   The code appears to be a standard, well-structured configuration module for an SDK. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements. The high confidence scores and zero malware/obfuscated scores across reports are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 (very low, just noting that environment variables could be misused if compromised, but no direct malicious activity)  \n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign configuration/constants module with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.",
