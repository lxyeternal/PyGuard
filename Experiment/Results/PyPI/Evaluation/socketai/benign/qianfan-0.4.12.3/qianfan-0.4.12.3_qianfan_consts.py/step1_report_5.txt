{
  "purpose": "Defines constants, enums, environment variables, and default values for the qianfan SDK, facilitating interaction with Baidu's API services.",
  "sources": "Static data declarations, import statements, and class attribute initializations; no external or user input processing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing, network operations, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely establishes constants and configurations without dynamic data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists primarily of static class definitions, enumerations, and constant values used for SDK configuration. It imports standard modules and sets environment variable names and default values. There are no functions executing runtime logic, no user input handling, and no network or file operations. The code adheres to standard patterns for configuration and constants management, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration module for the qianfan SDK, containing no malicious behavior or security threats. It does not include any dynamic or executable logic that could be exploited or used maliciously.",
