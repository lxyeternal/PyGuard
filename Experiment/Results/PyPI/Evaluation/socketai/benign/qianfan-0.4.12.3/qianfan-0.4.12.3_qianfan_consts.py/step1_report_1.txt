{
  "purpose": "Defines constants, environment variables, and default configurations used in the qianfan SDK for API interactions, environment setup, and model specifications.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., QIANFAN_AK, QIANFAN_SK, QIANFAN_BASE_URL), imported modules (enum, Path, Set, version), and class attributes/constants.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include environment variables for credentials and URLs, configuration values (e.g., proxy, cache directory), and API route definitions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables into configuration settings, used during API requests and SDK initialization. No data flows indicate untrusted input to critical operations or code execution points.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Constants and environment variables are used as expected for SDK configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of class definitions and constants that establish configuration parameters for SDK operation. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data handling logic that could be malicious are present. All environment variable names are standard and intended for SDK configuration purposes. The code adheres to typical patterns for SDK setup, with no signs of malicious payloads or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration module for an SDK, primarily defining constants, environment variables, and default settings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attacks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
