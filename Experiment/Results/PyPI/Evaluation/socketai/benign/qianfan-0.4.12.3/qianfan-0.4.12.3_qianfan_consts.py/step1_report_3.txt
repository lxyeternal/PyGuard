{
  "purpose": "Defines constants, enums, environment variables, and default settings used by the qianfan SDK for API interactions and configurations.",
  "sources": "Constants, environment variable names, and default values are defined statically; no dynamic input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed; the code primarily sets static configuration parameters.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code does not handle or process external input directly.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard definitions and configuration setups; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for enums, constants, environment variable names, and default configuration values. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data processing is present. The static variables are intended for SDK configuration, with no signs of malicious intent. No obfuscation, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns are identified. Overall, the code appears to be a benign configuration and constants module for the SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration module defining constants, enums, and default environment variables for the SDK. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
