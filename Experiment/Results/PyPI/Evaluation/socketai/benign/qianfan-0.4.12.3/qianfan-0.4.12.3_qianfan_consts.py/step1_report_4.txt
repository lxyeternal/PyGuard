{
  "purpose": "Defines constants, environment variables, and default configuration values used in the qianfan SDK for API interactions, environment setup, and model management.",
  "sources": "Imports enum, Path from pathlib, VERSION from qianfan.version, and sets default environment variables and constants.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily defines static configuration data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted input to sensitive functions or outputs; no input validation or user data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected. All code appears to be straightforward definitions of constants, environment variable names, and configuration defaults.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions, constant assignments, and enum declarations. It imports standard libraries and a version variable. All values are hardcoded or derived from imports; no user input or external data sources are processed. There are no functions executing dynamic code, network communication, or file operations that could indicate malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present within the code. The environment variables listed are standard for SDK configuration. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a configuration and constants module for the qianfan SDK, containing no suspicious or malicious content. It performs no data processing, external communication, or code execution that could compromise security.",
