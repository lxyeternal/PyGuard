  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The provided code is a collection of class definitions, constants, environment variable names, enumerations, and default configuration values for the qianfan SDK.\n- It imports standard modules (`enum`, `Path`, `Set`) and a version variable.\n- It does not contain any functions, dynamic code execution, network operations, or data processing logic.\n- Environment variables are used for configuration, but only as string constants.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code appears to be a typical configuration module for an SDK.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and aligned with typical SDK configuration patterns.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Data flow:** No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only static configuration data.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No evidence of vulnerabilities such as code injection, secrets exposure, or insecure handling.\n\n### Logical or reasoning flaws:\n- The reports are consistent; they correctly identify that this is a configuration/constants module with no malicious intent.\n- No report suggests any malicious behavior, suspicious logic, or obfuscation.\n\n### Scores and justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All assign very low (around 0.1 or 0), which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Potential issues or concerns:\n- The only slight concern could be environment variable names or default values being overly permissive, but this is standard practice and not malicious.\n- No signs of supply chain attack, malicious code, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall malware score:**  \n- **Estimated:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- **Estimated:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- **Estimated:** 0.1 — very low, as this is purely configuration code with no executable logic or external data handling.\n\n**Confidence level:**  \n- High, given the consistent, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard configuration/constants module for the qianfan SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the observed code content and the analysis above.",
