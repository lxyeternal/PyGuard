{
  "purpose": "Defines constants, environment variable names, enums, and default configuration values for the qianfan SDK, serving as a static configuration module.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for credentials and configuration, class definitions, enum declarations, and constant values.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; only static constants and environment variable names are used.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; the code only declares static variables and enums without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration module containing constants, environment variable names, enums, and default values. It lacks functions, dynamic code, network calls, or data processing. No secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. Environment variables are used as intended for configuration purposes. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious indicators are detected. The code's structure and content suggest it is a standard, safe SDK configuration file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are accurate and consistent with its static, configuration-only nature. The supply chain risk is negligible.",
