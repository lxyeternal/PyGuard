{
  "purpose": "Defines constants, environment variables, enumerations, and default configurations for the qianfan SDK, facilitating API interactions and internal configurations.",
  "sources": "Imports enum, Path from pathlib, and VERSION from qianfan.version; environment variable strings; class attributes containing configuration values.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks handling untrusted input; environment variable names and configuration values could be manipulated if environment variables are compromised, but no direct malicious actions are performed.",
  "flows": "Configuration values and environment variable names are used for setting API parameters and environment settings; no data flows indicating malicious data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden logic. No hardcoded credentials or secrets present; environment variables are used conventionally.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of constant definitions, class attributes, and enumerations used for configuring SDK behavior. It imports standard modules and a version, and defines static configuration parameters and environment variable names. No functions execute any data processing, network calls, or file operations beyond path setup. There are no signs of malicious code, such as code injection, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. The structure and content appear to be straightforward configuration code, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a configuration module for the qianfan SDK, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It only defines constants, environment variable names, and default settings, which are standard in SDK design.",
