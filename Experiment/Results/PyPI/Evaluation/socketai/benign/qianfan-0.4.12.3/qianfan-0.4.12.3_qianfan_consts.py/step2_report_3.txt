  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as a configuration module defining constants, environment variables, enums, and default settings for the qianfan SDK.\n- They consistently note that the code is static, uses standard patterns, and lacks dynamic code execution, network calls, or data handling logic.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious patterns are identified across all reports.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, and confidence levels are high (mostly 1, with one at 0.9).\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step review:\n\n**1. Code presence and logic:**\n- The code is purely declarative: constants, enums, environment variable names, default values.\n- No functions, no data processing, no network operations, no code injection points.\n- Environment variables are standard for SDK configuration, not secrets or backdoors.\n\n**2. Anomalies or suspicious patterns:**\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- No signs of malicious payloads, code injection, or backdoors.\n- No signs of code obfuscation or unusual constructs.\n\n**3. Scores and reasoning:**\n- Malware score: 0 in all reports, which aligns with the code content.\n- Obfuscated: 0, as code is straightforward.\n- Risk score: very low (around 0.1), which is reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n**4. Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n- The code relies on environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., credentials). If environment variables are compromised, configuration could be misused, but this is standard practice, not malicious.\n- No runtime logic that could be exploited.\n\n**5. Consistency and reasonableness:**\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign configuration code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- **Should remain at 0.** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- **Should remain at 0.** Code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- **Should be very low, around 0.0 to 0.1.** The current 0.1 is reasonable, considering that misconfiguration of environment variables could pose operational risks but not security risks.\n\n**Additional considerations:**  \n- Since the code only defines constants and environment variable names, and no runtime logic is present, the potential attack surface is minimal.\n- The only \"risk\" is if environment variables are compromised, but that is outside the scope of this code's control.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                                 |\n|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | **0**           | No malicious code or payloads present.                         |\n| Obfuscated      | **0**           | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.                        |\n| Security Risk   | **0.0 - 0.1**   | Minimal operational risk; no security threat from static config.|\n\n**Overall, the code appears to be a standard, benign configuration module with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.**",
