{
  "purpose": "A helper class implementing a singleton pattern using a metaclass.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading points are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sink points where untrusted data could cause issues, as no data output or processing occurs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted inputs, as the code only defines a class structure.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton metaclass that ensures only one instance of classes using it is created. It employs a class variable _instances to store instances. The __call__ method controls object creation. The code is straightforward, standard, and does not include any data handling, external calls, or risky constructs. No hardcoded credentials, malicious backdoors, or obfuscated logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a singleton pattern using a metaclass. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity. It appears safe and intended solely for design pattern enforcement.",
