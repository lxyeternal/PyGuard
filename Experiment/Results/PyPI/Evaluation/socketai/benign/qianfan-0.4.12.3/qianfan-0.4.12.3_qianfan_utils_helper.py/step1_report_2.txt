{
  "purpose": "Define a singleton metaclass to ensure only one instance of a class is created.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent to external systems, files, or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code purely defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a singleton pattern with no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines a singleton metaclass with a class variable to store instances, and overrides __call__ to enforce the singleton pattern. It is a common design pattern implementation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. No external data inputs, network communication, or other suspicious activity is involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a singleton metaclass with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
