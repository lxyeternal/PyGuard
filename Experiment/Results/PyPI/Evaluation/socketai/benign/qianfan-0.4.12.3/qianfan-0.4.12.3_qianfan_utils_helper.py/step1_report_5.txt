  "purpose": "Define a singleton metaclass to ensure only one instance of a class is created.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ and typing, class definition, class variable _instances, __call__ method",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Class instantiation via __call__ method populates _instances and returns existing instance",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns; standard singleton implementation",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern using a metaclass. It initializes a class variable _instances to store singleton instances. The __call__ method checks if an instance exists for the class; if not, it creates and stores one, otherwise it returns the existing instance. The code relies on standard Python features and common patterns for singleton implementation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious data flow are present. The code appears benign and intended for ensuring singleton behavior in class design.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a singleton metaclass without malicious intent. No security risks or malware signals are detected. It is a standard design pattern implementation.",
