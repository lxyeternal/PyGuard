  "purpose": "Define a singleton metaclass for creating singleton classes.",
  "sources": "None; no input data reading from external sources or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written or transmitted to external systems.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process untrusted data or involve data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code implements a common singleton pattern using a class variable for instance storage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton metaclass 'Singleton' with a class variable '_instances' to store instances. The '__call__' method overrides class instantiation to ensure only one instance per class. There are no input, output, or external communications; the logic is standard for singleton pattern implementation. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present; the code appears to be a typical utility class for design pattern enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a singleton metaclass with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any data processing, transmission, or security-sensitive operations.",
