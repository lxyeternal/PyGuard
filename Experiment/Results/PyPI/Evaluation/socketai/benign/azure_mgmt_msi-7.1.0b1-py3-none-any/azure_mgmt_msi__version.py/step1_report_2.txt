  "purpose": "This code defines a version string for a software component, likely part of a larger SDK or library.",
  "sources": "The code reads a constant string assignment for VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks, no sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A - simple assignment with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains generated code comments and versioning info but no suspicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a version identifier and comments. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are present. The comments indicate generated code from a known tool, which is common in SDKs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign snippet establishing a version constant with no security concerns.",
