  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a static header with version and licensing info.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code, input/output handling, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.\n- The code is generated, as indicated by comments, which is common in SDKs and open-source modules.\n- The malware score assigned in all reports is 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets are simple variable assignments and comments.\n- No suspicious logic, data flows, or external interactions are present.\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable in their assessments.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- None identified. The scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is justified due to the straightforward analysis.\n\n**Risk and malware scores:**\n- Since the code is purely static metadata with no malicious activity, the malware score of 0 is correct.\n- The risk score of 0 is also appropriate, as there's no security concern.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The scores given in all reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports correctly identify this as a benign, auto-generated header with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
