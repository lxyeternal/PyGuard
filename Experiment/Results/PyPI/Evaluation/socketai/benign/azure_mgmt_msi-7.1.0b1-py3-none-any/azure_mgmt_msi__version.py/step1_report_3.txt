  "purpose": "Define the version of a software component, likely for package or module identification.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string '7.1.0b1' to the variable VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; the code is a straightforward version string declaration with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of licensing information, a version string assignment, and no other executable logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a standard header with versioning info, typical in open-source or generated SDKs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version identifier with licensing comments. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
