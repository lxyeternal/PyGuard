{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version string for a software component, likely as part of a larger codebase or generated code.",
  "sources": "The code reads only the string assignment to the variable VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are identified; only a simple string assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the comments are standard licensing and auto-generation notices.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of comments, a copyright/license notice, and a single version string assignment. There are no data inputs, outputs, or complex logic. The comments indicate the code is generated by an automated tool, which is common in SDKs or APIs. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, serving as a version indicator in a larger codebase. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are detected.",
