  "purpose": "This code serves as a static header containing licensing information and a version identifier for the software component.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it consists solely of comments and a variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code is static and does not handle data or control flow beyond variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward, static header with licensing comments and a version string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, generated header with licensing comments and a version variable assignment. It contains no dynamic code, input/output, or external dependencies. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious constructs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, metadata-only nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static header with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as such, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
