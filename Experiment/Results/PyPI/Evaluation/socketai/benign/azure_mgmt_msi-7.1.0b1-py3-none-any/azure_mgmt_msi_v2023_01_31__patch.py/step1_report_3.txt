{
  "purpose": "This code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code, specifically for Microsoft's Azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "The only data source is the module's import statements and comments, which do not involve untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely structural and documentation comments.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured Python module template with licensing comments, documentation, and a function definition. It contains no input handling, no external data processing, and no execution of untrusted data. The function 'patch_sdk' is a placeholder for customization but does not perform any actions or contain suspicious code. Overall, the code appears to be a benign template intended for developers to add custom SDK modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK customization template with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It contains no exploitable vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
