  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Patterns or Code:**\n   - The code is a minimal SDK customization template with licensing comments, an import statement, an empty `__all__` list, and a placeholder function `patch_sdk`.\n   - No data input/output, external data processing, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior is evident.\n   - The reports uniformly conclude benign intent, with confidence scores of 1 and malware scores of 0.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a benign, standard SDK template with no security concerns.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n   - No justification needed for higher scores, as the code does not pose any security risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n   - No malicious activity detected.\n\n6. **Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a template with no vulnerabilities.\n   - No speculative claims are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - No discrepancies observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a benign, boilerplate SDK customization template with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscated code. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is safe, standard, and intended for developer customization. No security concerns are present.",
