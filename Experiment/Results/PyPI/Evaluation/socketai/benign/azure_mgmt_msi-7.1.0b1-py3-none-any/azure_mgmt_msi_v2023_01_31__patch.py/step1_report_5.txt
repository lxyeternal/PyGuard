  "purpose": "The code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code, primarily containing documentation and a placeholder function for patching the SDK.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; the code does not handle input or data streams.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points are present; the code does not output or process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, containing only documentation, imports, and a placeholder function. No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a copyright notice, licensing information, documentation comments, an import statement, a list declaration, and an empty placeholder function. There are no data processing, input handling, or dynamic code execution elements. The function 'patch_sdk' is a safe placeholder intended for future customizations and does not perform any actions or contain malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template for SDK customization with no malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no suspicious patterns or malicious logic. The code is straightforward and safe.",
