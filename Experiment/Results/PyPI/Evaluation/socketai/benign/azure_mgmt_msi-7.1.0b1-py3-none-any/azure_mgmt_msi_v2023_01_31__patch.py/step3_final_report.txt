{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a template for customizing generated SDK code, allowing developers to implement specific modifications as needed.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from no external sources; it is a static template with no data inputs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code contains only a placeholder function with no data processing.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code does not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard SDK customization template with licensing comments, a module docstring, an import statement, an empty __all__ list, and a placeholder function 'patch_sdk'. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are detected. The code's simplicity and purpose are consistent with safe SDK customization practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, a standard SDK customization template with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence in this assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
