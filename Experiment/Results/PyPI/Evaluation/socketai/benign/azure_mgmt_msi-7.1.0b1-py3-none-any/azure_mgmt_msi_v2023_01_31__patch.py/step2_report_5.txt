  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a minimal Python module containing:\n     - Licensing comments.\n     - A module docstring.\n     - An import statement (`from typing import List`).\n     - An empty list declaration (`__all__: List[str] = []`).\n     - A placeholder function `patch_sdk()` with a docstring.\n   - There are no data inputs, external data sources, data sinks, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Logical and Security Flaws:**\n   - The report correctly identifies the code as benign, standard, and intended as a template for SDK customization.\n   - No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are detected.\n   - The code does not perform any operations beyond defining a placeholder function.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Risk Justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely structural and intended for developer use, the risk is negligible.\n   - No reason exists to assign a higher risk score.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified, as no malicious activity is present.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is justified, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities or hidden malicious intent are claimed.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate for this code.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign SDK customization template.\n- No security concerns, malicious activity, or obfuscation are present.\n- The assigned scores are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, as a precaution for any future modifications, but essentially negligible)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code is safe, standard boilerplate, and poses no security risk.",
