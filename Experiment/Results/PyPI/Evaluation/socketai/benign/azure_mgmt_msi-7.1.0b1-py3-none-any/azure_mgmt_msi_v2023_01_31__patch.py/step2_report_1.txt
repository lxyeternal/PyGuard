  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Structure**:\n   - The code is a minimal, standard SDK customization template.\n   - It contains licensing comments, a module docstring, an import statement, an empty `__all__` list, and a placeholder function `patch_sdk()`.\n   - There are no data inputs, external data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, standard boilerplate for SDK customization.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident.\n   - The code does not perform any actions beyond defining a placeholder function.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0, as no malicious activity or code is detected.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk score**: 0, given the benign nature and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as a safe template.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious code are justified here, given the simplicity.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's content.\n   - The high confidence levels are justified.\n\n**Overall Assessment**:\n- The code is a benign, standard SDK customization template.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n**My final estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analyses and the nature of the code.",
