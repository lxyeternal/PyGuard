  "purpose": "Placeholder template for customizing generated SDK code, providing a hook function for user modifications.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow endpoints, no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways, as the code is mainly structural with no data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code appears to be boilerplate, with a function intended for user customization and no apparent malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a licensing comment, an import statement, an empty list declaration, and a single function 'patch_sdk' with a docstring. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution mechanisms. The code is a standard template for SDK customization, with no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. No external dependencies or network interactions are present. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for developer use.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, boilerplate template intended for SDK customization with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
