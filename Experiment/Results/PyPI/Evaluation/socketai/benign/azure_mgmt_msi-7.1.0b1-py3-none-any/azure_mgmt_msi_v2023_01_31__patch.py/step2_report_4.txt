  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Characteristics:**\n   - The code is a minimal Python module with:\n     - Licensing comments (Microsoft, MIT License)\n     - A module-level docstring indicating customization\n     - An import statement (`from typing import List`)\n     - An empty list declaration (`__all__`)\n     - A placeholder function `patch_sdk()` with a docstring explaining its purpose\n   - No external data sources, no data sinks, no data flows, no dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code appears to be a standard SDK customization template.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Concerns:**\n   - **Malware:** The reports consistently assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious intent or behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, confirming the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n3. **Potential Issues or Anomalies:**\n   - The code is purely structural, with no executable logic beyond a placeholder function.\n   - The purpose is explicitly for customization, which is common in SDK templates.\n   - No signs of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n\n4. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 is appropriate; no security risks identified.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The code is benign, standard, and intended for safe customization.\n   - No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a safe, boilerplate SDK template with no security concerns.",
