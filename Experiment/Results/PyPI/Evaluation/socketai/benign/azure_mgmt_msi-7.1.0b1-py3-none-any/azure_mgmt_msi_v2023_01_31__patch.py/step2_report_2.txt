  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and evaluate the validity of their conclusions, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, standard SDK customization template, containing licensing comments, a docstring, an import, an empty `__all__` list, and a placeholder function `patch_sdk`.\n- No external data sources, inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are detected.\n- All reports uniformly conclude the code is benign, with high confidence, and assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Issues\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present in the code snippet.\n- **Malicious patterns:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risks:** None evident.\n\n### Evaluation of Each Report\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** All describe the code as a benign SDK template with no external data handling, no malicious code, and standard structure.\n- **Scores:** All assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, and confidence = 1.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Any discrepancies?**  \nNo. All reports are aligned with the code's actual content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review & Justification of Scores\n\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0, code is clear.\n- **Security risk score:** Correctly 0, no vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n**Potential for higher scores?**  \nNo, the code is purely structural and intended for developer customization. No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\nBased on the code and reports:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and justified. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- The code is a benign, standard SDK customization template.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores and conclusions. The code poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future modifications or integrations that could introduce risks, but as-is, this code is safe.",
