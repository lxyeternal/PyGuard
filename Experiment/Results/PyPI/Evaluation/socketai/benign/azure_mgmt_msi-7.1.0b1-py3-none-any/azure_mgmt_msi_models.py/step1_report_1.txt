  "purpose": "Importing models from a specific versioned module within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from '.v2023_01_31.models'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data handling or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; only an import statement without execution code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import syntax; no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a versioned submodule, likely part of a larger SDK or library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The import does not execute any code or handle untrusted data directly. The file contains only licensing comments and a single import statement, indicating minimal operational content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module import within a larger project. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
