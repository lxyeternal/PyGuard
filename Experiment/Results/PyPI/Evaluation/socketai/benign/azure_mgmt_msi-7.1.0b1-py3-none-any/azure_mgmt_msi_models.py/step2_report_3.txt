  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple import statement from a versioned submodule within a package.\n- No data flows, sinks, or external interactions are present.\n- No anomalies such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The code snippets are minimal and standard for SDK or library modules.\n\n**Assessment of individual reports:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - Confirms benign intent with high confidence (0.9).  \n   - No malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n   - The conclusion aligns with the analysis.  \n   - **Score appropriateness:** Correct.\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - Also confirms benign intent with full confidence (1).  \n   - No signs of malicious activity.  \n   - **Score appropriateness:** Correct.\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - Similar benign assessment with full confidence.  \n   - No anomalies or risks detected.  \n   - **Score appropriateness:** Correct.\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still indicates benign intent.  \n   - No malicious indicators.  \n   - **Score appropriateness:** Correct.\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - Confirms benign nature with full confidence.  \n   - No suspicious activity.  \n   - **Score appropriateness:** Correct.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n\n**Security Risk Scores:**\n- All are zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all, justified by the lack of any malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 for all, justified by the straightforward import statement.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 for all, as no security risks are identified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code fragment is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.",
