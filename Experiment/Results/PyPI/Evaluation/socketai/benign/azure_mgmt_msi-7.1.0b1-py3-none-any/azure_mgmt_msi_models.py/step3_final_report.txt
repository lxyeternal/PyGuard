{
  "purpose": "Import a versioned models module from the current package, likely as part of a larger SDK or library.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .v2023_01_31.models",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication present",
  "flows": "Import statement loads the module; no data flows or execution beyond module loading",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement with licensing comments, typical for SDK modules. It does not execute code or handle untrusted data. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The import from a versioned submodule suggests modular design. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified by the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign import statement within a larger package. No malicious or suspicious elements are present. The scores are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
