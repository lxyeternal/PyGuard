  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a standard SDK or module initialization script.\n- It imports local modules, sets version info, and attempts to apply optional patches.\n- No external or untrusted data inputs are involved.\n- No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The try-except block for patching is a common pattern but could potentially hide import issues, though not malicious.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is straightforward and matches the description; no issues are present.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The only minor concern is the silent handling of `ImportError` during the optional patching, which could mask underlying problems, but this is a standard pattern in SDK code and not malicious.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent and appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports (e.g., 0.1, 0.2). Given the code's benign nature, these are slightly overestimating but not unreasonable if considering the silent exception handling as a minor concern.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign risk scores above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- The minimal risk is justified by the standard pattern and lack of malicious activity.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Likely around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minor concerns about silent exception handling but overall very low.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to silent exception handling, but not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is standard SDK boilerplate with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The minor risk score reflects cautiousness about exception handling but does not imply a real security threat.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is benign.",
