  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code's actual content, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard SDK boilerplate, importing modules, applying optional patches, and setting version info. No suspicious behavior, no untrusted data, no malware.\n\n- **Code check:** The code only imports local modules, applies a try-except patch, and sets version info. No data processing, no external network, no secrets.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security risk: 0.1 (low). These seem appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on generated SDK code, no external data, no network activity, and no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Code check:** Same as above. The only potential concern is the silent try-except for patch_sdk, which could hide import issues but isn't malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security risk: 0. The low security risk is justified.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a generated SDK module, with a try-except that suppresses ImportError during patching. No malicious activity.\n\n- **Code check:** Same pattern. The silent exception could mask import problems but isn't malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security risk: 0.2 (slightly higher but still low). The increase is marginal and justified by the silent exception potentially hiding misconfigurations, not malicious intent.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SDK setup code, safe imports, optional patching, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Code check:** Consistent with previous. No data leaks, no network, no secrets.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security risk: 0. No issues.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with no signs of malicious behavior. The optional patch is handled safely.\n\n- **Code check:** Same as previous, straightforward module setup.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security risk: 0.1 or 0.2? The report assigns 0.1, which is reasonable.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall analysis:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is standard SDK boilerplate with no malicious payloads, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 or 0.2). Given the code's benign nature, these are reasonable. The only minor concern is the silent exception handling, which could mask import issues but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports — confirmed benign.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports — code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Should remain low, around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — the silent exception handling is a minor concern but not a security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate. The code is standard SDK setup, with no malware or obfuscation. The minor security risk score reflects the silent exception handling but does not indicate malicious intent.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
