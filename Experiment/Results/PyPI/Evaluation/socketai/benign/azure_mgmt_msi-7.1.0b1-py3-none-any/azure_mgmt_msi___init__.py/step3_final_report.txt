  "purpose": "Standard SDK module setup, importing classes, applying optional patches, and setting version info.",
  "sources": "Local module imports, version assignment, optional patch function call",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Import modules -> attempt patch -> set version",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling during patch import, which could mask import issues but is a common pattern in generated SDK code",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical auto-generated SDK setup script with no external data inputs, network activity, or malicious code. The try-except block for patching is standard but could hide import errors; however, it does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected. The benign nature is supported by the absence of any malicious or malicious-like behavior, and the code's straightforward structure confirms this.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor risk score reflects the silent exception handling but does not imply malicious intent. All reports' scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
