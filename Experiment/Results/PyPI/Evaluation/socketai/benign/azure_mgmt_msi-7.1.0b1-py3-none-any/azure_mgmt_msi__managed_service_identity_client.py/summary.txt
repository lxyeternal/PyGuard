  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SDK client implementation with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The only minor security consideration is the lack of validation for the 'api_version' input before dynamic import, which could be mitigated by whitelisting known API versions. Overall, the code is safe, with a very low risk profile primarily related to input validation rather than malicious behavior."
