  "purpose": "Placeholder for SDK customization, intended for future extensions or patches.",
  "sources": "No data inputs, external calls, or data flows; the function is empty.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks due to absence of logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and an empty function `patch_sdk()`. There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or logic. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The code is a benign placeholder or template for future SDK modifications, with no operational or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard placeholder with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify it as benign, and the scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
