  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm presence of issues in the code**  \n- The code snippets are minimal, consisting solely of license headers and an empty function `patch_sdk()`.  \n- No data inputs, outputs, external calls, or logic are present.  \n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the reasoning and conclusions**  \n- All reports correctly identify the code as a benign placeholder or template.  \n- They note the absence of data flows, external interactions, or suspicious code.  \n- The consistent conclusion across reports is that the code is safe and intended for future extension.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned**  \n- All reports assign:  \n  - Confidence: 1.0 (full confidence)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0  \n\n- These scores seem reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n\n**Step 4: Justify malware and risk scores**  \n- Malware score: 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity or payloads are evident.  \n- Security risk: 0 is appropriate; the code does not introduce vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge assumptions and claims**  \n- The reports assume the code is a benign placeholder, which is justified given the minimal content.  \n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are necessary; the code provides no functionality that could be exploited.\n\n**Step 6: Check for inconsistencies**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n- The reports do not overstate the risk; they correctly identify the code as a template with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward, non-malicious placeholder with no security concerns. The reports' evaluations are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is benign, serving solely as a stub for future SDK customization.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on this review, I would concur with the existing scores: **malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0**.",
