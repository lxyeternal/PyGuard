  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n- The code snippet is a standard license header and an empty function `patch_sdk()`.\n- No data inputs, outputs, external calls, or logic are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- All reports agree that this is a placeholder/template for future SDK customization.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the code is benign.\n- They correctly identify that the code is a stub with no operational logic, data flow, or malicious behavior.\n- No logical flaws or errors are evident in the reports.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - Purpose: clear and accurate.\n  - Sources, sinks, flows: none.\n  - Anomalies: none.\n  - Confidence: 1 (full confidence).\n  - Obfuscated: 0.\n  - Malware: 0.\n  - Security risk: 0.\n- These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- The risk score is 0 across all reports, which is justified because:\n  - The code is a benign placeholder.\n  - No data processing, external communication, or malicious logic.\n  - No evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**5. Malware Score Justification:**\n- Malware score is 0 in all reports.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity, nor does it contain obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n**6. Challenging Assumptions or Claims:**\n- All claims are reasonable and based on the code content.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are made beyond what is evident.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n- No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward placeholder with no operational logic, data flow, or external interactions. It is a standard SDK extension stub, which is common and benign. There is no evidence or suspicion of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No changes are necessary.",
