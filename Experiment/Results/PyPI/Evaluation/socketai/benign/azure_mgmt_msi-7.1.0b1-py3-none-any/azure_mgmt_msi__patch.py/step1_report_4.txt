  "purpose": "Placeholder for handwritten extensions to SDK-generated code, intended for customization.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input methods are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink since the function is empty and there are no other data interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only licensing and comment headers with an empty function definition; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and only includes licensing comments and an empty function 'patch_sdk()'. There are no input, output, or data processing operations. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are detectable. The structure and content are typical for a code stub or placeholder for manual extension.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a placeholder for future customization with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
