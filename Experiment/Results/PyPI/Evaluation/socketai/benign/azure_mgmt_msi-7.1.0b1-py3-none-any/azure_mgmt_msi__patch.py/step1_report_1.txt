  "purpose": "The code provides a placeholder function for SDK customization, intended for handwritten extensions to generated code.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this snippet.",
  "targets": "No sinks or data output points; the code contains no data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths since the function is empty and does not perform any operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, consisting solely of a license header and an empty function definition. No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The file contains a standard license header, with no active code beyond an empty function 'patch_sdk'. There are no data inputs, external calls, or logic that could be malicious. The code appears to be a template or placeholder for future customizations, typical in SDK extensions. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a stub for potential extensions. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, with no data flows or security concerns detected.",
