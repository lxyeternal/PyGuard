  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided details.\n\n**Overall code review:**\n- The code consists solely of a license header and an empty function `patch_sdk()`.\n- No data inputs, outputs, external calls, or logic.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- The code appears to be a template or placeholder for future SDK customizations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of malicious code or data:** None. The code is benign.\n- **Code logic or data flow:** Absent, as the function is empty.\n- **Suspicious patterns:** None.\n- **Obfuscation or hardcoded secrets:** None.\n- **Malware activity:** None.\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a benign placeholder or template.\n- The reasoning is sound; the code is minimal, with no data processing or external interactions.\n- The analysis correctly concludes no malicious behavior, no data flows, and no security risks.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the code's transparency.\n- The malware scores are 0, which is accurate.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is correct.\n- **Malware:** 0 is correct.\n- **Risk:** 0 is appropriate, as there is no security concern.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- Since the code is purely a placeholder with no active logic, the risk score should remain at 0.\n- The malware score is also 0, reflecting no malicious intent.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, given the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n**Estimated scores based on the code and reports:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is a benign template for future SDK customization.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard placeholder with no security issues.\n- The provided scores are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
