{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a placeholder or template for extending or customizing SDK functionality, specifically for patching or modifying SDK code.",
  "sources": "The code does not read any external input or data; it contains only comments and an empty function definition.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or points where untrusted data could be processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the code does not perform any operations or handle data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is largely composed of license comments and an empty function, with no actual implementation or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The file includes licensing information and a stub function intended for code patching or extensions. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modifications. The empty 'patch_sdk' function indicates an extension point rather than executable malicious behavior. There are no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or potentially malicious code elements present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template or extension placeholder with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and unrelated to any malicious activity or supply chain attack.",
