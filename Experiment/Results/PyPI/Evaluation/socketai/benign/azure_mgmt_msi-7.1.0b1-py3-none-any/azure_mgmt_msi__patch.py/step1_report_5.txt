  "purpose": "Placeholder function for handwritten extensions to generated code, specifically for SDK patching.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the function is empty and does not process data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with a standard license header and an empty function. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script contains a standard license header, followed by a simple function definition 'patch_sdk' that does nothing. There are no data inputs, external calls, or processing logic. The code appears to serve as a stub for future customization. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder with no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies. It does not perform any data handling or network operations.",
