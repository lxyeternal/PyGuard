  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a placeholder or template with an empty function (`patch_sdk()`).\n- No data inputs, outputs, external calls, or data flows are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.\n- The code is consistent across reports: minimal, licensing comments, and an empty function.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code does not contain any active logic, data processing, or external interactions. It is a benign stub.\n- **Malicious elements:** None are present; the code is a placeholder.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Data flows:** None.\n- **Security risks:** None.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; the code is a simple placeholder.\n- No logical errors or suspicious reasoning are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, unobfuscated code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or 0.5; given no security concerns, 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk score:\n- The code is a template with no active behavior, so the risk is negligible.\n- No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- Therefore, a risk score of **0** is justified.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Additional comments:**\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n| Metric            | Suggested Score |\n|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware           | 0               |\n| Obfuscated        | 0               |\n| Security Risk     | 0               |\n\n**This code is a safe, standard placeholder with no security concerns.**",
