  "purpose": "This code serves as a generated SDK module for Azure Managed Service Identity, handling imports, versioning, and optional patching.",
  "sources": "Imports internal modules, version info, and optional patch modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Imports -> version assignment -> optional patch import -> SDK class export",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (`from ._patch import *`) is generally discouraged but common in generated code; no malicious or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, generated SDK module with no external data handling, network activity, or sensitive operations. The wildcard import is a stylistic choice typical in auto-generated SDKs and does not introduce security risks. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The minimal risk concern is the wildcard import, which is acknowledged but not problematic in this context. All signals indicate benign, boilerplate code with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign SDK boilerplate with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor concern about the wildcard import is justified but does not elevate the security risk. The scores are appropriately low, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score of 0.1 due to the import style.",
