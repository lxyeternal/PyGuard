  "conclusion": "The code is benign SDK boilerplate with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor concern about the wildcard import is justified but does not elevate the security risk. The scores are appropriately low, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score of 0.1 due to the import style."
