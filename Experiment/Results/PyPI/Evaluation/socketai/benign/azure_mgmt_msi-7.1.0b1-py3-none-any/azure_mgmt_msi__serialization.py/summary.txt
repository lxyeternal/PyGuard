  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK utility with no malicious intent. The main security issue is the use of eval() for type conversions, which should be refactored for safety. No malware or obfuscation detected. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.4) due to eval() usage, but the code does not currently pose an active threat."
