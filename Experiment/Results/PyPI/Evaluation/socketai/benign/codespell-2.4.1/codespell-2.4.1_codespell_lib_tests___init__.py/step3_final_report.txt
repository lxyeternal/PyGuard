  "purpose": "The code appears to perform benign data processing or utility functions without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, user input, external files, or network sources as input data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to files, executes system commands, or communicates over the network, but no suspicious activity is observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs), with no evidence of malicious or suspicious paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. The confidence in benign nature is high (0.8), malware likelihood is zero, and the security risk is low (0.2). The absence of suspicious flows or anomalies supports this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malware. The scoring is consistent with the analysis, indicating a low security risk and no malicious intent.",
