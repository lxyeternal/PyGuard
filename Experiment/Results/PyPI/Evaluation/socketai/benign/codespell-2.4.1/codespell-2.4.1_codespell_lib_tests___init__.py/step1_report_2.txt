{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, potentially designed for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly present; no user input, environment variable access, or network calls are evident.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious output sinks such as network transmissions, file modifications, or system commands are identified.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks are observed within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual language features are present. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed step-by-step, including header, middle, and tail sections. It employs standard Python functions and constructs without employing dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. There are no signs of malicious activities such as network communication, system manipulation, or data exfiltration. The absence of external inputs or outputs further supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this analysis, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign Python script with no indicators of malware or security threats.",
