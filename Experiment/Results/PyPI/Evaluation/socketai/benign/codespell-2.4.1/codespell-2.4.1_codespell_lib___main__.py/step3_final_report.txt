{
  "purpose": "Minimal CLI entry point that imports and executes '_script_main()' from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import of '_script_main' from local '_codespell' module; no external input read directly.",
  "sinks": "Execution of '_script_main()' which may contain sinks; not visible here.",
  "flows": "Script execution flow: import -> if __name__ == '__main__' -> sys.exit(_script_main()).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI bootstrap that delegates logic to '_script_main()'. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The security profile depends on '_script_main()' implementation, which is not provided. Based solely on this snippet, no malicious or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible; the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0. The assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code.",
