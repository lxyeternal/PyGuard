{
  "purpose": "This script serves as an entry point that runs the main function of the _codespell module when executed directly.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the command-line environment via the 'sys' module.",
  "sinks": "The 'sys.exit' function is called with the result of '_script_main()', which could potentially influence process termination.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments flows into '_script_main()' indirectly; its output then flows into 'sys.exit'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is minimal and straightforward, invoking a main function.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'sys' module and a local module '_codespell'. It checks if the script is run as the main program, then calls '_script_main()' from '_codespell' and exits with its return code. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or suspicious patterns are present. The structure is typical for a command-line utility entry point, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple CLI entry point, executing the main script logic and terminating accordingly. No malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
