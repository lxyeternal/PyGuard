  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code sections involving dynamic eval/exec, suspicious imports, hardcoded secrets, or unusual data flows.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections to suspicious domains, system modifications, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "From obfuscated or suspicious input sources through dynamic execution or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation score (0.8), use of eval/exec, suspicious imports, or hidden logic without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution features, indicating potential malicious intent. The suspicion is supported by high obfuscation (0.8) and moderate malware likelihood (initially 0.4). Given the evidence, increasing the malware score to 0.6 better reflects the potential risk. Other reports lack suspicious features, with scores appropriately set to zero or low. The overall risk aligns with the suspicion level, warranting further analysis for Report 1. No evidence of malicious payloads or backdoors was identified in benign reports.",
  "conclusion": "Report 1 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, suggesting moderate malicious potential; therefore, its malware score should be increased from 0.4 to 0.6. Other reports are benign with appropriate scoring. Further runtime analysis is recommended for Report 1 to confirm malicious intent.",
