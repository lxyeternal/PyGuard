  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility tasks, with no explicit comments indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input functions or external files (if any). Specific sources are not evident due to absence of input or file reading code in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, or system commands, but none are explicitly visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Without concrete code, no clear data flow from source to sink can be identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are observed. The code uses standard syntax and language features without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The provided code lacks identifiable sources of untrusted data, sinks that could leak data or perform malicious actions, or complex flows that indicate malicious behavior. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. The overall structure appears straightforward and benign based on the given snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign Python script without malicious intent.",
