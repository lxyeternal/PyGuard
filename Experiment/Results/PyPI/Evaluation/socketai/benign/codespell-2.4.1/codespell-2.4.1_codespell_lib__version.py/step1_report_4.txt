  "purpose": "Define version information for a package generated by setuptools_scm",
  "sources": "Assignment statements for version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple)",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static version assignments only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is standard version declaration with conditional typing",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares version information variables, with a conditional import for typing hints. It assigns fixed version strings and tuples, with no external input, network operations, or sensitive data handling. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
