  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation**:\n   - The code is a straightforward version declaration script, with no dynamic or external data inputs.\n   - It contains static version strings and tuples, with conditional type hinting imports.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data processing.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The code is standard for package versioning, generated by setuptools_scm.\n   - The reports correctly identify the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Review**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, which seems appropriate given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n   - The risk scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - None of the reports suggest any potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - The code is static, with no external inputs, network activity, or obfuscation.\n   - Therefore, risk scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score**:\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code contains no malicious behavior or payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports avoid making unfounded assumptions; they recognize the code as standard version management code.\n   - No overreach or speculation about vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, standard, and poses no security risk.**",
