{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and version tuples, including the import inside a TYPE_CHECKING block.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; all assignments are static.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING conditional import and static version assignment; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version information for the package, with a conditional import for type hints that doesn't execute at runtime. All version values are hardcoded. There are no external inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors that could be malicious. The structure and content follow common patterns for version management generated by setuptools_scm, and no obfuscation or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration script generated by setuptools_scm. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are present.",
