  "purpose": "Define version information for the package, generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string '__version__' and tuple '__version_tuple__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; static assignment only.",
  "flows": "Static version string assigned to multiple variables; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version metadata with static strings and tuples, generated by setuptools_scm. It contains conditional type hinting imports which do not pose security risks. There are no external inputs, network operations, or data leaks. The version information is hardcoded in a standard, safe manner, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, safe, and typical version definition fragment. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
