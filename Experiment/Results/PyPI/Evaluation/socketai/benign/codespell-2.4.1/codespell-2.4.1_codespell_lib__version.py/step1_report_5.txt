{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a package, generated by setuptools_scm, and does not perform any runtime actions or data processing.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version strings and tuples, no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the version info is hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; the code is straightforward and standard for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables, including __version__, version, __version_tuple__, and version_tuple. It conditionally imports typing constructs when TYPE_CHECKING is True but otherwise assigns static version info. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no obfuscated code, and no malicious constructs present. The code's sole purpose is to maintain version metadata for the package.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign version metadata definition generated by setuptools_scm, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
