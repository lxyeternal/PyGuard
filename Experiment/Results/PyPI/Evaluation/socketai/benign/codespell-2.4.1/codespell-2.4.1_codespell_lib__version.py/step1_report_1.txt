{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, primarily used for tracking and managing package versions during development and distribution.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings (__version__ and version variables). No input or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage. The code only assigns static version data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; version information is statically assigned and not influenced by external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors detected. The code contains typical version definition patterns with no dynamic or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports type annotations for type checking purposes and defines version variables both as strings and tuples. All version data are hardcoded static values. No external input, environment variables, or dynamic execution is present. The structure and content are straightforward and typical for package versioning, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard version declaration script for a Python package, with no malicious code, suspicious behaviors, or security risks identified. It merely defines version metadata.",
