{
  "purpose": "Define static version information for the package, generated by setuptools_scm, with no dynamic behavior.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings (__version__, version) and version tuples (__version_tuple__, version_tuple); conditional import for type hints.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment of version info without external inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, generated, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, generated version declaration with conditional type hinting imports. It contains no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious or suspicious behavior. All signals indicate benign, standard package metadata code. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration generated by setuptools_scm. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
