  "purpose": "String casing adjustment based on the pattern of the input word, for formatting purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'word' to determine casing; 'fixword' as the string to transform.",
  "sinks": "Return value of the function; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'word' is checked for casing; 'fixword' is transformed accordingly and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward string manipulation with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility that adjusts the casing of 'fixword' based on the casing pattern of 'word'. It checks if 'word' is capitalized or uppercase and transforms 'fixword' accordingly. There are no external inputs, network calls, obfuscation, or malicious code. The logic is deterministic and benign, serving purely formatting purposes. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with high confidence scores. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign string formatting utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
