{
  "purpose": "Exports functions and version information for a Python package related to codespell",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: ._codespell and ._version",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to security effects",
  "flows": "Imported functions and version are exposed via __all__, no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard module import and export pattern, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal functions _script_main and main from a local module, and __version__ from another local module. It then defines __all__ to specify public API. The code structure is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. It appears to serve as an interface or entry point for a package, with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module export pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not read untrusted input, perform any dangerous operations, or contain hidden malicious logic.",
