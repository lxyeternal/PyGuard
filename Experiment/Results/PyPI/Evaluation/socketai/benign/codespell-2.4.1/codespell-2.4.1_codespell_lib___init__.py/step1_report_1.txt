  "purpose": "This code exports functions and version information from internal modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._codespell (for _script_main and main), ._version (__version).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; just module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions and version info from internal modules, then exposes them via __all__. No external input, no network, no data processing or insecure operations. It appears to be a standard module __init__ pattern, ensuring that specific functions and version info are accessible. No signs of malicious intent, suspicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module initialization that exports specific functions and version info. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
