  "purpose": "Module initialization exporting functions and version info",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._codespell and ._version",
  "sinks": "None; static import and export only",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and version info from internal modules and exposes them via __all__. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The code structure is typical for a package's __init__.py, with no suspicious or malicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The security and malware scores are correctly set to 0, reflecting the benign nature. The confidence score is high (1), as the static analysis confirms no issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module initialization pattern with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The existing scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
