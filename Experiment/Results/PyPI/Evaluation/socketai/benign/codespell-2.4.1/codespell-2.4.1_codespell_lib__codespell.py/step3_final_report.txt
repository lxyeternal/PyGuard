{
  "purpose": "A command-line spell checker that processes files, applies regex-based corrections, handles encoding detection, and interacts with users for manual fixes.",
  "sources": "Reads input files, configuration files, and user input via prompts.",
  "sinks": "Outputs warnings, corrections, summaries, and modified files; no network or external data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Source data from files and user input flows into regex processing, correction application, and output; optional in-place file modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious network activity, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, and no hidden payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured CLI utility for spell checking. It uses common external modules like chardet and custom modules (_spellchecker, _text_util). It performs file I/O, regex filtering, encoding detection, and user interaction. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or sabotage are present. The external dependencies are typical for such tools, and the code's flow aligns with legitimate utility behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, open-source spell checker with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The low risk scores are justified given its functionality and external dependencies.",
