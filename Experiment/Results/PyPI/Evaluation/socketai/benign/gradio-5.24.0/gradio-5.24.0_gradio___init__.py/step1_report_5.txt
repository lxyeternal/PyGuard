{
  "purpose": "This code primarily imports various modules, components, and utilities from the Gradio library for building interactive web interfaces and tools.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from imported modules, standard library functions, and environment (via get_package_version). No user input or untrusted data sources are directly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or where untrusted data could cause harm such as system commands, network connections, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident; the code mainly sets up module imports and defines an __all__ list for exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code consists solely of import statements and module setup, with no obfuscated or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules and classes from the Gradio library, which is used for creating web interfaces. It dynamically imports some components based on environment conditions. The __all__ list enumerates all exported components for external use. No user input handling, network activity, or system modifications are present. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a standard library initialization script, setting up module exports.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this code. It is a standard setup file for a library with no suspicious or harmful constructs.",
