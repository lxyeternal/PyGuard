{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the main module for the 'gradio' library, primarily importing various components, utilities, and setup functions to establish the package's namespace and API.",
  "sources": "The code reads data only from static import statements; no untrusted input sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only performs imports and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code does not process external data or execute dynamic code.",
  "anomalies": "Minor inconsistencies in naming conventions (e.g., 'AnnotatedImage' vs. 'Annotatedimage') are likely typographical and do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for the 'gradio' package, consisting solely of import statements and the definition of the public API via __all__. It does not include any network activity, data processing, or obfuscated code. The conditional import based on 'IS_WASM' is standard for environment-specific setup. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard library initialization module with no malicious intent or security risks. The code's purpose is to organize and expose the components of the 'gradio' package, and it does so without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
