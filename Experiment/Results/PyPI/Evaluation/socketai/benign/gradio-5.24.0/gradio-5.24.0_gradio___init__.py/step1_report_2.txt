{
  "purpose": "This code primarily consists of import statements, module setup, and an export list for a Python package related to Gradio, a framework for building machine learning demos and interfaces.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard library imports and module-level attribute access, such as 'get_package_version()'. No user input or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks, such as network calls, file writes, or execution functions, within this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The code structure is standard for a Python package's initialization file (__init__.py).",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package initialization module that imports various submodules, classes, and functions from the 'gradio' package and related modules. It then defines __all__ for public API exports. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external communications are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign package setup script for the Gradio library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
