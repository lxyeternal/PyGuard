  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for setting up network tunnels, managing TLS certificates, and checking URL accessibility.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, fetches API responses for certificates, and accepts URL inputs for verification.",
  "sinks": "Writes certificates to disk, initiates network tunnels, and performs HTTP HEAD requests with SSL verification disabled.",
  "flows": "Fetches API data -> writes certificate -> creates Tunnel object -> starts tunnel; URL check reads URL -> performs HTTP HEAD with verify=False -> returns status.",
  "anomalies": "Disabling SSL verification (`verify=False`) in HTTP requests; trusting external API data without validation; writing certificates without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for network tunneling and URL validation. It fetches certificates from an external API and writes them to disk, then establishes tunnels. The URL check function disables SSL verification, which is a security concern but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present. The main risk stems from insecure SSL practices and trusting external API responses without validation, which could be exploited in man-in-the-middle attacks but does not constitute malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for tunneling and URL checking. The primary security issue is the disabling of SSL verification (`verify=False`), which should be addressed in production environments. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0. The security risk score should be around 0.3 to 0.4, reflecting the insecure SSL practices but no malicious intent.",
