  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and determine appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code sets up tunnels, writes certificates, and checks URL availability. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are evident. The only concern is `verify=False` in `httpx.head()`.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — low, justified by the insecure SSL verification.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence based on analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar functions, with emphasis on insecure SSL verification (`verify=False`). No hardcoded credentials or backdoors.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.3 — slightly higher, justified by the insecure SSL practices.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights that certificates are fetched and written without validation, and SSL verification is disabled in URL checks. These practices could be exploited but are not inherently malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** 0.4 — justified given the insecure SSL handling.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar points about SSL verification being disabled and potential risks. No malicious behavior identified.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on SSL verification being disabled and external API reliance, with potential security implications but no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.3 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variations but generally justified by the insecure SSL practices.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The malware scores across all reports should remain at **0**, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated scores should stay at **0**.\n- The security risk scores are appropriate, reflecting concerns about `verify=False` but not indicating malicious intent.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Security risk:** 0.3 — due to insecure SSL practices, but not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The main security concern is the use of `verify=False`, which should be addressed in production code but does not constitute malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No adjustments needed to the scores; the analysis aligns well with the code's behavior and the reports' reasoning.",
