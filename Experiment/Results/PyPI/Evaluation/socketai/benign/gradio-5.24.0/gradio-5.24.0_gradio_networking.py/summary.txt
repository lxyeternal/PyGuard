  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for tunneling and URL checking. The primary security issue is the disabling of SSL verification (`verify=False`), which should be addressed in production environments. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0. The security risk score should be around 0.3 to 0.4, reflecting the insecure SSL practices but no malicious intent."
