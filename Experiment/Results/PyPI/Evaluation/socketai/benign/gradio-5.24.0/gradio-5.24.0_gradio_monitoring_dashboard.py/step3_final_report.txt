{
  "purpose": "A Python script that creates a Gradio-based monitoring dashboard with simulated data for visualization and filtering.",
  "sources": "In-memory data generated within the script during execution; no external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "Visualization outputs within the local application; no external data transmission or network activity.",
  "flows": "Generated data flows from creation in the main block to filtering and visualization functions upon user interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. Session hashes are small numeric ranges but are part of dummy data.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a dashboard with simulated data, which is generated internally without external inputs or network activity. No malicious or suspicious code segments are present. The data is used solely for visualization purposes, and the code structure is straightforward and readable. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The small session hash range is a minor point but not indicative of malicious intent. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is purely for demonstration or testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, internally used dashboard with simulated data, showing no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data leaks. The existing security assessments and scores are appropriate and justified.",
