{
  "purpose": "The code creates a monitoring dashboard for visualizing request data over time, including filtering by functions and time range, with sample data generation.",
  "sources": "Data generated at the end with random values assigned to data['data'], specifically in the for loop populating 'data'.",
  "sinks": "The data is used to generate a pandas DataFrame and visualized using Gradio components; no untrusted data outputs or network transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Generated data flows from the random data creation into DataFrame construction, which then feeds into visualization components; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Data is generated randomly and is used solely within the visualization; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are detected. No external network calls or data leaks are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Gradio-based dashboard with static data generation, visualization, and filtering functionalities. Data is created randomly within the script, used locally for plotting. No external inputs are received from untrusted sources, and no network activity, credential handling, or file manipulations occur. The data flow is internal, and no anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected. The overall structure appears standard for a dashboard visualization tool with sample data, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dashboard implementation with internally generated sample data. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or supply chain attacks. It functions solely for visualization purposes without external dependencies for data input or output, posing no security threats.",
