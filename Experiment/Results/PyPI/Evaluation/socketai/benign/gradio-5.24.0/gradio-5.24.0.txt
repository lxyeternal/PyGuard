No malware or obfuscation is present. The potential risk stems from executing external code, which is inherent to the design but not a flaw in the code itself."

      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for managing network tunnels, with proper integrity checks and process management. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The primary risk stems from executing an external binary, but checksum validation mitigates this. The overall security posture is acceptable under the assumption that the source and checksum are trustworthy."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for tunneling and URL checking. The primary security issue is the disabling of SSL verification (`verify=False`), which should be addressed in production environments. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0. The security risk score should be around 0.3 to 0.4, reflecting the insecure SSL practices but no malicious intent."
