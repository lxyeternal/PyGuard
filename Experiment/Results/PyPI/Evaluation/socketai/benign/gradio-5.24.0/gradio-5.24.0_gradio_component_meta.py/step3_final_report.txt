{
  "purpose": "The code manages extraction of class source code, generates type stub (.pyi) files for Gradio components, and updates stub files accordingly. It facilitates static type hinting and component event registration within the framework.",
  "sources": "Reads class source code via inspect and ast; reads and writes to .pyi files; uses template rendering with controlled inputs.",
  "sinks": "Writes to .pyi files; no untrusted data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Source code extraction from class definitions -> template rendering -> file modifications or creation.",
  "anomalies": "Uses template rendering without explicit input sanitization, but inputs are from source code or controlled data; no code injection or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis and code generation tasks typical for development tooling. It extracts class source code using ast, renders templates for type stub files, and manages file updates. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or backdoors. The use of source code parsing and file manipulation is standard and controlled. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and potential minimal risks associated with dynamic code generation and file handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing component interface definitions and type stub files within the Gradio framework. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
