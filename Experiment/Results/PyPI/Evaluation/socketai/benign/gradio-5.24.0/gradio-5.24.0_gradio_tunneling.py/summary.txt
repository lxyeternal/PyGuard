  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for managing network tunnels, with proper integrity checks and process management. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The primary risk stems from executing an external binary, but checksum validation mitigates this. The overall security posture is acceptable under the assumption that the source and checksum are trustworthy."
