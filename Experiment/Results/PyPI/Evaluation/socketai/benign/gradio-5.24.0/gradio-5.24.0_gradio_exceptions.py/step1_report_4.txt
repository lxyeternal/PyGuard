{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various error scenarios in a Gradio-based application, including user-visible errors via modal dialogs.",
  "sources": "Class and function definitions, import statements, exception initializations, and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__(self.message) in Error class, which initializes the base Exception with a message.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of Error class with a message, leading to __init__ and __str__ methods being invoked.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings and standard initialization. It includes a custom Error class designed for user-facing error messages in a UI modal. The code imports a documentation decorator and defines multiple error types, with some aliasing for backward compatibility. All classes are standard and follow typical Python patterns. No data flows to external systems, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward collection of custom exception class definitions for a Gradio application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears safe and intended solely for error handling.",
