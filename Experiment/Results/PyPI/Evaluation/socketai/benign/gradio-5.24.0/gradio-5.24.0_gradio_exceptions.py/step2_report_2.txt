  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for various exception types and a documentation decorator. There are no active code flows, network calls, data processing, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The classes serve as error containers and user notification mechanisms within the Gradio framework.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is straightforward, safe, and solely for error handling and documentation.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the analysis; the conclusions about the code's benign nature are consistent with the code content.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence level is 1 in all reports, justified by the clear and standard nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The code's purpose is purely for error handling and documentation, with no malicious or security-compromising behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - No malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's content.\n   - They correctly identify the code as standard exception class definitions.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's content and purpose.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard set of custom exception classes for the Gradio framework.\n- No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The reports are accurate and justified in their conclusions.\n\n**My Final Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is purely for defining error classes and documentation, with no malicious or security-threatening elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
