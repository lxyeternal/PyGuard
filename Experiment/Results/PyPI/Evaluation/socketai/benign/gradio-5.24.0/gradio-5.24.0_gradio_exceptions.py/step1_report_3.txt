  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the gradio framework, including user-facing error modals.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception initializations, no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions and creating error modal objects, potentially displaying messages to users.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and raising, used to control error handling flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various exception types, including user-visible errors with customizable messages. It leverages Python's exception handling without any external data input, network operations, or code injection mechanisms. The Error class is designed for displaying user messages via a modal, but it does not perform any malicious activity. All classes serve as error containers or for control flow; none contain suspicious logic or hidden backdoors. Overall, the code appears safe, standard, and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes used for error handling in the gradio framework. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The presence of user-facing error messages is legitimate and typical for UI frameworks.",
