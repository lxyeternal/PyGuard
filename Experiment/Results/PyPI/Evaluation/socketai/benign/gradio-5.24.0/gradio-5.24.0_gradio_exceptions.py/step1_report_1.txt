  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the Gradio framework, with some documentation support.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, __future__ import, and documentation import",
  "sinks": "Exception raising points, especially in Error class for user-visible error messages",
  "flows": "Error conditions triggered within the application logic, mainly for user notifications and internal error handling",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns present; the code primarily consists of class definitions and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple custom exception classes for error handling in the Gradio library. These include specific errors like DuplicateBlockError, InvalidComponentError, and several others related to application state. The Error class is designed to display user-facing error modals with configurable messages, durations, and titles. There are no indications of data leakage, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious code. The code appears purely for error management and documentation purposes, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard for defining error classes and documentation in a library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is focused on exception handling and user notifications within the framework.",
