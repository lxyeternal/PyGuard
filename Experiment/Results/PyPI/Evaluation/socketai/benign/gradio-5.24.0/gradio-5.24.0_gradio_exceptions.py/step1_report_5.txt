{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and documentation for the Gradio library, primarily used for creating interactive demos and web interfaces.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, exception raising points, and the documentation decorator",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; exception classes are static definitions, and no runtime data processing is shown",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hidden logic, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward class and function definitions with no dynamic or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes for error handling within the Gradio framework, along with documentation decorators. All classes are standard and contain no executable code that processes untrusted input or performs actions beyond raising exceptions or defining structure. No potential security issues, malicious behavior, or data leakage points are evident. The structure and content are consistent with library definition code intended for error handling and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and intended solely for defining error types and documentation within the Gradio library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
