{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling within the Gradio library, including user-facing error modals.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data only from method parameters (e.g., message, duration, title) when raising errors.",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions and creating error modals for user display; no untrusted data flow to system or network.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and raising with static or parameter-based messages; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious logic; no code injection, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines custom exception classes with detailed docstrings and parameters. It uses standard Python exception patterns. No external data inputs or outputs, no network connections, or code execution from untrusted sources are present. The Error class is designed to display user-friendly messages via UI modals. Overall, the code appears to be safe, purpose-focused, and free from malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a set of exception class definitions for error handling in the Gradio framework, with no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks detected. It functions solely for user error reporting and internal exception management.",
