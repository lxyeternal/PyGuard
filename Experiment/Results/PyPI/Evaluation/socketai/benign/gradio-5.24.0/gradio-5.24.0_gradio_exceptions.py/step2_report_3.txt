  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step to assess the security implications, potential risks, and the accuracy of the provided scores.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines multiple custom exception classes used within the Gradio framework.\n- The classes include both internal errors (e.g., DuplicateBlockError, InvalidComponentError) and user-facing errors (e.g., Error class for modals).\n- The Error class is designed to display user notifications with configurable parameters.\n- The code is purely structural, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  The code matches the description—it's a set of exception class definitions, documentation, and a user-facing Error class. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is standard for error handling, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors. They correctly note the absence of secrets, network activity, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores assigned in the reports:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  The code does not perform any malicious actions—no network calls, no code injection, no data exfiltration. The malware score should remain **0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated. Score should be **0**.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Since the code is purely for error handling and documentation, and no malicious or insecure patterns are present, the overall security risk should be **0**.\n\n- **Potential issues or assumptions:**  \n  All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent. They recognize the code as standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely structural, intended for error handling, and contains no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. They correctly identify that the code is standard, safe, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that any future code involving dynamic data processing, network activity, or external inputs is carefully scrutinized for security risks.",
