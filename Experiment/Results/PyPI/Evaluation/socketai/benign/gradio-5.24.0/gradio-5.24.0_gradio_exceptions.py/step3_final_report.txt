{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes for error handling and user notifications within the Gradio framework, including a user-facing Error class for displaying modal dialogs.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exceptions and the documentation decorator; no external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code does not contain runtime data flows; it only defines classes used elsewhere in the application.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling and user notifications, with comprehensive documentation. It does not perform any network activity, data processing, or dynamic execution. The classes serve as error containers and user interface elements, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, security risk is 0, and obfuscation score is 0, consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of exception classes used for error handling within the Gradio framework. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
