  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions and a documentation decorator. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscated logic. The classes serve as error containers and user notification mechanisms within the Gradio framework.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is purely for error handling and documentation, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. They emphasize the absence of secrets, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, a security risk of 0, and an obfuscated score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature. These seem reasonable given the content.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports and the code itself indicate no malicious activity, the risk scores should remain at 0. The code does not perform any network operations, handle untrusted input, or execute dynamic code.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified. No malicious intent or behavior is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as standard error class definitions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's content and purpose.\n\n**Final Assessment and Recommendations**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: Should remain at **0**.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: Should remain at **0**.  \n- **Risk Score**: Should remain at **0**, as there's no indication of security issues.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions used for error handling within the Gradio framework. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The reports correctly identify its purpose and safety.\n\n**My own estimate**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence presented.",
