  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to assess the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines multiple custom exception classes used within the Gradio framework.\n- It includes a user-facing Error class designed to display error modals with configurable messages.\n- No external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code is primarily for error handling, documentation, and user notifications.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, the code does not contain any security vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. It is a straightforward set of class definitions for error handling.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature. The obfuscated score is also 0, which aligns with the absence of obfuscation.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are 0, which is justified.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  The code does not perform any network activity, code injection, or malicious operations. The malware score of 0 across reports is correct.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on static analysis, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Anomalies or suspicious points?**  \n  None detected. The code is purely for exception class definitions, with documentation support.\n\n- **Potential hidden issues?**  \n  No hidden behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent is evident.\n\n- **Is there any obfuscation?**  \n  No, the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (since it's error handling code, minimal risk, but some might argue that any code that interacts with user interfaces could have some risk if misused, but given the static nature, 0 is appropriate)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the provided reports' assessments. The code is standard, safe, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores of 0 for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, primarily because it's error handling code)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the code is safe and purely for error management within the Gradio framework.",
