  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the potential security implications.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm presence of issues in the code**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for various exception types, including a user-facing Error class that displays modal dialogs.\n- No hardcoded credentials, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code does not perform any data processing, external calls, or contain any suspicious logic.\n\n**Step 2: Check for errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning**\n\n- All exception classes are straightforward and follow standard Python patterns.\n- The Error class is well-documented, with parameters for message, duration, visibility, title, and exception printing.\n- No logical flaws or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The use of an alias (`InvalidApiName = InvalidApiNameError`) for backward compatibility is standard practice.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned in reports**\n\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code content.\n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty that the analysis is correct.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since the code contains only class definitions for error handling and documentation, with no malicious behavior, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- No security risk, malware, or obfuscation is present.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate malware score**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- All reports correctly assume that the code is for defining exceptions and user error modals.\n- No assumptions about hidden vulnerabilities or malicious intent are warranted.\n\n**Step 7: Ensure consistency of scores**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature: no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard set of exception class definitions for the Gradio framework, with documentation support. It is intended solely for error handling and user notifications, with no malicious or security-compromising behavior.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- No changes needed; the current scoring and analysis are accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is benign, purpose-focused, and free from security risks or malicious intent. The detailed documentation and standard patterns reinforce its safety profile.",
