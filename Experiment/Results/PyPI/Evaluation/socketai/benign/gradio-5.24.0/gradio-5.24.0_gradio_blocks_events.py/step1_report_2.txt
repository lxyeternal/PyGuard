  "purpose": "Define and register event listeners for a Blocks component using a metaclass, dynamically adding event handlers.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules; class and method definitions; dynamic creation/modification functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leakage, code injection, or external communication; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization of event list → Dynamic creation of event listeners → Assignment to class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; use of dynamic metaclass and event handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a metaclass to dynamically assign event listener methods to a class, based on predefined event list. It calls create_or_modify_pyi, which is likely for type hinting or code generation, not malicious activity. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code is present. The approach is typical for event-driven architecture. No anomalies or malicious indicators are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for dynamic event registration within a Python UI framework, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
