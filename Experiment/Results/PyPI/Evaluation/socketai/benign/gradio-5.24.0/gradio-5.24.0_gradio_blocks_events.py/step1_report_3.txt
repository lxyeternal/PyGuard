{
  "purpose": "Define a metaclass for creating Blocks components with associated events and manage event triggers.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (gradio), class and variable definitions, iteration over BLOCKS_EVENTS",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or actions, such as network communication, file writing, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of event triggers and setting documentation through set_doc method; no external data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. The code primarily defines classes and manages event handlers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a metaclass (BlocksMeta) that dynamically attaches event listeners based on the BLOCKS_EVENTS list. It uses a standard pattern of copying event triggers, setting documentation, and creating a class with this behavior. The create_or_modify_pyi function appears to generate or modify type hints or interface files for the BlocksEvents class, which is empty but serves as a container for events. The overall logic is typical for event-driven component design, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard pattern for dynamic event handling within a component framework. No malicious intent or suspicious activity is detected. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger UI component system.",
