{
  "purpose": "The code defines a metaclass and a class for managing events in a Blocks component, dynamically creating event listeners and modifying type hints.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the list BLOCKS_EVENTS and the imported modules 'gradio.component_meta' and 'gradio.events'.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to the 'attrs' dictionary to set event listeners, and calls create_or_modify_pyi which modifies type hint files.",
  "flows": "BLOCKS_EVENTS is iterated to create event listener objects, which are then assigned to class attributes. The create_or_modify_pyi function modifies type info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or malicious logic present. Usage appears to be standard for event handling.",
  "analysis": "The code employs a metaclass to dynamically assign event listener methods based on a predefined list, then modifies type hint files accordingly. The logic appears straightforward and standard for dynamic class construction. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. No external data handling, network activity, or secret management is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of dynamic event assignment in a Python class with type hint modifications. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
