{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically registers event listeners for a GUI component class using a metaclass, and updates type hint files for the event class.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the BLOCKS_EVENTS list and the imported modules, particularly the create_or_modify_pyi function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows to potentially malicious effects; the code only manipulates class attributes and type hint files.",
  "flows": "The code creates event listener objects from BLOCKS_EVENTS and assigns them as class attributes, then updates type hint files via create_or_modify_pyi.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, network activity, or malicious code are present. The use of create_or_modify_pyi is standard for type hinting.",
  "analysis": "The code employs a standard pattern for dynamic event registration via a metaclass, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It imports known modules, defines a list of events, and assigns event listeners during class creation. The call to create_or_modify_pyi is a typical utility for type hint management. No evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious intent is observed. The code is clear, straightforward, and aligns with common practices in Python GUI frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of dynamic event handling using a metaclass, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
