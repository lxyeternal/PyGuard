{
  "purpose": "Define a metaclass 'BlocksMeta' that dynamically adds event listeners to a class and modifies a related type hints file.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'gradio' library, and the BLOCKS_EVENTS list which is used to generate event listeners.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; dynamic creation of event listeners could potentially be misused if inputs are manipulated externally, but there is no evidence of malicious data flow.",
  "flows": "BLOCKS_EVENTS list influences creation and copying of EventListener objects, which then set documentation and are assigned as attributes; no external input or untrusted data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically creates event listeners and modifies type information; however, these are standard patterns for event-driven design and do not appear malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules from the 'gradio' library, sets up a list of event identifiers, and defines a metaclass 'BlocksMeta' that, during class creation, adds event listener attributes by copying and setting documentation on EventListener instances. It also calls 'create_or_modify_pyi' to update type hints. The class 'BlocksEvents' is an empty container for these event attributes, populated dynamically by the metaclass. All operations appear consistent with event handling mechanisms, and no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, hidden network activity, or code injection are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of dynamic event assignment via a metaclass in an event-driven framework. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. The logic is straightforward and intended for event management.",
