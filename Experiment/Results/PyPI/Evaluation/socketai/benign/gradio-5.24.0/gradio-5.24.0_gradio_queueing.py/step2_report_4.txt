  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a task/event management system for a web framework, reading input data, session hashes, environment variables, and internal data structures.\n- **Sinks:** Error payloads, network communication via `wasm_utils.send_error`, and message broadcasting.\n- **Flow:** Data flows from input to queue, then through processing functions (`process_events`) that call external APIs, with responses/errors sent back to clients.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, well-structured, with no malicious intent. It manages server-side tasks, progress, and client notifications securely. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues found. The risk and malware scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, focusing on asynchronous request/event handling, reading data from `PredictBodyInternal`, environment variables, and session data.\n- **Sinks:** Message sending, API calls, error reporting.\n- **Flow:** Input to event queue, processing, responses/errors to clients.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. Slightly unusual batch handling but standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code functions as a legitimate event-driven server component. No malicious behavior. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No red flags.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Manages an async queue for API request handling, reading environment variables, request data, session hashes.\n- **Sinks:** Message passing, API calls, error handling.\n- **Flow:** Input → Queue → API processing → client responses.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard server-side queue management, no signs of malicious activity. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-reasoned; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, managing event queues, handling task scheduling, progress updates, client communication.\n- **Sinks:** Message passing, API calls.\n- **Flow:** Input requests → queue → processing → client updates.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate server-side code, no malicious indicators. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Handles async task queues for a web app, reading from requests, environment variables.\n- **Sinks:** Message broadcasting, API calls, error reporting.\n- **Flow:** Input data → queue → processing → client responses.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical event queue logic, no malicious activity. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-founded.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is a standard, legitimate implementation of an asynchronous event/task queue system for a web server framework. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n- **Security Risks:** Slightly varying but low scores (0.1–0.2), reflecting typical server-side code with no evident malicious intent.\n- **Scores Justification:** The scores are consistent with the analysis—no signs of malicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious network behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is clear, standard Python.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Minor risks due to environment variable reliance and potential misconfiguration, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Summary:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured server-side event queue system for asynchronous request processing. No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and consistent with the observed code behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**The overall assessment is that this code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation, and a very low security risk.**",
