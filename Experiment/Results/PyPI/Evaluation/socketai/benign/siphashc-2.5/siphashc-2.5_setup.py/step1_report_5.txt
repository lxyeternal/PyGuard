  "purpose": "Setup script for building and installing the 'siphashc' Python extension module from C sources.",
  "sources": "Reads 'siphashc.c' and 'siphash/siphash.c' source files for compilation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; primarily compiles C extension modules.",
  "flows": "Reads source files during build process; no data flows to other parts of code or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. No code execution, network activity, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define a C extension module named 'siphashc' with specified source files. The code appears standard for a Python C extension setup. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security issues. It strictly serves to compile and install the extension.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup script for compiling a C extension module. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
