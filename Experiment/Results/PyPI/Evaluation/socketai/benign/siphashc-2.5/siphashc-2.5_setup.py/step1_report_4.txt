  "purpose": "Setup script for building the siphashc Python extension module from C source files.",
  "sources": "The setup script reads no external or untrusted input; it specifies static file paths for compilation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the script only defines compilation parameters for a C extension module.",
  "flows": "N/A — the script does not process untrusted data or execute untrusted code; it merely defines build instructions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define a Python extension module called 'siphashc' with specified C source files. It is a standard setup configuration without any dynamic code execution, external input, or suspicious logic. No signs of malicious behavior or malware are present. The code is straightforward and typical for C extension module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for compiling a C extension module. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not contain obfuscation or malware.",
