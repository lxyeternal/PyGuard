  "purpose": "Setup configuration for building the 'siphashc' C extension module in Python.",
  "sources": "Static source files 'siphashc.c' and 'siphash/siphash.c' specified in the setup script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or network operations present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "N/A — the script only defines build parameters without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script defining a C extension module with fixed source files. It performs no dynamic behavior, input/output, or network activity. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's static, straightforward nature confirms it is a typical build configuration without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for a Python C extension module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports and scores are accurate and justified.",
