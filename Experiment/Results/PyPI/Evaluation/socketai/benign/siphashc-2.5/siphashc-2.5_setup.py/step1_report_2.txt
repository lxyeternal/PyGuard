  "purpose": "Setup script for compiling and installing the 'siphashc' C extension module.",
  "sources": "Reads static source files 'siphashc.c' and 'siphash/siphash.c' specified in the setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script solely handles static file inclusion for build process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup configuration with no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' modules to define a C extension module 'siphashc'. It specifies static source files for compilation. There are no input operations, data processing, or external communications. The code is a straightforward setup script with standard use of the setuptools library. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. It appears to be a normal build configuration for a Python C extension module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for compiling a C extension with no malicious intent or security concerns. It performs standard operations for package setup, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
