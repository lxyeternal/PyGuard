  "purpose": "Importing specific classes from a local module named 'layer' related to map services and layers.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.layer' in the current package directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or data leaks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks can be identified in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward import statement; no anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a standard import of specific classes from a local module. It does not include any executable logic, user input handling, or external communications. Given the limited context, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The import appears to be part of a larger application related to map or GIS functionalities. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this minimal code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard import statement for local classes. Without additional code or context, the code appears benign.",
