  "purpose": "Importing specific classes related to map service layers, features, tables, and raster layers from a local module named 'layer'.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module file 'layer'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; this is a straightforward import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only static import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a local module, indicating structured code organization. No external data, user input, or network activity is involved. The imported classes pertain to map layers, which are typical in geospatial applications. No malicious behavior or suspicious code patterns are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
