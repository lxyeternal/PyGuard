  "sources": "The import statement reads the module 'layer' located in the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are evident in this line.",
  "flows": "This line does not establish data flows; it merely imports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in this import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code imports four classes from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity at this point. It appears to be a standard import statement. Since no further code is provided, no additional analysis of flows or anomalies is possible. Import statements are typical and do not in themselves suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard import statement importing classes from a local module. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation in this line.",
