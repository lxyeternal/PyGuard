  "purpose": "Import classes related to map layers and GIS functionalities from a local module named 'layer'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which reads the 'layer' module in the current package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only imports classes without processing data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process data or execute logic beyond importing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with standard syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import of specific classes from a local module. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The import statement is syntactically correct and typical for modular Python projects. No data flows, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, reflecting the benign nature. Confidence is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code, with a score of 1. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No further action is necessary.",
