{
  "purpose": "To provide imports and metadata for various GIS data visualization and analysis components in the arcgis.layers module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules (_types, _scenelyrs, _msl) and the __all__ list defining exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no network, file, or environment interaction observed.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow, processing, or data manipulation present in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or hardcoded secrets. The code is straightforward and purely structural, involving imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules and the declaration of the __all__ list. There are no function definitions, data processing, network operations, or any behavior that could indicate malicious activity. The code appears to be part of a package's module initialization, exposing specific classes for external use. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard import and export structure for the arcgis.layers package. It contains no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is purely structural, serving as an interface for other parts of the library.",
