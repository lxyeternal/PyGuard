{
  "purpose": "This module provides import statements for various GIS layer classes and manages their exports for a larger GIS application or library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_types, _scenelyrs, _msl) and the module's own __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "No user input, network operations, or data outputs are directly present in this code. It only imports and exports classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks. The code solely defines module-level imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes from internal submodules and defines the __all__ list for public API exposure. There are no data inputs, outputs, or code execution pathways. It does not perform any operations, network communication, or data processing that could pose security concerns. Its structure is standard for a Python package's module defining exports.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard module for organizing and exposing classes related to GIS layers. It contains no malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It functions solely as an interface for other parts of the application.",
