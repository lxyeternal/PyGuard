{
  "purpose": "This module provides imports and definitions for various GIS visualization layers within the ArcGIS library, facilitating mapping and spatial data analysis.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from internal module imports (_types, _scenelyrs, _msl) within the arcgis.layers package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data outputs; the code only imports classes and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks exists; the code only manages module imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward module import and export statements with no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a list defining public exports (__all__). There are no user inputs, network interactions, or data processing operations. The imports are from internal modules, likely part of a GIS SDK, and do not contain embedded code that could be malicious. The module's purpose is to organize and expose GIS layer classes for external use. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module to re-export GIS layer classes. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks.",
