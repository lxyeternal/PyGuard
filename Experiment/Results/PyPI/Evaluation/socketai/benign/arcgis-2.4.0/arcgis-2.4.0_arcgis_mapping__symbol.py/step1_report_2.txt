{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for generating map symbols and displaying colormaps, primarily for visual styling in GIS applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as geometry_type, symbol_type, colors, and various style options; also reads from imported modules and lists (e.g., ALLOWED_CMAPS, LINE_STYLES).",
  "sinks": "The code constructs and returns dictionaries representing symbol configurations; no direct data sinks or external data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through functions, influencing the creation of symbol dictionaries, and colormap displays are generated via matplotlib. No external network or data exfiltration is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior such as obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or hardcoded secrets; the code is consistent with standard GIS symbol generation. The use of random color selection and parameter defaulting appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs parameter validation, color mapping, and symbol dictionary construction based on standard GIS styling conventions. It uses external libraries like matplotlib for visualization, with no indication of malicious activity. All data manipulations are internal and related to styling options. There are no network calls, data leaks, or obfuscated techniques. The use of random seed generation and parameter defaults is typical for such visual styling functions. The code does not include any code injection, backdoors, or suspicious external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation for GIS symbol and colormap handling with no signs of malicious behavior. It securely constructs symbol configurations and visualizes colormaps without external data transmission or harmful operations.",
