{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for generating GIS symbols and visual colormaps, primarily for styling and visualization purposes within GIS applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters for symbol and colormap creation, including geometry type, style options, colors, and visualization parameters. No external data sources or untrusted input streams are involved.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs symbol configuration dictionaries used for rendering GIS features. There are no external data leaks, network calls, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the create_symbol function, which processes and transforms them into symbol dictionaries. These dictionaries are then used by GIS rendering engines; no external data transfer occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in the parameter name 'font_familty' (should be 'font_family') within the font dictionary. Use of np.random.randint for color steps introduces non-determinism but is benign. No obfuscated or malicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for generating GIS symbols and colormaps, relying on standard libraries (numpy, matplotlib). It performs data validation, style mapping, and configuration generation without external data fetching or code obfuscation. The use of random functions for color steps is for aesthetic variation and does not pose security risks. No network activity, file I/O, or dynamic code execution is detected. The minor typo does not impact security but should be corrected for correctness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured GIS utility module for symbol and colormap creation. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising features. The scores assigned in the reports—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.1—are justified and appropriate.",
