{
  "purpose": "The script manages installation and uninstallation of Jupyter Notebook extensions related to ArcGIS widgets, providing command-line options for user installation, symlinking, and removal.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse; imports from notebook.nbextensions; outputs to standard output.",
  "targets": "Potentially uninstalls nbextensions based on user input; no direct data leaks or external data manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are parsed and control flow directs to install or uninstall functions; uninstall function calls external module methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The try-except block suppresses exceptions but only for uninstall process; no malicious obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with clear control flow based on user arguments. It imports standard and specific Jupyter notebook extension modules only during uninstall. The uninstall function calls external functions to remove extensions; no code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are evident. The script does not perform any network communication, data collection, or other suspicious activities. The try-except block is broad but only catches import or uninstall errors, which is typical for cleanup scripts. No obfuscation or malware signatures detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and intended solely for managing Jupyter extension installations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
