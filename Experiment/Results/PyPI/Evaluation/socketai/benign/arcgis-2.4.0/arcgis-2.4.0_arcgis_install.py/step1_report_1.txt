  "purpose": "This script manages the installation and uninstallation of ArcGIS IPython widgets/extensions for Jupyter Notebook.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments; imports from standard libraries and the notebook package.",
  "sinks": "Calls to uninstall_nbextension potentially executing external code, print statements for user notifications.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument parsing (source) to install/uninstall functions (sink). No external data or network interactions detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code performs straightforward install/uninstall operations.",
  "analysis": "The script is a utility to manage Jupyter Notebook extensions for a specific widget. It includes standard command-line parsing, conditional execution of install or uninstall routines, and exception handling during uninstallation. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious system modifications are evident. The uninstall function calls a notebook package method to remove extensions, which is typical for such scripts. There are no hidden or suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or external data transmissions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility script for extension management with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical operations with proper exception handling. No malware indicators or security threats detected.",
