{
  "purpose": "The script manages installation and uninstallation of ArcGIS IPython widgets, primarily for Jupyter Notebook extensions.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments; import statements for 'notebook.nbextensions'.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'uninstall_nbextension' function which may modify Jupyter Notebook extensions; printing status messages.",
  "flows": "User inputs trigger install or uninstall functions; 'uninstall' calls 'uninstall_nbextension' potentially modifying extensions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. No use of dangerous system calls or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, providing CLI options to install or uninstall Jupyter extensions related to ArcGIS. It imports and calls functions from a legitimate Jupyter Notebook extension management module. The uninstall function handles exceptions and provides manual instructions if automatic removal fails. No suspicious or malicious activities such as network communication, data theft, or code injection are evident. The code does not perform any unsafe operations or contain obfuscated segments.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a benign utility for managing Jupyter Notebook extensions related to ArcGIS. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It primarily interfaces with existing Jupyter extension management functions and provides user guidance. Overall, it is safe based on the provided code.",
