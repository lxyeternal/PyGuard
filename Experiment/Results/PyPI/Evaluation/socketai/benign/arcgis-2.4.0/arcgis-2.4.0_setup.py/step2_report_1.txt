  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no suspicious or malicious code. The subprocess call is for a known workaround, and the overall code is standard setup script behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score reflects the benign nature of the code, and the malware score correctly indicates no malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the subprocess call for SSL certificates on Mac OS being standard. No malicious behavior is identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The post-install step is a common workaround, not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The evaluation is consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Focuses on the execution of system commands during post-install, especially the 'Install Certificates.command' script on Mac OS. Recognizes that this is a legitimate workaround.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — suitable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent detected; the code executes known, safe commands.\n\n**Conclusion:** The analysis aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Notes the use of subprocess to run scripts on macOS, with no signs of malicious activity. The broad exception handling is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — slightly higher but still low.\n- **Justification:** The slight increase in risk score accounts for the execution of external scripts, but overall, it's benign.\n\n**Conclusion:** The evaluation is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The most confident assessment, stating the code is standard setup with no malicious activity, and the subprocess calls are legitimate for known workarounds.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — fully reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's conclusion is well-founded.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Consistently 0, as no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the routine nature of the setup script and post-install routines.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** ~0.1 — minimal risk, primarily due to execution of system scripts during post-install, which is standard practice.\n\n**In conclusion, the code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent or security issues.**",
