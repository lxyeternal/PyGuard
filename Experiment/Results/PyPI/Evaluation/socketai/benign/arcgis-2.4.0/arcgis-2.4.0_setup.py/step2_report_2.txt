  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup.py with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The subprocess call for the OpenSSL workaround is well-documented and benign.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The subprocess call is for a known workaround, not malicious. The overall structure is typical for setup scripts.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears accurate. The low risk score (0.1) is justified given the benign nature of the subprocess call and standard setup code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the subprocess call for certificates on macOS is a standard workaround. No suspicious code or malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The subprocess call is a known, legitimate workaround. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the SSL certificate setup on macOS, which involves executing an external script via subprocess. No signs of malicious activity, just standard setup behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The subprocess call is a routine operation for SSL certificate setup on macOS. No suspicious code or malicious intent.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's evaluation is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, noting that subprocess calls during post-install are for SSL certificate setup, with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) but still justified, as executing system scripts can be a vector if misused. However, in this context, it's a known workaround.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard setup.py with post-install routines for SSL certificates on macOS, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The subprocess call is for a known, legitimate purpose. No obfuscation or malware.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The evaluation is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malware (0). The subprocess calls are for known, legitimate system workarounds.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is consistent; no obfuscated code is present.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1–0.2), justified by the use of subprocess for system scripts, which is standard in setup routines.\n\n- **Confidence levels:** High (0.9–1), reflecting thorough understanding.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware:** 0 across all reports — no signs of malicious code.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n\n**Risk:** Given the subprocess calls are for legitimate system workarounds, I would set the overall risk score at **0.1** — very low.\n\n**Obfuscation:** 0, as confirmed.\n\n**Malware:** 0, as confirmed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is standard setup logic with no malicious intent.\n- The subprocess calls are for known, legitimate system configuration steps.\n- No obfuscation or malware detected.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the code's behavior.",
