  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no malicious or suspicious code. The subprocess call is for a known workaround, and no obfuscation or backdoors are present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is standard setup code, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of subprocess calls for SSL certificates on macOS. No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the subprocess execution is for SSL certificate setup, a legitimate process. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard setup script, benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Focuses on the same subprocess call during post-install for SSL certificates, which is a common workaround.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar findings; the subprocess call is for a known SSL workaround, with no obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, benign setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports agree that the code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** Very low, primarily related to execution of system commands during post-install, which are known and documented workarounds.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The subprocess calls for running 'Install Certificates.command' on macOS are standard and well-documented procedures to ensure SSL security. They are not malicious.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or network activity indicative of malware.\n- The code structure is straightforward, with exception handling that is broad but not suspicious.\n- Dependency and package data management follow typical patterns.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to execution of system commands during post-install, which is a known, legitimate workaround.\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, standard, and free of security threats.**",
