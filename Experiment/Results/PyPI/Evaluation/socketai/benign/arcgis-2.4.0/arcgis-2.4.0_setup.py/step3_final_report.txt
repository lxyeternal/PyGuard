{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the 'arcgis' Python package, managing dependencies, package data, and post-install routines, including system-specific workarounds.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, system files, and executes subprocess commands during post-install (notably on macOS).",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing system scripts (e.g., 'Install Certificates.command') during post-installation.",
  "flows": "Sources include environment and system files; flows lead to subprocess execution for system configuration tasks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The subprocess calls are for known, legitimate workarounds.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: dependency management, package data inclusion, and post-install routines. The subprocess calls are for SSL certificate setup on macOS, a documented and benign process. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The exception handling is broad but typical. Overall, the code is straightforward and aligns with best practices for setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The subprocess executions are legitimate system workarounds, and no suspicious or obfuscated code is present.",
