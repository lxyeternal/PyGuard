{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes from a local module named '_lyrs'.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the '_lyrs' module, which likely loads code from local files or package components.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present; no external data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; this is purely import statements with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward import statements with no unusual syntax, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. No signs of malicious behavior or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple import statements from a local module '_lyrs'. There are no dynamic imports, no input handling, and no suspicious code constructs. The imported classes pertain to 3D layers, which appear to be part of a spatial or graphical library. The structure is standard and does not raise security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign import statement snippet, with no indications of malicious activity or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger application, importing necessary classes for 3D layer handling.",
