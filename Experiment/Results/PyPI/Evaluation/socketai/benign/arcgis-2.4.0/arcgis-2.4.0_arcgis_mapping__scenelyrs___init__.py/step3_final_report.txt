  "purpose": "Import statements for various 3D layer classes from a local module '_lyrs'.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from the local module '_lyrs'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely static imports.",
  "flows": "N/A - static imports without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements importing classes related to 3D layers from a local module '_lyrs'. There is no dynamic code execution, input handling, external communication, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and typical for organizing package components. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or malicious behavior are present or implied. The code does not contain secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
