  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is solely composed of static import statements from a local module `_lyrs`.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data processing, or external communication.\n   - The code appears benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is straightforward import statements.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - The reasoning is sound: static imports from a local module do not pose security risks or malware concerns.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree on zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk, raising these scores would be unjustified.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious activity.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is consistent with the code's benign description.\n   - No malicious behavior is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on observable static import statements with no hidden or suspicious behavior.\n   - No assumptions are made that could lead to false positives.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n   - The confidence level is 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard set of import statements for a module related to 3D visualization or GIS.\n- There are no security concerns, malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**My Own Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and comprehensive; no further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.",
