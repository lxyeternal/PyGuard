{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes and functions from a local module named '_lyrs'. The purpose is likely to expose or organize these components for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module '_lyrs' to import specific classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or potential points for data leakage or execution of untrusted code within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the '_lyrs' module to the current module through import statements, with no further data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns observed in these import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and consists of multiple import statements from a relative module '_lyrs'. It imports various classes related to 3D layers and scene management, which seem to be part of a larger project. No external input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior are present. The structure and content are typical for organizing package components.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of import statements used to bring in classes from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in these imports. The code appears to serve its purpose without security concerns.",
