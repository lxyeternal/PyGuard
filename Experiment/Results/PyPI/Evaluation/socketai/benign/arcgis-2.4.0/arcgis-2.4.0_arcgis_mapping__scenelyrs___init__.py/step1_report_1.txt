{
  "purpose": "The code imports various classes related to 3D layers from a local module '_lyrs', likely for use in a larger 3D visualization or GIS application.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing classes from the local module '_lyrs'",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external outputs are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; these are straightforward imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed; the code is simply importing classes",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple classes from a local module named '_lyrs'. All operations are static imports without dynamic code execution, input handling, or external communication. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The structure is typical for organizing code in a package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard import operations for a 3D visualization module. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
