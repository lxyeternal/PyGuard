{
  "purpose": "This code imports various classes related to 3D and scene layering from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module named '_lyrs' within the same package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input data; the code only imports classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; only static imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements with no unusual syntax, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing multiple classes from a local module, likely for use elsewhere in the package. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. There are no indicators of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The structure is clean, and the imports do not suggest any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module import statement for 3D and scene layer classes. No malicious or security risks are identified.",
