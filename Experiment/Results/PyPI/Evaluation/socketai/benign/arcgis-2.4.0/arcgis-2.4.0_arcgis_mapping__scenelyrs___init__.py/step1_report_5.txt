{
  "purpose": "This code imports various classes from a local module '_lyrs' related to 3D and scene layers, likely for a visualization or GIS library.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from a local module '_lyrs'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only class imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior detected. The code consists solely of import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports several classes from a local module, which is standard in modular Python projects. No code execution, data processing, or network activity is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The absence of function definitions, data handling, or external calls indicates no immediate security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of straightforward import statements from a local module, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be part of a larger, benign application related to 3D or scene visualization.",
