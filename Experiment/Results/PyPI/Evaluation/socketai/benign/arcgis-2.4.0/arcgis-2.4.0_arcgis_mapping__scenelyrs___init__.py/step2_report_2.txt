  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is a set of static import statements from a local module `_lyrs`.\n   - All reports agree that these are straightforward imports with no dynamic code, input handling, or external communication.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or hidden functionality.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying that the code is benign.\n   - They do not overstate security concerns; all conclude that the code is standard and safe.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Any High Risk Scores (>0.5):**\n   - All scores are zero, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n   - No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious operations or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They recognize the code's simplicity and benign intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable ratings are present.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**My Reasoned Estimate:**\n\nGiven the nature of the code and the reviews, I concur with the provided scores. The code is purely import statements with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is benign.\n- No security risks are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll evidence points to this code being safe, with no indication of malware, obfuscation, or security concerns.",
