{
  "purpose": "Define and initialize various environment settings and shared data for ArcGIS geoprocessing tools and modules.",
  "sources": "None (All variables are initialized with None or default values, no external input read).",
  "sinks": "None (No untrusted data flows or external output operations detected).",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted data from sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "All variables are simple data containers with default or None values; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively contains variable declarations and documentation comments setting up environmental parameters for ArcGIS tools. No code execution, input reading, or data transmission occurs. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated logic is present. The absence of external data input, network operations, or secret handling indicates a benign purpose. The code appears to be a standard configuration module defining environment variables with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign configuration setup for environment parameters within ArcGIS tools. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It solely defines variables with no active logic, data flow, or external communication.",
