  "purpose": "Configuration setup for ArcGIS environment variables and settings.",
  "sources": "Variable declarations and documentation comments within the module.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static variable assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and documentation-heavy.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable declarations with default values and detailed documentation comments. There is no active logic, data processing, external communication, or code execution. All variables are initialized with None or default boolean values, serving as configuration parameters for ArcGIS tools. No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident. The code is static and purely declarative, indicating a benign setup module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe configuration module for ArcGIS environment variables with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals point to benign, static configuration data.",
