{
  "purpose": "Define a class for interfacing with LTC2387 family devices, including device selection and sampling rate configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads device information from self._ctx.devices, environment setup via context_manager, and user-supplied sampling frequency values.",
  "sinks": "The sampling_frequency setter writes values to device attributes via _set_iio_dev_attr_str, potentially affecting device behavior if manipulated maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input from user or external configuration flows into sampling_frequency setter, which updates device attributes potentially controlling device sampling rate.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments. The code appears to use standard library functions and patterns for device interfacing.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes device classes, filters for compatible device names, and allows setting and getting the sampling frequency via device attributes. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Usage of device attributes and device list iteration is typical for hardware control libraries. No unusual behavior or malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard hardware interface class with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It enables device selection and configuration through safe API calls. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious data flows identified.",
