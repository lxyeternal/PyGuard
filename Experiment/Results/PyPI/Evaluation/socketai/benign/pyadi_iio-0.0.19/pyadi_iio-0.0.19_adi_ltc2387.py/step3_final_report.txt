{
  "purpose": "This code defines a hardware interface class for LTC2387 family ADC devices, managing device enumeration, selection, and configuration via device attributes.",
  "sources": "Device enumeration in self._ctx.devices, device name matching, and attribute access via _get_iio_dev_attr and _set_iio_dev_attr_str.",
  "sinks": "Interaction with device attributes (sampling_frequency) which could be manipulated, but these are standard hardware controls.",
  "flows": "Device enumeration → device selection based on name → attribute read/write for sampling_frequency.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or network activity; straightforward device management logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard hardware interface class that enumerates devices, selects the appropriate device based on name, and provides property methods for configuration. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The device attribute interactions are typical for hardware control. The code relies on external trusted modules. No external inputs or network communications are involved. The overall structure and logic are clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard device driver wrapper for LTC2387 ADCs with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), which is appropriate given its function.",
