{
  "purpose": "Define a class for the adaq8092 device, a data acquisition solution, including initialization and property for sampling frequency.",
  "sources": "Reads device configuration and channel information during initialization and sampling frequency attribute access.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No untrusted data output or insecure data handling present.",
  "flows": "Initialization reads device info from the context; sampling_frequency property retrieves device attribute data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns. No external network activity or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes device interfaces, identifies device types, and exposes a property to get sampling frequency. It imports standard libraries, uses class inheritance, and accesses device attributes. No external data leaks, no malicious logic, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a straightforward device driver component without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard device class implementation for hardware data acquisition with no malicious or suspicious features detected. It functions to interface with hardware and retrieve configuration data safely.",
