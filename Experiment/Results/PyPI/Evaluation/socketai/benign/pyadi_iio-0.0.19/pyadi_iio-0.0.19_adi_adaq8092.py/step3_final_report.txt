  "purpose": "Hardware interface for the ADAQ8092 device, enabling device discovery, configuration, and attribute access.",
  "sources": "Device discovery via self._ctx.find_device; device channels list; attribute access through _get_iio_dev_attr.",
  "sinks": "Retrieval of 'sampling_frequency' attribute; no untrusted data sinks or external data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Device discovery → device attribute access → property retrieval; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code; standard device interaction patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for hardware device interfacing, performing device discovery and attribute access. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or network activity. The fallback device discovery is typical. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the straightforward, benign nature of the code. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The code is safe and standard for hardware drivers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard hardware interface module with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
