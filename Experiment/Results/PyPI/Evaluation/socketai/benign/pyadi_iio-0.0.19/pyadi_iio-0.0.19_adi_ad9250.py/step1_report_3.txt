  "purpose": "Define a class for interfacing with the AD9250 high-speed ADC device, including configuration and status retrieval.",
  "sources": "URI parameter in __init__, device name, username, password, and device attribute accesses (test_mode getter/setter).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (uri, username, password) flow into object initialization; test_mode setter reads/writes IIO attributes; jesd204_statuses property retrieves device statuses.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded default credentials ('root', 'analog'); use of potentially sensitive info in code. No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a device class for AD9250 with standard Python class structure, inheriting multiple modules for device management. It uses hardcoded credentials, which is a security concern but not malicious per se. The methods access device attributes and statuses, typical for device control software. No network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. No suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard device interface implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The main concern is hardcoded credentials, which pose a security risk but do not indicate malicious intent.",
