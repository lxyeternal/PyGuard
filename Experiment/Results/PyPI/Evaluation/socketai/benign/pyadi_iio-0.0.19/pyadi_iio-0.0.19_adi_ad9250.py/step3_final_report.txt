  "purpose": "Device driver class for the AD9250 high-speed ADC, managing device initialization, configuration, and status retrieval.",
  "sources": "Reads default credentials ('root', 'analog') during initialization; accesses device attributes and statuses.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration points present.",
  "flows": "Initialization uses default credentials; property getters/setters interact with device attributes; status retrieval from JESD interface.",
  "anomalies": "Uses default credentials ('root', 'analog'), which is a security concern but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward device interface class importing standard modules, with no obfuscated or malicious code. Default credentials are a security concern if exposed but do not constitute malicious activity. No network activity, data leaks, or backdoors are present. The code's structure and behavior align with typical hardware driver implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning as a device driver with no malicious intent. The only security concern is the default credentials, which should be changed in deployment environments. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
