  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate hardware control software for DDS signal generators, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's purpose."
