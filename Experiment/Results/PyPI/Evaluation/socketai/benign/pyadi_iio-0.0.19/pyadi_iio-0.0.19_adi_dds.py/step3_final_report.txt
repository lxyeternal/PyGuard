  "purpose": "Control and configure DDS signal generator channels by setting frequencies, phases, scales, and enabling/disabling outputs through hardware attribute manipulation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for frequency, scale, phase, and enable states; hardware attribute read/write interfaces via channel attributes.",
  "sinks": "Hardware device channels' attribute values (frequency, phase, scale, raw enable states).",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> attribute writes to hardware channels; hardware channel attribute reads -> data returned to caller.",
  "anomalies": "Inconsistent exception handling for negative frequencies (some raise exceptions without 'raise', others just instantiate Exception). Redundant manual increment of 'indx' within 'for' loops. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard hardware control class for DDS signal generators, manipulating device attributes for frequency, phase, scale, and enable states. It handles multiple channels and complex data formats with conditional logic for split cores. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. Input validation is minimal but typical; exception handling for invalid inputs is inconsistent but not malicious. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the control nature and lack of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate hardware control software for DDS signal generators, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
