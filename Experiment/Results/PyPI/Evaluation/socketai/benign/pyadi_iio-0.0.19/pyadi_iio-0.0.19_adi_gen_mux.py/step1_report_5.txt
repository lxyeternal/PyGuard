  "purpose": "Define a class to control a GEN-MUX device via IIO attributes, allowing selection of MUX options.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'uri' for context connection; 'device_name' parameter; property 'select' setter input.",
  "sinks": "Setter method 'select' which sets the 'mux_select' attribute, potentially influencing hardware configuration.",
  "flows": "Input 'select' value flows from the property setter to the '_set_iio_dev_attr_str' method, affecting '_ctrl' device attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Code appears standard for device control. No unusual dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing a GEN-MUX device using IIO attributes. It initializes with a URI and device name, finds the device, and raises an exception if not found. It provides properties to get available MUX options and to get/set the current MUX selection. The setter updates the device attribute via '_set_iio_dev_attr_str'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration. The code primarily manages hardware device attributes through a well-structured class, with no suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard device control class for a hardware MUX device, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
