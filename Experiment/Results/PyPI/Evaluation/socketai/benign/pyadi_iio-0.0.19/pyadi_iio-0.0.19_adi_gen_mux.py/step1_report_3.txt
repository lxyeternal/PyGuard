{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for controlling a GEN-MUX device via IIO attributes, allowing selection and querying of MUX options.",
  "sources": "Constructor reads device info via self._ctx.find_device; property methods access device attributes 'mux_select_available' and 'mux_select'; setter method sets device attribute 'mux_select'.",
  "sinks": "The setter method '_set_iio_dev_attr_str' potentially writes untrusted input 'value' to device attribute; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Constructor initializes device context; 'select_available' reads available options; 'select' getter reads current selection; 'select' setter writes the provided value to device attribute.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code. Use of standard IIO device attributes appears normal; no suspicious logic or anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard classes and defines a device control class for a hardware MUX device. The constructor finds a device via context manager, raising an exception if not found. Property methods retrieve and set device attributes related to MUX selection, using standard attribute access methods. No input validation or sanitization is evident for the 'select' setter, but given this is a device control interface, typical behavior involves passing trusted commands. The code does not include any network communication, data exfiltration, or suspicious logic. It appears to be standard hardware control code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate device interface for a GEN-MUX device, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It operates solely within hardware control boundaries and does not perform any suspicious actions. Overall security risk is minimal.",
