{
  "purpose": "This code provides custom Django template tags for retrieving static and media URL prefixes and static file paths, facilitating dynamic asset URL management in templates.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from Django settings (STATIC_URL, MEDIA_URL), template tag tokens, and context variables. It also processes static file paths passed as template arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs URLs or prefixes to the template context or directly into rendered templates, using safe methods like conditional_escape. It does not directly write to files or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Input from template tag arguments and Django settings flows into URL construction methods, which resolve paths and generate URLs. These URLs are then rendered into templates with optional escaping.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. No unsafe code execution or network activity is evident. The code mainly handles safe URL generation and path resolution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines template tags to generate static and media URLs, using Django's staticfiles storage or settings. It employs standard Django practices for path resolution and escaping. No obfuscated or malicious code segments are detected. The code does not handle user input beyond template arguments, and it uses Django's safe URL handling functions. The logic appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom Django template tags for static and media URL handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks within this code segment. It securely constructs and outputs URLs based on Django settings and provided paths.",
