{
  "purpose": "This code provides custom Django template tags and nodes for retrieving static and media URLs, and prefixes from settings for use in templates.",
  "sources": "Settings values (STATIC_URL, MEDIA_URL), template tags and variables, URL paths, and potentially user-supplied arguments via template tags.",
  "sinks": "URL join and escaping functions, static file storage system, assignment to template context variables.",
  "flows": "Input arguments from template tags -> handled via handle_token methods -> processed with handle_simple methods -> URL generation and assignment to context variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious external connections are present. The code relies on standard Django functions and settings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom Django template tags for retrieving static and media URL prefixes and static asset URLs, with proper validation and parsing. It uses standard Django functions and storage systems, avoiding direct file or system manipulation, and does not include any network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The logic appears to be straightforward and consistent with typical Django static/media handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom Django template tags for static and media URL retrieval, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It performs URL resolution and safe string handling without exposing sensitive data or executing unsafe operations.",
