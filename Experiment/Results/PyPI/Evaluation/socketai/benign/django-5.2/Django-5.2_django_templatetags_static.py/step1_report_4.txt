{
  "purpose": "This code provides custom Django template tags and nodes for retrieving static and media URLs, and prefixes from settings, used for rendering static/media assets in templates.",
  "sources": "Settings access via 'getattr(settings, name, \"\")' in handle_simple methods; template tags parsing token inputs and resolving paths; 'apps.is_installed' check; 'parser.compile_filter' for dynamic paths.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes to external systems or executes untrusted code directly; potential data flows involve resolving paths and URLs within Django's context.",
  "flows": "Token parsing -> path resolution -> URL generation. No untrusted external data flows outside typical Django URL and path handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'iri_to_uri' on settings values could potentially encode malicious or malformed URLs, but no hardcoded secrets or suspicious manipulations are present. Handling of paths is standard. No indication of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code implements template tags for static/media URL retrieval and prefix setting based on Django settings. It uses standard Django mechanisms, with proper error handling and no dynamic execution of untrusted code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The path handling relies on Django's staticfiles storage or URL joining, which is safe. There are no signs of data leakage, external data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. Overall, this code appears to be a typical, safe Django template utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides safe, standard functionality for static/media URL handling in Django templates. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It is a well-structured, conventional implementation with no security risks detected.",
