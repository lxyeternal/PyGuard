{
  "purpose": "Provides Django template tags for retrieving static and media URL prefixes and static asset URLs, facilitating dynamic URL resolution within templates.",
  "sources": "Template tag arguments, Django settings (STATIC_URL, MEDIA_URL), staticfiles storage, and template context variables.",
  "sinks": "URL resolution functions (iri_to_uri, urljoin, staticfiles_storage.url), assignment to template context variables.",
  "flows": "Template tags parse arguments -> resolve URLs via Django APIs -> assign URLs to context variables or return directly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no external network activity, standard use of Django APIs. Slight reliance on template variables could be misused if user-controlled, but within the scope, no actual vulnerability.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Django template tags for static/media URL handling, utilizing safe APIs like iri_to_uri and staticfiles_storage. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious external activity is present. The use of dynamic URL construction from settings and template variables is typical and safe, provided inputs are controlled. The security risk scores of 0 or 0.2 are justified; the minimal risk accounts for potential misuse if untrusted data influences URL paths, but the code itself remains secure. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is very low.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of Django static/media URL tags with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The slight security risk score reflects the potential for misuse if inputs are not sanitized at a higher level, but within this code, no vulnerabilities are evident.",
