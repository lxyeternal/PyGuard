{
  "purpose": "Defines custom Django template filters and tags for localizing and unlocalizing values within templates.",
  "sources": "Input comes from template tags and filter arguments, such as 'localize' and 'unlocalize'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially insecure rendering via 'formats.localize' with untrusted input, but no direct sinks for external data or network activity are present.",
  "flows": "Template inputs flow into 'localize'/'unlocalize' functions and 'localize_tag', which then call 'formats.localize' or modify context settings during rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. Usage of Django's format functions is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom template filters and a tag for localizing content within Django templates. The functions wrap around 'formats.localize' to render values localized or not, based on context or tag parameters. The 'localize_tag' allows enabling or disabling localization dynamically, which is a standard pattern. No network operations, data exfiltration, or code execution features are present. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom Django template tags and filters for localization control, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
