{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom Django template filters and tags for localizing or unlocalizing values within templates, and manages the localization state.",
  "sources": "The code reads template tags and filter inputs; specifically, the 'localize' and 'unlocalize' filters and the 'localize' tag with its arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the rendering of values through 'formats.localize' and the 'render' method of 'LocalizeNode', which outputs processed template content.",
  "flows": "Input data (template variables and tag arguments) flows through filters or tag parsing, affecting the 'use_l10n' setting in the context, which then influences output during rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The functions and class methods perform straightforward localization toggling and rendering. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements Django template tags and filters to control localization behavior. It utilizes standard Django 'formats.localize' for localization, with clear and conventional logic. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or security misuses. The logic is confined to template processing, with no external system interactions or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of localization controls for Django templates. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is well-structured, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
