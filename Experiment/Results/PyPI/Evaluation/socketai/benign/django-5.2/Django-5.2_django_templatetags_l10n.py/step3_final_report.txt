{
  "purpose": "Provides Django template filters and tags to control localization rendering, toggling between localized and non-localized formats.",
  "sources": "Input values passed to 'localize' and 'unlocalize' filters; 'localize' tag parameters and enclosed nodelist.",
  "sinks": "The 'formats.localize' function processes input data; context.use_l10n is temporarily modified during tag rendering.",
  "flows": "Input values flow into 'formats.localize' for localization; the 'localize' tag modifies 'context.use_l10n' during rendering of its nodelist.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. No external network calls or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Django localization filters and a tag, utilizing Django's 'formats.localize' and context variables. No malicious patterns, external calls, or obfuscation are present. The 'localize' filter and tag toggle localization settings, which is a common pattern. Minor concern exists regarding potential untrusted input being formatted, but Django's localization functions are designed to handle data safely. The security risk score of 0.2 in one report reflects this cautious stance, but overall, the code is benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of localization utilities in Django templates. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The minor security concern regarding untrusted input formatting is conservative and does not indicate a vulnerability. The overall security posture is very low risk.",
