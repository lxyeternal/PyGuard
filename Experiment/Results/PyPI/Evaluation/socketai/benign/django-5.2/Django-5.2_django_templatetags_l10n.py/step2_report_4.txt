  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code, the described behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of Django template filters and tags for localization, wrapping around Django's `formats.localize`.\n- No external system calls, network activity, or code obfuscation are present.\n- The logic is standard, with proper handling of context variables and tag parsing.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is standard, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0\n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, confirms no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, mentions a SecurityRisk of 0.2.  \n- **Justification:** The only potential concern is the use of `formats.localize()` with untrusted input, but this is standard for localization and doesn't inherently pose a security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2\n- **Verdict:** Slightly conservative but acceptable, as the code could be misused if user input is not sanitized elsewhere. Still, within the scope of localization functions, this is not a real vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Confirms no malicious behavior, straightforward localization toggling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Most reports assign 0, with one giving 0.2 for potential misuse of localization with untrusted data. Given the code's simplicity and standard nature, a risk score of 0.2 is somewhat cautious but acceptable.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no evident vulnerabilities or attack vectors.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, benign implementation of localization controls within Django templates. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behavior is present.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score |\n|---------|--------------|------------|\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0**     |\n\nThis reflects the benign and standard nature of the code, aligning with all provided reports.",
