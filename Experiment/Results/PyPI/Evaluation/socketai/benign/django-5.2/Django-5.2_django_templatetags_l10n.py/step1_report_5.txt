{
  "purpose": "The code provides custom Django template filters and tags for localizing values within templates, allowing dynamic control over localization settings.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from template variables (e.g., {{ 3.1415 }}) and template tags (e.g., {% localize off %}).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include rendering localized or non-localized values via formats.localize() and template rendering via nodelist.render().",
  "flows": "Template variables and tag arguments flow into formatting functions and template rendering; no untrusted data is processed in an unsafe manner.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or system commands. The code primarily manipulates localization settings within templates.",
  "analysis": "The code defines template filters 'localize' and 'unlocalize' that invoke 'formats.localize()' with controlled parameters, and a template tag 'localize' that toggles localization context. No external data sources, system commands, or network operations are present. The use of Django's formatting functions is safe and appropriate. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are identified. The code serves a functional purpose within Django templates and does not perform any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django template extension for localization control. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It operates within expected boundaries of template rendering and formatting.",
