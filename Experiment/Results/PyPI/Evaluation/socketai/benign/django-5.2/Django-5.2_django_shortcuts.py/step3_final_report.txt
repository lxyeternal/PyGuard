  "purpose": "Helper functions for rendering templates, redirecting, and retrieving objects or lists from Django ORM, facilitating common web operations.",
  "sources": "Request data, model instances, URL parameters, and query arguments used in functions like reverse(), get(), filter(), and get_absolute_url().",
  "sinks": "URL resolution via reverse(), database queries (get, filter), HTTP response objects (HttpResponse, redirect responses).",
  "flows": "Input data from request or parameters flows into URL resolution, database queries, and response creation, potentially influencing redirect URLs or object retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; standard Django practices are followed.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Django helper functions with proper exception handling and async support. Inputs are handled cautiously, with fallback mechanisms for URL resolution. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The functions rely on trusted Django mechanisms, and no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident. The potential for misuse exists if inputs are unvalidated elsewhere, but within this module, the code is safe and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard, benign Django utility set with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified due to the potential for untrusted data influencing URL resolution or database queries, but no vulnerabilities are present within this code. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0.",
