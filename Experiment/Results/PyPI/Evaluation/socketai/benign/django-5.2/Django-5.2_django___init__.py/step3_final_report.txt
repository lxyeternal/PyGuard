  "purpose": "Standard Django application setup routine: configuring logging, URL prefix, and app registry.",
  "sources": "Django settings (LOGGING, FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME, INSTALLED_APPS), imported get_version for version info.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Configuration functions affect logging setup, URL prefix, and app registry population based on settings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard Django APIs, no obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports get_version to assign a version string, then defines setup() to configure logging, set URL prefix, and populate apps. All functions used are standard Django APIs with typical usage. No hardcoded secrets, external network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is routine initialization, with no suspicious behavior detected. The reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No evidence suggests malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django setup routine with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
