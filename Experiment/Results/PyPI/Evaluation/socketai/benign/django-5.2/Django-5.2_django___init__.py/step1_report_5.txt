  "purpose": "Configure Django application settings, logging, and URL prefix.",
  "sources": "Accesses get_version from django.utils.version; imports from django.* modules; accesses settings (settings.LOGGING_CONFIG, settings.LOGGING, settings.FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME, settings.INSTALLED_APPS).",
  "sinks": "set_script_prefix modifies URL prefix; configure_logging sets up logging based on provided config and logging dict.",
  "flows": "get_version retrieves version info; setup() reads Django settings; configure_logging and set_script_prefix modify system state based on settings; apps.populate initializes app registry.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. The use of standard Django functions and settings is typical; no obfuscated or dynamic code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and a setup function that configures logging and URL prefix based on Django settings. It uses standard Django modules and functions without any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The functions are straightforward, intended to initialize application configuration. No anomalous data flows or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django setup routine with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on well-known Django APIs and configurations, posing no security threats.",
