  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Django setup routine, involving importing `get_version`, configuring logging, setting URL script prefix, and populating the app registry.\n- No reports identify any malicious activity, suspicious logic, or obfuscation.\n- The code snippets are straightforward, relying on Django's well-known APIs and settings.\n- The `get_version` function is used solely for version string assignment; no evidence suggests it performs malicious operations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, dynamic code execution, or network activity are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and potential issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears correct and standard for Django applications.\n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports or the code itself indicate malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and readable.\n- **Security risks:** The only potential concern could be reliance on external settings, but this is typical in Django and not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring evaluation:\n\n| Issue | Report # | Report's Score | Justification for adjustment |\n|---------|------------|----------------|------------------------------|\n| Malware | All | 0 | No malicious activity detected. The use of `get_version` and configuration functions is standard. |\n| Obfuscated | All | 0 | Code is clear and straightforward. |\n| Risk | All | 0.0 - 0.5 | The setup routine is typical; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are identified. |\n\n**Note:** Since all reports already assign scores of 0 or 0.5 for malware and obfuscated, and 0 for security risk, these seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — standard setup with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is standard Django setup code.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified based on the code.\n- The reliance on Django settings is typical and not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Metric | Final Estimate |\n|---------|----------------|\n| Malware | 0 |\n| Obfuscated | 0 |\n| Security Risk | 0 |\n\n**This code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.**",
