{
  "purpose": "To evaluate supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, anomalies, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources identified; code analysis is based solely on provided code snippets or placeholders.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or data handling points; however, none are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flows identified due to absence of code or minimal placeholder code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is either absent, placeholder, or minimal with no suspicious features.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate either no code or placeholder code, leading to low or zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risks. The high confidence in benign nature in some reports is justified by the lack of suspicious features. Slightly higher security risk scores in some cases reflect cautious reasoning despite no evidence. No report demonstrates malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the content, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippets and analysis, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the available information.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
