{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize and configure a Python package, possibly setting up some runtime parameters or importing necessary modules.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and reads environment variables for configuration settings.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables and configuration objects; no direct data sinks or untrusted output points evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at startup; configuration is loaded; no clear data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code. The code structure appears typical for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup or configuration tasks, importing modules and reading environment variables. No suspicious functions, network calls, or data exfiltration methods are present. The lack of dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling suggests no malicious intent. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup/configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and consistent with normal package initialization routines.",
