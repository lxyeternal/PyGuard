  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data from environment variables, network connections, configuration files, or standard library functions.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system, environment variables, or output streams where untrusted data could cause leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network or file outputs, with no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, eval/exec, or unusual code structures; code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate absence of malicious or suspicious code, with scores of malware and obfuscated set to 0, and security risk scores around 0.2, reflecting minimal external data handling concerns. Confidence levels are high, given the lack of concrete code snippets. The reasoning is consistent and justified across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. The overall assessment supports a safe usage profile.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
