  "purpose": "A Django template tag implementation for caching template fragments with dynamic expiration, cache name, and vary-on variables.",
  "sources": "Template variables resolved at runtime for expiration time, cache name, and vary-on parameters.",
  "sinks": "Cache get/set operations using generated cache keys based on template variables.",
  "flows": "Variables are resolved from context, used to generate cache keys, which are then used to retrieve or store cached content.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected. Use of variables for cache keys is standard but could be exploited if variables are maliciously crafted.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Django cache mechanisms with proper error handling. It dynamically resolves variables for cache expiration, cache backend selection, and vary-on parameters, then generates cache keys accordingly. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical caching patterns. The potential security concern is cache pollution if untrusted variables influence cache keys, but this is a common issue in cache design, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Django template cache tag implementation with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low to moderate security risk score (around 0.2) reflects typical concerns about untrusted input influencing cache keys but does not indicate malicious behavior. The malware score remains at 0, and obfuscation is absent. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
