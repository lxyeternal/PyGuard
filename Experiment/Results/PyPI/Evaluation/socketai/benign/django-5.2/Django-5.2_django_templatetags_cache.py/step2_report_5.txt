  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard cache tag implementation, variables are resolved from the template context.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cache get/set based on generated keys from variables.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or obfuscation. Use of untrusted variables for cache keys is standard but could be exploited if variables are maliciously crafted.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malware, low risk (0.2), high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** The logic is sound, and no malicious intent is evident. The risk score is appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar standard cache implementation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses Django cache API with variable inputs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malware, very low risk (0.1), high confidence (1).\n\n**Assessment:** Again, standard behavior, no concerns about malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cache with variable expiration, cache keys, multiple backends.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows through cache get/set with variable inputs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious behavior, standard Django practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malware, low risk (0.2), high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** Legitimate caching code, no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cache with variable cache keys, multiple backends.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cache operations based on variable inputs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Potential for cache pollution if variables are malicious, but this is a common pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious code, standard pattern, risk score 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher concern about variable inputs influencing cache keys, but this is typical and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar cache implementation with variable cache keys.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cache get/set with variable inputs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious behavior, standard Django cache usage.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malware, risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Standard, safe code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior. The scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), reflecting potential cache pollution or misuse of variables, but not indicating any malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The code is a standard Django template cache tag implementation.\n- No signs of supply chain compromise, malicious code, or malware.\n- The risk scores are appropriate given the potential for cache pollution if variables are maliciously crafted, but this is a common concern with dynamic cache keys.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports, representing typical cache pollution concerns)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard Django caching utility with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. The risk scores are reasonable and should remain low unless further evidence emerges.",
