{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom Django template tag for caching template fragments with configurable expiration, cache backend, and variation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from template tag arguments, context variables, and cache configuration.",
  "sinks": "Uses Django's cache framework to store and retrieve data based on generated cache keys.",
  "flows": "Template tag arguments and context variables flow into cache key generation; cache retrieval or storage occurs based on these keys.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no unusual code patterns; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Django cache mechanisms with dynamic cache selection and key generation based on template parameters and context variables. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. It handles variable resolution securely with error handling and respects cache configuration options. There are no signs of data leakage, remote communication, or backdoors. The logic aligns with expected caching practices and contains no obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a Django template fragment cache tag with configurable options. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior was identified. It is a legitimate utility for caching in Django templates.",
