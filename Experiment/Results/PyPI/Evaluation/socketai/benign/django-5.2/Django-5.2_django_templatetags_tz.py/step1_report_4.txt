{
  "purpose": "The code provides Django template filters and tags for handling timezone conversions and display in templates, with custom handling of naive and aware datetime objects.",
  "sources": "Reads include timezone.get_current_timezone(), timezone.get_default_timezone(), zoneinfo.ZoneInfo, and input parameters such as timezone names or tzinfo objects.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the use of timezone conversions and context modifications, which could affect datetime display, but do not involve security-sensitive data transfer or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Input data (datetimes and timezone info) flows through timezone-aware conversions and template rendering, with no external system communication.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the 'datetimeobject' subclass used solely to add an attribute 'convert_to_local_time', but this is a benign workaround for datetime immutability. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly handles naive and aware datetime objects, converting them to specified time zones. It employs standard Django and Python timezone utilities. No external network calls, file operations, or credential handling occur. The custom subclass is for internal attribute assignment. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are detected. The logic appears consistent with timezone conversion functionalities without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements timezone conversion utilities for Django templates, with proper handling of datetime objects and time zones. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
