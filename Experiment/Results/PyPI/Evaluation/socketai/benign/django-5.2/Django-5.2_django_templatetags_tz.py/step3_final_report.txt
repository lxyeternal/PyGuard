{
  "purpose": "The code provides timezone conversion filters and tags for Django templates, handling naive and aware datetime objects, with exception handling to prevent crashes.",
  "sources": "Input from datetime objects, timezone strings, and template tokens; uses standard Django timezone utilities.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; internal conversions and attribute modifications within the code.",
  "flows": "Input datetime or timezone string → validation and exception handling → timezone conversion → returning modified datetime object with added attribute.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a subclass 'datetimeobject' to add an attribute 'convert_to_local_time' as a workaround for datetime immutability; broad exception handling suppresses errors silently.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of timezone handling in Django templates. The subclass 'datetimeobject' is used solely as a workaround for adding attributes, which is a known pattern and not malicious. Exception handling is broad but intended to prevent template crashes, not to hide malicious activity. No external network calls, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not obfuscate logic or contain malicious code. The only minor concern is the silent exception handling, which could mask bugs but does not pose a security threat. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and aligns with best practices for timezone management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The use of subclassing 'datetime' is a benign workaround, and exception handling is standard for such utility functions. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to silent error suppression, but does not constitute a security vulnerability. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, which is justified given the context.",
