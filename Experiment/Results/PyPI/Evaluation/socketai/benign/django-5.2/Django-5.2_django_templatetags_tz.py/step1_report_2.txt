{
  "purpose": "This code provides Django template filters and tags for handling timezone conversions and rendering datetime objects in templates.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include template variables, particularly datetime objects, and arguments passed to template tags such as timezone names or tzinfo instances.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include conversions of datetime objects to different time zones and rendering output in templates. No direct data leaks or system effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from template variables (sources) through timezone conversion functions and into rendered template output (sink). Conversion functions handle untrusted input but do not perform external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors are present. Use of try-except blocks prevents exceptions from propagating. ZoneInfo is used for timezone conversions; no obfuscation or malicious code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manipulates datetime objects, converting between time zones, and rendering in templates. It uses standard Django and Python libraries for timezone handling. The use of a subclass for datetime objects is benign. The code ensures exceptions are caught to prevent crashes. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications are observed. All operations are within expected patterns for timezone handling. There are no backdoors, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of timezone-aware template filters and tags for Django. It performs no malicious or security-compromising actions. The code is well-structured and uses safe practices for timezone handling. Overall, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
