{
  "purpose": "To invoke Django's management commands when the script is run directly, allowing command-line management tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's execution context (__name__ == \"__main__\") and imports from django.core.management.",
  "sinks": "The function management.execute_from_command_line() executes command-line instructions, which could include untrusted input if command arguments are supplied externally.",
  "flows": "User runs the script with command-line arguments; these are passed to execute_from_command_line(), which processes them and executes the corresponding Django management commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard pattern for Django management scripts. There is no hardcoded secret, malicious payload, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script checks if it's being run as the main module, then invokes Django's management commands via execute_from_command_line(). This is a typical entry point for Django projects. No external data sources are directly read within the script; command-line arguments are handled by Django's management system, which is expected behavior. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign entry point for Django management commands with no malicious behavior detected. It does not contain obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The overall security risk is minimal.",
