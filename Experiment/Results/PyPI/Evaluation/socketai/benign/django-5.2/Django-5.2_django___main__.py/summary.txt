  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Django management entry point with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The slight security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports is justified due to the inherent risk of executing arbitrary commands via command-line input, but the code itself is safe. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The overall security posture is minimal risk, relying on Django's internal validation to prevent malicious command execution."
