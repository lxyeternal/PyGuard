  "purpose": "Standard Django CLI entry point that invokes management commands when run as a script.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments passed to the script, imported from django.core.management",
  "sinks": "Management.execute_from_command_line() processes the command-line input, potentially executing commands",
  "flows": "Command-line input flows into django's management system via execute_from_command_line()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward invocation of Django management commands",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Django CLI script that calls execute_from_command_line() when run directly. It relies on Django's internal validation and command execution framework, which is designed to be secure. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The potential security concern is that malicious commands could be executed if supplied by the user, but this is inherent to command-line tools and managed by Django's validation. The code itself is not obfuscated and does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Django management entry point with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The slight security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports is justified due to the inherent risk of executing arbitrary commands via command-line input, but the code itself is safe. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The overall security posture is minimal risk, relying on Django's internal validation to prevent malicious command execution.",
