{
  "purpose": "This code provides custom Django template tags and filters related to language translation, localization, and language switching within templates.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include template variables, token arguments, and parser-compiled filters such as language codes, message strings, and contextual options.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include assignment to context variables, rendering translation strings, and executing template rendering with user-provided data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from template variables and parser arguments (sources) to context assignments and translation functions (sinks). For example, user-supplied language codes and translation keys are processed and stored or rendered.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are detected. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic code execution is present. The code relies on Django's translation framework for localization.",
  "analysis": "The code implements template tags for fetching language information, current language, and enabling language switching, as well as translation tags with context and plural support. It uses standard Django translation functions and safely handles string rendering. There are no signs of data leaks, code injection, or malicious network activity. The code does not perform any dangerous file or system operations. It correctly uses Django's security practices, such as escaping unsafe data and leveraging the translation framework.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard implementation of Django translation and language switching tags. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It solely interacts with trusted Django translation APIs and template context variables, with no evidence of supply chain sabotage.",
