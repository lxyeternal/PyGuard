  "purpose": "Django internationalization and language management via template tags and nodes.",
  "sources": "Reads from settings.LANGUAGES, template variables, and context; uses Django translation API functions.",
  "sinks": "Assigns data to context variables, renders translation strings, uses compile_filter for variable resolution.",
  "flows": "Template variables resolved via compile_filter and resolve, then passed into translation functions, and stored in context.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, external network calls, or malicious patterns detected. Use of compile_filter is standard in Django tags.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Django translation and language management features. It handles data safely, uses Django APIs appropriately, and does not perform external system calls or code execution. No signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. The use of mark_safe is within contextually safe bounds, given translation strings are trusted. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and low inherent risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of Django's internationalization features with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score accurately reflects its safe nature.",
