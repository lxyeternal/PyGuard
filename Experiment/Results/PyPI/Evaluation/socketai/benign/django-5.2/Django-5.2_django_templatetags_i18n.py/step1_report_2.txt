  "purpose": "This code provides Django template tags and filters for handling language translation, localization, and language switching functionalities within templates.",
  "sources": "User-provided template tag arguments, filter inputs, and variables resolved in the template context.",
  "sinks": "Rendering functions (e.g., render_value_in_context), translation functions, context variable assignments, string formatting, and template rendering.",
  "flows": "Input data from template tags/filters flow through parsing and resolution, then into translation and rendering functions, which output localized strings or modify context variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of parser.compile_filter without sanitization, dynamic string formatting with user-controlled data, potential for context manipulation. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious external connections or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple Django template tags and filters related to language translation and localization, including dynamic translation, language switching, and language info retrieval. It processes input from templates and context variables, resolving them through Django's translation and context mechanisms. The functions primarily perform safe string translation, context updates, and formatting. No suspicious external network activity, file operations, or system modifications are present. The use of compile_filter is standard for Django template tags, and no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection is evident. The code follows standard practices for internationalization without any indicators of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of translation and language management template tags for Django. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are identified. The security risk score is low, and the malware score is minimal. The confidence in this assessment is high.",
