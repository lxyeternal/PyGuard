  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Confirms the code is a standard HTML DOM to text converter with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Logic:** Correct; no issues detected.\n- **Risk justification:** No reason to adjust scores; the code appears benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, confirms safe, standard parsing behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Logic:** Slightly higher securityRisk score; possibly considering minimal parsing complexity, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n- **Score adjustment:** The 0.1 securityRisk seems a bit high for such straightforward code. I would recommend lowering it to 0, as no security risk is evident.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—benign HTML parser.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Logic:** Consistent and correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard HTML to text conversion, no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Logic:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar benign assessment.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Logic:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior—no network activity, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report suggesting 0.1. Given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities, I recommend setting all securityRisk scores to **0** for consistency and accuracy.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is a standard, safe HTML parsing utility.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, no obfuscation, no external data leaks.\n- The minor securityRisk score in one report is unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n\n**Overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The initial scores suggesting minimal risk or malware are unwarranted.",
