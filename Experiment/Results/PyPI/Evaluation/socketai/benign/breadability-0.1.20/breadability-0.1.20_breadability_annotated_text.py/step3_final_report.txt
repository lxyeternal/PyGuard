  "purpose": "Converts an HTML DOM into annotated text by parsing semantic tags and grouping text accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reads input DOM via saxify and processes characters through startElementNS, endElementNS, and characters methods.",
  "sinks": "Stores processed text in internal content list; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "DOM input -> startElementNS/endElementNS updates _dom_path -> characters appends to _paragraph -> _append_paragraph processes and stores paragraphs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; straightforward use of standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard HTML DOM to text converter utilizing lxml.sax. It tracks semantic tags, groups text by tags, and appends processed paragraphs. No external network calls, code injection, or obfuscation are present. The logic is clear, with proper handling of start/end tags and character data. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code's simplicity and use of well-known libraries suggest benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard HTML DOM parser with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals and reports align in indicating a safe utility.",
