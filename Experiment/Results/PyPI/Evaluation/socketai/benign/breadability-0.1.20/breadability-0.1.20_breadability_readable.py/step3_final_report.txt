{
  "purpose": "The code is a content extraction and cleaning utility for HTML documents, primarily used to parse, score, and select the main content for readability purposes.",
  "sources": "DOM elements such as <body>, <div>, <p>, and other HTML tags; text content within these elements; attributes like class and href for filtering and scoring.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; the code manipulates DOM elements internally, cleans styles, removes certain nodes, and outputs cleaned HTML or text.",
  "flows": "Input HTML is parsed into a DOM; candidate nodes are scored based on heuristics; the best candidate and its siblings are cleaned and assembled into the final document or fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or external network activity. The code uses standard libraries and functions for HTML parsing and cleaning.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard HTML parsing, cleaning, and candidate scoring for readability extraction. It uses lxml for DOM manipulation, applies heuristics to remove unlikely nodes, and cleans inline styles and embedded objects unless they are recognized as safe videos. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The functions are typical for such tools, and the code does not perform any network operations or system modifications. The malware score is therefore 0, and the security risk is minimal, around 0.1, reflecting the benign nature of the operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source-like content extraction library with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores are consistent with its behavior, and no modifications are necessary.",
