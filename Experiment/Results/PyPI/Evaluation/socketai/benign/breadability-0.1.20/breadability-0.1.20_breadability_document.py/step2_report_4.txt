  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is primarily for HTML decoding, normalization, and parsing.\n   - No report indicates any actual vulnerability, malicious behavior, or suspicious code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, emphasizing the standard nature of the code.\n   - They correctly identify that regex-based charset detection is common, though potentially exploitable if HTML is maliciously crafted, but this is a known limitation rather than a flaw.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with their conclusion.\n   - Security risk scores are low (~0.1–0.2), consistent with the absence of external network activity or code execution.\n   - The confidence levels are high (0.9–0.95), reflecting a solid understanding that the code is safe.\n\n4. **Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a risk score above 0.5.\n   - The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries with no suspicious patterns.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that there's no malware present.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, sticking to factual analysis.\n   - They acknowledge potential minor issues (like regex charset detection) but do not overstate risks.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis—no overestimation or underestimation observed.\n\n**Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or code hiding)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (very low, standard HTML processing)\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n\nGiven the thorough review and consensus, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard, well-structured HTML processing utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Score |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1–0.2         |\n\n**Final Note:** No modifications to the existing scores are necessary. The code is safe, and the reports are accurate in their assessments.",
