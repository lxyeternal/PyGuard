{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to process and parse HTML documents, decode HTML content, convert specific tags, and extract information like links and title.",
  "sources": "Input HTML content provided to the decode_html, build_document, or OriginalDocument class; meta charset tags and external HTML sources (via URLs).",
  "sinks": "HTML parsing functions, string decoding, and link extraction functions; no explicit sinks that execute untrusted code or leak data are present.",
  "flows": "HTML input → decode_html (detect and decode encoding) → convert_breaks_to_paragraphs (sanitize breaks) → build_document (parse HTML) → access properties (links, title).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified. The code mainly processes HTML and does not perform external network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code robustly handles HTML decoding with charset detection, converts break tags into paragraphs, and builds an lxml HTML document. It uses safe parsing methods and applies common practices for HTML sanitization. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or sensitive data handling beyond HTML parsing is present. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious intent. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of parsing and cleaning HTML content.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is focused on HTML processing, decoding, and parsing without any malicious or suspicious elements. It does not contain malware or security risks. The code appears safe, well-structured, and aligned with its purpose.",
