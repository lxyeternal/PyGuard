  "purpose": "Retrieve and expose the version number of the 'breadability' package.",
  "sources": "pkg_resources.get_distribution('breadability').version",
  "sinks": "None evident; no direct data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only reads package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code primarily uses standard imports and a common method to get package version.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, uses 'pkg_resources' to obtain the version of the 'breadability' package, and assigns it to __version__. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs, no external network calls, and no user input handling. It appears to be a typical version declaration snippet for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply retrieves the version of a package and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard and safe.",
