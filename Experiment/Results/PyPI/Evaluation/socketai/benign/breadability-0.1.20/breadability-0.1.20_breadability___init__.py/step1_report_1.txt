  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the 'breadability' package installed in the environment.",
  "sources": "pkg_resources.get_distribution('breadability').version",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data output or external communication",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only assigns the package version to a variable",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists of standard import statements and a version retrieval",
  "analysis": "The code uses __future__ imports for compatibility, then imports pkg_resources to obtain the version of a specific package ('breadability'). The version is stored in __version__ for potential use elsewhere. No user input, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be a typical module versioning snippet with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign snippet used to determine the installed version of a package. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
