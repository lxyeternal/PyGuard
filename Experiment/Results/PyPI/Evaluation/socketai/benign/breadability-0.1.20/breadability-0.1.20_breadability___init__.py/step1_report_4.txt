  "purpose": "Retrieve and expose the version number of the 'breadability' package.",
  "sources": "pkg_resources.get_distribution('breadability').version",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external communication",
  "flows": "N/A, only static retrieval of package version",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. Use of __future__ imports is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, then retrieves the version of the 'breadability' package via pkg_resources. This is a common practice for package version reporting. No input from untrusted sources, no data leaks, or external communications are present. The code is minimal and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for retrieving package version information. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies present.",
