  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their assessments, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code snippets are minimal, standard, and commonly used for package version retrieval.\n- No user input, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The consistent use of __future__ imports and pkg_resources is standard practice.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, straightforward, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, standard version retrieval.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard code for package version reporting.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Same minimal, benign code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code snippets are all identical in purpose and structure, and all are benign.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0 in all reports; no malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation is evident.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1, justified by the straightforwardness and standard practice.\n\n### **Potential Improvements or Clarifications:**\n- The reports could explicitly mention that the code relies on `pkg_resources`, which may be considered deprecated in favor of `importlib.metadata` in newer Python versions (3.8+). However, this does not impact security.\n- No need to adjust scores; all are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**In conclusion,** all reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is a standard, safe snippet for retrieving package version info with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n| -------- | ------------ | ----- |\n| 0        | 0            | 0     |\n\n**This aligns with the current reports and the code's benign nature.**",
