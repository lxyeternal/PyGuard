  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code simply imports future features, imports `pkg_resources`, and retrieves the version of the 'breadability' package via `pkg_resources.get_distribution('breadability').version`, assigning it to `__version__`.\n- No user input, network activity, data leaks, or external communication.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets.\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard for version retrieval.\n\n**Step 2: Check for errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly note the absence of anomalies, suspicious behavior, or malicious intent.\n- The descriptions of data flow, sinks, and sources are accurate.\n- No report claims malicious activity or vulnerabilities that aren't present.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n- These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- The `malware` score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The `securityRisk` score is 0, which is justified.\n- No reason to increase these scores; the code is safe.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code does not process untrusted input or perform external communication.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all conclusions are appropriate.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure score consistency**\n\n- All scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n\n- The code is a minimal, standard snippet used in many Python packages for version reporting.\n- No modifications or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score |\n|------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                      |\n| Security Risk    | 0                      |\n\nThe reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
