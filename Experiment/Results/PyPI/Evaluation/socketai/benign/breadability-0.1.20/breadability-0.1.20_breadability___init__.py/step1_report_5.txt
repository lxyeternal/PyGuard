{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the 'breadability' package installed in the environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version information via pkg_resources.get_distribution('breadability').version.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks are present; the code only reads package metadata.",
  "flows": "The version data flows from the package metadata source to the __version__ variable.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code consists of standard package metadata retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with encoding declaration and future imports, which are common for compatibility. It then imports 'pkg_resources' to access package distribution data and assigns the version of 'breadability' to __version__. This is a typical pattern in Python packages for version management. No input from external sources, user input, or network activity is involved. The code does not perform any malicious actions, data leakage, or obfuscated behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, only retrieving and storing the version number of a specific package. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
