  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the 'breadability' package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package distribution metadata via pkg_resources.get_distribution().version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "Source: get_distribution() call; no data flows to sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version retrieval with standard imports and no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, then uses pkg_resources to obtain the version of 'breadability'. It assigns this to __version__. There are no inputs, outputs, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The code is minimal, standard, and benign. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. All signals indicate a safe, routine operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard snippet for retrieving a package version. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
