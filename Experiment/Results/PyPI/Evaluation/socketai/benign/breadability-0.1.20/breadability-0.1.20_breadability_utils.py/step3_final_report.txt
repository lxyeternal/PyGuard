  "purpose": "Utility functions for string processing: checking blank strings, normalizing whitespace, shrinking text, and a memoized property decorator.",
  "sources": "Input strings to functions such as is_blank, shrink_text, normalize_whitespace; class attribute access for cached_property.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions process input strings only, with no external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through normalization and checks; no external data flows or untrusted sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard regex and utility functions; fallback ignored context manager is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code provides string utility functions and a caching decorator, with no external data handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. The regex and functions are standard and safe. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code is benign and purely utility-focused.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
