{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for text normalization, whitespace management, and a memoization decorator, primarily intended for general text processing and class property caching.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded regex patterns and class method calls; it does not take external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks that handle untrusted input or output, such as network connections, file writes, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The functions process text internally; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or hidden behaviors. The ignored context manager is standard and not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for whitespace normalization and string handling, along with a memoization decorator. No external data sources are accessed, and no potentially malicious or suspicious behaviors are observed. The regex pattern is simple and safe. The ignored context manager is a common pattern. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for straightforward utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign utility module for text processing and property caching, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
