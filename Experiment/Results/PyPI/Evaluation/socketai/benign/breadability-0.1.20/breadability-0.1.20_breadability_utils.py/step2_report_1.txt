  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as utility functions for string processing and a memoized property decorator.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or sensitive data handling are involved.\n- No suspicious or obfuscated code patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature described.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: functions for whitespace normalization, blank string checks, and a caching decorator.\n- The import fallback for 'ignored' is standard, and the regex pattern is straightforward.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The code does not contain any external data interactions or security-sensitive operations, so the assigned scores of 0 for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n- The code's logic is simple and standard, with no assumptions that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 is justified; no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is justified; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified; no security risks are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified based on the code's content.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign utility module with no security concerns.",
