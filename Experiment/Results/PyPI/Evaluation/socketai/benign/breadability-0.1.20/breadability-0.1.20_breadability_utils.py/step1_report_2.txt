  "purpose": "Utility functions for string normalization, whitespace management, and a property decorator for caching.",
  "sources": "The code reads string input parameters for functions such as 'is_blank', 'shrink_text', and 'normalize_whitespace'. No external or untrusted data sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "The functions process and return strings; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are received by functions, processed internally (e.g., whitespace normalization), and returned. No untrusted data flows to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The use of 'ignored' context manager is standard and harmless. The code primarily offers utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for string processing and a caching decorator. It includes standard practices such as exception handling for compatibility. No external or untrusted data sources are used, nor are there any code injections, network communications, or malicious behaviors. The functions operate on input parameters and do not perform side effects beyond string manipulation. The 'ignored' context manager is a compatibility utility and not malicious. Overall, the code appears benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely provides string normalization and a caching decorator. No malicious intent or suspicious activities are present.",
