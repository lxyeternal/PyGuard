{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for text normalization, whitespace handling, and a decorator for cached properties, likely intended for general use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read external input or data sources; they operate on passed parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; all functions process internal data passed as arguments.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. The ignored context manager is a common pattern for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex-based whitespace normalization, string trimming, and a memoization decorator. It uses standard libraries and patterns. No external data sources, network operations, or security-sensitive actions are present. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as utility functions for text processing and property caching. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
