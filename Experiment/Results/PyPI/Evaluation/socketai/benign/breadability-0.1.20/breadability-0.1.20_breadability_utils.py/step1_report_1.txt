  "purpose": "Utility functions for string processing, whitespace normalization, and a memoized property decorator.",
  "sources": "Input data is expected via function arguments (text). No external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; functions operate on provided input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines string manipulation utilities and a memoization decorator. It imports standard libraries, handles import fallback for 'ignored', compiles a regex for whitespace normalization, and defines functions that process input text without external data or side effects. No code interacts with network, filesystem, or sensitive data. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for string processing and caching. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
