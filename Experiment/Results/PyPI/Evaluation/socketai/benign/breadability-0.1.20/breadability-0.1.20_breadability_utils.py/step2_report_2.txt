  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the accuracy of their conclusions, the validity of their scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n- The code consists solely of utility functions for string processing, whitespace normalization, and a memoized property decorator.\n- There are no external data sources, network operations, file I/O, or interactions with sensitive data.\n- The code uses standard Python libraries and patterns.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The 'ignored' context manager is a fallback for compatibility and is benign.\n- All reports consistently conclude the code is benign, with malware and security risk scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n1. **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n   - **Yes.** The reports correctly identify that the code is purely utility functions with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning?**  \n   - **No.** All reports correctly interpret the code as benign and utility-focused.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`.  \n   - These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   - None of the reports assign high risk scores, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score reflection:**  \n   - All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, matching the malware score of 0.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   - No such claims are made; all assessments are cautious and based on code analysis.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n\n- **Is there any overlooked malicious or obfuscated content?**  \n  - No. The code is straightforward and well-understood utility functions.\n\n- **Potential issues not captured?**  \n  - No. All aspects point to benign utility code.\n\n- **Are the scores appropriate?**  \n  - Yes. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\nGiven the thorough review, I agree with the provided assessments. The code is standard, safe, and free from malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Aspect             | Score |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Malware            | 0      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      |\n| Security Risk      | 0      |\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious activity detected.  \n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.  \n- No security vulnerabilities evident in utility functions.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign utility code with no security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Confirm the current scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.  \n- Maintain the conclusion that this code is safe and non-malicious.\n\n---\n\n**System note:**  \nProceed with this assessment, and no further action is required.",
