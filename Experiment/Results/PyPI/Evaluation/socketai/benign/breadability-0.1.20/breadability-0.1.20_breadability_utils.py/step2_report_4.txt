  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Utility functions for string processing: `is_blank`, `shrink_text`, `normalize_whitespace`.\n- Regex pattern to normalize whitespace (`MULTIPLE_WHITESPACE_PATTERN`).\n- `_replace_whitespace` helper function.\n- Compatibility handling for `ignored` context manager.\n- `cached_property` decorator for memoization.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- No external data sources, network calls, or file I/O.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- The code is purely utility functions for string handling and caching.\n- The `ignored` context manager is a standard pattern for exception suppression.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All consistently state that the code is benign, utility-focused, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- They correctly identify the purpose, sources, sinks, and data flows.\n- They note the absence of obfuscation, external data handling, or malicious patterns.\n- Confidence is high (1), and malware/security risk scores are 0 in all reports.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- No issues are found in the code.\n- The scores assigned seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- The code is a typical utility module with no suspicious or malicious intent.\n- The use of `ignored` for compatibility is harmless.\n- The regex and functions are safe and standard.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### My final estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews and the nature of the code.",
