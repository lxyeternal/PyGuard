  "purpose": "Utility functions for string normalization, whitespace handling, and a cached property decorator.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from string parameters in functions like is_blank, shrink_text, and normalize_whitespace.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external interactions are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through whitespace normalization functions, with no external or sensitive data flow outside string manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward utility functions with standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns and functions for string processing, including whitespace normalization and blank string checks. It uses a context manager fallback, which is standard. The cached_property decorator implements memoization for class properties. No external I/O, network, or file operations are present. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for text processing with no malicious behavior, no suspicious or anomalous code elements. It is safe and typical of open-source utility modules.",
