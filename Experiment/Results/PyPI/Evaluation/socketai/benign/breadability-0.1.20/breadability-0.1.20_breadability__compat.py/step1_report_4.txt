  "purpose": "Utility module for handling string and byte conversions across Python 2 and 3, and for making classes unicode compatible.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys.version_info, urllib2/urllib for URL handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no data flow to untrusted sources or sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides compatibility functions for string and bytes handling between Python 2 and 3, including decorators for unicode compatibility. It conditionally imports URL handling modules depending on Python version, which is standard. The functions `to_string`, `to_bytes`, and `to_unicode` convert data types with error handling for Unicode errors. There are no indications of data leaks, code injections, or malicious code. The import and usage patterns are standard for compatibility layers.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward compatibility utility for string and URL handling across Python versions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious activity or malware is detected.",
