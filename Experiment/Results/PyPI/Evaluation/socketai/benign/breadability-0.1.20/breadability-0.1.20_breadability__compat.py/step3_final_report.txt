  "purpose": "Compatibility utilities for handling string types (bytes, unicode) across Python 2 and 3, including URL module imports and class decorators.",
  "sources": "In-memory string objects, class definitions, version_info from sys module",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or data leaks; operations confined to in-memory objects",
  "flows": "Functions convert between bytes and unicode, decorators modify class methods; no external data flow or untrusted input processing",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard compatibility layer for Python 2/3 string handling, with functions for converting objects to bytes or unicode, and a decorator for unicode compatibility. It conditionally imports URL modules based on Python version. The code operates solely on in-memory objects and class definitions, with no external input/output, network activity, or data exfiltration. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The functions include proper error handling for Unicode errors, and the import patterns are standard for cross-version support. All signals indicate benign, utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard compatibility utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
