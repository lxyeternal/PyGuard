{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing and possibly communicates over the network, likely for data collection or processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown, but potential data inputs could come from environment variables, user input, or imported modules. No clear external data sources are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions (such as socket connections or HTTP requests), file writes, or environment variable usage could serve as sinks. Specific functions are not clearly shown in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Potential data flows from data sources (user input, environment variables) to sinks (network or file operations). Exact flow paths are not clearly identified due to limited code visibility.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures are immediately evident. The code uses standard Python constructs with no obfuscated features. However, the lack of context makes full assessment difficult.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal and does not display explicit data sources or sinks. No suspicious patterns, such as code injection, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity, are visible. The structure appears straightforward and standard. Without further context, no malicious behavior can be confirmed. The code's purpose seems benign but incomplete for a full security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and lacks suspicious anomalies. However, due to limited visibility into full functionality, low confidence is maintained in this conclusion.",
