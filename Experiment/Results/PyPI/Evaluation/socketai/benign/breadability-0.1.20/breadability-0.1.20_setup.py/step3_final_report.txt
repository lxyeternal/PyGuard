{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup configuration script for the 'breadability' Python package, defining dependencies, versioning, and entry points for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' and 'CHANGELOG.rst' files for long description; uses sys.version_info for version suffix; defines dependencies and console scripts; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "Calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata; no untrusted data processing or code execution; no network or file system effects beyond standard packaging.",
  "flows": "Reads static files to build long description; formats console script names with version suffix; passes static data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or unusual behaviors detected; standard use of dynamic string formatting for script names.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks without executing untrusted code or performing malicious actions. It reads documentation files, constructs version suffixes based on Python version, defines dependencies, and specifies entry points. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code structure and content align with standard practices for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
