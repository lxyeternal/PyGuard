  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'breadability' Python package, handling package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst and CHANGELOG.rst files; accessing sys.version_info; importing setuptools; defining variables and lists.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed in a way that affects system security or leaks information.",
  "flows": "File reads for long description -> variable assignments -> package setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscation; straightforward setup script with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It reads files for descriptions and dynamically formats console script names based on the Python version. No untrusted input, external data fetching, or sensitive data processing occurs. The code appears standard for a setup script, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code insertion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious activity are detected.",
