{
  "purpose": "This code handles scoring of HTML nodes for content extraction, assessing their relevance based on attributes, text content, and heuristics.",
  "sources": "Reads node attributes ('class', 'id'), node text content, and child elements (links, images).",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; internal computations only, including hashing and regex matching.",
  "flows": "Source: node attributes and text; flow to scoring functions, link density calculation, and hash generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard regex patterns, hashing, and content analysis functions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign content scoring using regex for class/id heuristics, link density calculations, and node attribute checks. No network, file, or malicious payloads are present. The hashing function is used for node identification, not malicious purposes. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk near zero) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign HTML content scoring module with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores and assessments in all reports are accurate and justified.",
