{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to analyze HTML nodes for content extraction and scoring to identify main content areas in web pages.",
  "sources": "Reads HTML node attributes, text content, and inner HTML via lxml functions such as node.get(), node.text_content(), and node.findall().",
  "sinks": "Calculates hash IDs, link density, and node weights; no direct data leaks or unsafe output operations identified.",
  "flows": "Extracts node attributes and text → computes link density and weights → scores nodes based on heuristics → generates hash IDs for nodes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code uses regular expressions for tag and attribute classification, typical for content analysis.",
  "analysis": "The script performs content analysis through regex-based classification of nodes, computes link density, and assigns scores to HTML nodes based on their tags, classes, and ids. It generates hash IDs for nodes and evaluates whether nodes are unlikely to be content or potential candidates for main content extraction. All functions rely on standard and safe operations: string processing, regex matching, hashing, and lxml DOM methods. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be part of a web content parsing library with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a content extraction utility for HTML documents, implementing heuristic scoring based on node attributes and content. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. No supply chain attack indicators or obfuscation patterns are present.",
