{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to verify Python files in a specific directory for proper encoding, filename case, absence of spaces, and correct license declaration.",
  "sources": "The code reads file contents to verify encoding and license information; it also reads filenames for validation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the script only reads files and filenames without executing untrusted data or writing to external systems.",
  "flows": "File reading functions source data from the filesystem, and the license verification reads file contents; data flows from disk into logs and process flow control.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of sensitive data. The license check is standard. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script performs file system operations: it searches for Python files, reads their contents, and performs validation checks (encoding, filename case, spaces, license). It uses standard libraries (glob, os, sys, logging). The logic is straightforward and does not involve any obfuscation, malicious data handling, or suspicious code patterns. There are no external communications or actions that could be malicious, and the functions only read data and log errors. All operations are related to code quality enforcement, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for codebase validation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is to ensure code quality and license compliance without any signs of sabotage or malware.",
