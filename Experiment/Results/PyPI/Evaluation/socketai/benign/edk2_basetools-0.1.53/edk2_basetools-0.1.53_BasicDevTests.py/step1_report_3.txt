{
  "purpose": "The script checks Python files in a specific directory for encoding, filename case, spaces in the path, and license compliance.",
  "sources": "Reads file contents for encoding and license verification; reads filenames for case and space checks.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is sent over network or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Reads file contents to verify encoding and license; reads filenames for format checks; logs errors based on these checks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors or hidden functionality; straightforward validation logic. Uses exception handling but does not process untrusted input beyond standard file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file validation in a controlled manner: it reads files to check encoding, verifies filenames for lowercase and absence of spaces, and ensures license headers are present. No network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code is primarily for quality enforcement, with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors. Exception handling is used for robustness but not for malicious purposes. The overall structure is simple, procedural, and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility script intended for codebase consistency checks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. It performs file validations with no indications of malicious intent.",
