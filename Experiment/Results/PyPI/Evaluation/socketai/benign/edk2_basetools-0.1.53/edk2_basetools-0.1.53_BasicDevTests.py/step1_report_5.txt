{
  "purpose": "The script verifies Python files in a directory for proper encoding, filename casing, absence of spaces, and correct licensing information.",
  "sources": "The script reads files from the 'edk2toollib' directory and its subdirectories.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations to check encoding and license content; no untrusted input or output flows identified.",
  "flows": "Reads file contents for encoding and license validation; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard file I/O and logging; no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward validation checks on files—reading files in binary mode, decoding content, and verifying filename and license format. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input that could lead to security issues. No hardcoded credentials or hidden backdoors observed. The purpose appears to be static code quality and license compliance verification. No signs of malicious intent or supply chain attack vectors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign utility for codebase validation, with no indications of malware or security risks. It operates solely on local files for validation purposes.",
