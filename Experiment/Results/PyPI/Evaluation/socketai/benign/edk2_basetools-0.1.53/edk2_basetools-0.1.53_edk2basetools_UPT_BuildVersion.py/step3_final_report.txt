  "purpose": "Define a build version string for the software, indicating a developer build with an unknown revision.",
  "sources": "The static assignment of the variable gBUILD_VERSION; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "N/A; static variable assignment with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with comments and a single variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static variable assignment indicating build version info. It contains only comments and a single string assignment, with no input/output, external communication, or dynamic behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, serving solely as a placeholder for build version information. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk present. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
