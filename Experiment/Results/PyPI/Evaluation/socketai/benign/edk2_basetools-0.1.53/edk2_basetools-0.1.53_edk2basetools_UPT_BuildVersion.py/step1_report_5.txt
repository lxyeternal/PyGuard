  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code or backdoors. The version string is static and not dynamic.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a string variable indicating the build version, with a default value. It contains standard comments and licensing information but does not perform any input/output operations, network activity, or code execution. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
