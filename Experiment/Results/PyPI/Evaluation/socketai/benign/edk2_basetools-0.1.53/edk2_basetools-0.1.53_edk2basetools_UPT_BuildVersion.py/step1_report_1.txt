  "purpose": "Define build version information for the software, specifically setting a version string.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, output, or external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple script that defines a version string variable 'gBUILD_VERSION' with a fixed value. There are no input operations, data processing, external calls, or suspicious constructs. The comments indicate it is for build version management. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a placeholder for build version information. It poses no security risk or malware concern.",
