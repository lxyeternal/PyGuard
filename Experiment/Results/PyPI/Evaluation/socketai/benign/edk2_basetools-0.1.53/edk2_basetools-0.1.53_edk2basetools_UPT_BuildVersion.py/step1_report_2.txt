  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright statement and SPDX license identifier, but no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and a single variable assignment setting a version string to a static value. No input reading, no data processing, no code execution, or external communication. It appears to be a simple informational declaration. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, nor any indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign script that assigns a version string; no malicious activity or security issues are present.",
