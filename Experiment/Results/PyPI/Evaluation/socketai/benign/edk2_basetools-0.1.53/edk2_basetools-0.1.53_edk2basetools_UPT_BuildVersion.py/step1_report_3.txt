{
  "purpose": "The code is used for generating build version information, specifically for managing version numbers during build processes.",
  "sources": "The code defines a single variable 'gBUILD_VERSION' with a string value.",
  "sinks": "No input/output operations, no untrusted data handling, no data leaks, or external communication present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted data; the variable is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed. The comment indicates it's for versioning and build info.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a file comment header, licensing information, and a single variable assignment setting a version string to a static value. There are no input sources, no sinks, and no data flows. The static string does not contain any malicious payload or behavior. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose in build versioning, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, solely for setting a version string in a build process. It shows no malicious behavior or security risks.",
