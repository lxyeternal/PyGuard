  "purpose": "This code is intended to provide build version information for a software project, specifically for generating version numbers automatically.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the hardcoded string assigned to gBUILD_VERSION.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or outputs; the code does not process external inputs or output sensitive data.",
  "flows": "The flow is static assignment; there are no dynamic or untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is simple and static with no unusual behavior or obfuscated segments.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining a string variable for build version info. It contains no external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no embedded malicious behavior. The comments indicate it's used for version tracking, with no suspicious activity present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves only to store static build version info, and presents no security risks or malicious intent.",
