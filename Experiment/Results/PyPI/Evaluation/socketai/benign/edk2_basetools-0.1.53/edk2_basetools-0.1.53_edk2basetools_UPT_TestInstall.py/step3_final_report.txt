{
  "purpose": "The code is a testing utility for installing multiple distribution packages, unzipping files, checking dependencies, logging results, and cleaning up temporary files.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from Options.DistFiles, environment variables from GlobalData, and external modules such as UnZipDp and DependencyRules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the cleanup routine with shutil.rmtree() and file handling via DistFile.Close() and ContentZipFile.Close().",
  "flows": "Data flows from Options.DistFiles through UnZipDp to dependency checking, then to logging, and finally to cleanup routines.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are detected. The cleanup process assumes controlled environment; no anomalies are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package testing operations with proper exception handling and cleanup. External modules are assumed legitimate. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The cleanup routine could pose risks if environment variables are manipulated, but this is typical in testing scripts. The code's logic is straightforward and aligns with its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs expected tasks, and shows no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
