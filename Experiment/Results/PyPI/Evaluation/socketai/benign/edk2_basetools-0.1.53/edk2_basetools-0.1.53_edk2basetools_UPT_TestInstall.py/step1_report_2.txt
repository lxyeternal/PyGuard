{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform installation and dependency checking for distribution packages, including unzipping files, dependency validation, and cleanup operations.",
  "sources": "Options.DistFiles input, Options.DistFiles list, global data, environment variables like python_version and platform, and unzipped content files.",
  "sinks": "Logger output, shutil.rmtree (deleting temporary directories), and file handles for cleanup.",
  "flows": "Input options.DistFiles are unzipped, dependencies are checked via DependencyRules, and logs are produced. Temporary files and directories are cleaned up at the end.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or unusual code behaviors. The code mainly manages files, dependencies, and logging without dynamic code execution or external data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code manages installation procedures: unzipping packages, dependency validation, and cleanup. It uses external modules for logging and dependency checking. No suspicious data flows or malicious code patterns are evident. The exception handling is standard, capturing errors and logging them. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs legitimate package installation and dependency verification tasks. No indicators of malicious behavior or malware are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to normal operational patterns.",
