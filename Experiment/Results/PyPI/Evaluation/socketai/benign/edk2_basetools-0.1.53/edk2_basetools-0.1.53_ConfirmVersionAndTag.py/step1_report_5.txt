{
  "purpose": "The script verifies the presence and format of a wheel file in the 'dist' directory, ensures the version is properly formatted and not a development version, and optionally creates and pushes a git tag if running on a CI server.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('AGENT_ID', 'SYSTEM_JOBID'), reads files in the 'dist' directory, and imports 'RunCmd' from 'edk2toollib.utility_functions'.",
  "sinks": "Executes shell commands via 'RunCmd' to create and push git tags.",
  "flows": "Checks for wheel files -> Validates version format -> If on CI server, runs 'git' commands to create and push tags.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code flow is straightforward. No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Uses environment variables to determine CI context but does not reveal secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script performs file system operations to locate wheel files, validates the version string to ensure it follows semantic versioning and is not a development version, and conditionally executes git commands based on environment variables indicating CI environment. The use of 'RunCmd' to run git commands is standard for automation. No suspicious or malicious behavior, no code injection, no backdoors, and no data leakage observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate release validation and tagging script for CI/CD pipelines. It performs checks and manages git tags without any malicious intent or harmful actions. No security concerns identified based on the provided code.",
