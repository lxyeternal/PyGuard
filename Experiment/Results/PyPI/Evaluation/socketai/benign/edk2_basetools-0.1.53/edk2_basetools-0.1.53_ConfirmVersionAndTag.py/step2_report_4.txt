  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- The script verifies that exactly one wheel file exists in the `dist` directory.\n- It extracts the version from the filename, ensuring it follows the `major.minor.patch` format and does not contain \"dev\".\n- If running in a CI environment (detected via `AGENT_ID` or `SYSTEM_JOBID`), it creates and pushes a git tag for the version.\n- The code uses a controlled external function `RunCmd` for executing system commands.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code is present.\n- The main actions are validation and optional tagging/pushing, typical for release automation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Discrepancies:\n\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  All reports agree that the script performs straightforward validation and release tagging. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or code injection is evident.\n\n- **Malware or malicious behavior:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—nothing malicious is present.\n\n- **Potential security risks:**  \n  The only notable activity is executing `git` commands, which could modify repository state. However, this is controlled via environment variables and is standard in CI/CD workflows. The risk score of around 0.1–0.2 seems appropriate.\n\n- **Use of external commands:**  \n  The script relies on `RunCmd` to execute `git` commands, which is acceptable and controlled.\n\n- **Obfuscation or suspicious patterns:**  \n  No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n  The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they treat the script as a standard release utility.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Consistently 0 across reports, justified by the absence of malicious code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  0, as no obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Slight variation (0.1–0.2), justified by the fact that executing `git push` could alter repository state, but only in controlled CI environments. This is standard practice, so the risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable given the code's behavior.\n- No change needed; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The overall security posture is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final System-Wide Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** ~0.1 — minimal risk due to external command execution in CI context, but generally safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe script is a standard release validation and tagging utility, with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports correctly reflect this understanding.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, performs standard release validation, and executes controlled external commands for tagging in CI/CD pipelines. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
