{
  "purpose": "The script verifies the presence of a single wheel file in the 'dist' directory, validates its version format (major.minor.patch, no 'dev' versions), and if running in a CI environment, creates and pushes a git tag corresponding to the version.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'dist' directory for wheel files, reads environment variables 'AGENT_ID' and 'SYSTEM_JOBID', and extracts version info from the filename.",
  "sinks": "Executes 'git' commands via RunCmd to create and push tags when in CI environment.",
  "flows": "Detects wheel file -> extracts version -> validates version format -> if in CI, runs 'git' commands to tag and push.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; straightforward version validation and tagging logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard release validation: locating wheel files, parsing version, ensuring format, and conditionally creating git tags based on environment variables. It uses external 'RunCmd' for executing system commands, which is typical in CI/CD workflows. No malicious or suspicious activity is present; the external commands are controlled and standard. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors. The risk primarily stems from executing 'git' commands, but this is controlled by environment variables and is standard practice in release scripts. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard release utility used in CI/CD pipelines for version validation and tagging. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and reflect the low security risk.",
