{
  "purpose": "This script verifies the presence and format of a wheel file, checks the version for correctness, and optionally creates and pushes a git tag if running on a server.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (AGENT_ID, SYSTEM_JOBID), reads the current working directory, and reads wheel files from the 'dist' directory.",
  "sinks": "Executes external commands via RunCmd to create and push git tags, which could alter repository state.",
  "flows": "Checks environment variables -> conditionally executes RunCmd to create and push git tags based on environment -> terminates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code. No suspicious obfuscation or unusual behaviors. The only notable activity is the optional git tagging and pushing, which is controlled by environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward validation of wheel files and versions, then conditionally creates git tags and pushes them. It uses standard Python libraries and a controlled external function RunCmd. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system damage, or backdoor creation. Its purpose is to verify package readiness and automate tagging in a CI/CD environment. The only potential concern is the remote git push, which could modify repository state, but this is a normal part of release workflows and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for release management in CI/CD pipelines. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The only notable action is optional git tagging and pushing, which is typical in automated release scripts.",
