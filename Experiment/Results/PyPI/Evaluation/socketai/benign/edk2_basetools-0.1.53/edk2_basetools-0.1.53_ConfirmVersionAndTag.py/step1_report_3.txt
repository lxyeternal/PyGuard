  "purpose": "Verify the version of the built wheel file and create a git tag if running on a CI server.",
  "sources": "os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"dist\"), glob.glob to list wheel files, environment variables 'AGENT_ID' and 'SYSTEM_JOBID', imported RunCmd function, and the wheel filename to extract version.",
  "sinks": "RunCmd function calls executing 'git' commands to create and push tags.",
  "flows": "The code reads the wheel file name, extracts version info, and conditionally executes git commands to tag and push the version based on environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; the only potential concern is executing 'git' commands based on environment variables, which is typical in CI but should be controlled. No suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script checks for exactly one wheel file in the 'dist' directory, extracts its version, and enforces a format without 'dev' tags. If running on a CI server (detected via environment variables), it creates and pushes a git tag for the version. All operations are straightforward and standard for release scripts. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior detected. The use of RunCmd to execute git commands is normal in build automation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs version validation and tagging for release purposes without any malicious intent. It appears to be a legitimate release utility script with no security risks or malware suspected.",
