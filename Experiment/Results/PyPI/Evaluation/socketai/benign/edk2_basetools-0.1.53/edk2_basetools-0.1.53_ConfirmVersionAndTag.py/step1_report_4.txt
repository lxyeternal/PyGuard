{
  "purpose": "This script verifies the version of the built wheel file and optionally creates and pushes a git tag if run on a server environment, to ensure proper version tagging before release.",
  "sources": "Reads the current working directory, the 'dist' folder for wheel files, environment variables ('AGENT_ID', 'SYSTEM_JOBID'), and command-line input.",
  "sinks": "Executes 'git' commands to create and push tags, and prints output for verification.",
  "flows": "Identifies the wheel file in 'dist', extracts version, verifies format, and conditionally runs 'git' commands to create and push tags based on environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code. The script's main functionality is straightforward version and release validation. The only noteworthy behavior is the execution of external 'git' commands conditioned on environment variables, which is typical for CI/CD pipelines.",
  "analysis": "The code searches for wheel files in a specific directory, checks for exactly one wheel, validates the version format, and ensures it's not a development version. It then conditionally executes external 'git' commands to create and push tags if environment variables indicating a server environment are present. The use of 'RunCmd' from an external library appears controlled and safe in this context. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The script performs standard release validation tasks without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward release validation and tagging utility, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. Its only external interactions are with 'git', which are conditioned on environment variables typical for CI/CD pipelines. No malware or malicious intent detected.",
