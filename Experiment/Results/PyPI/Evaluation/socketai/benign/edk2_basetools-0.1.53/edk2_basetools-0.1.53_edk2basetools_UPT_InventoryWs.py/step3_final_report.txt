  "purpose": "Retrieve and log distribution package information from the internal UPT database, providing inventory details.",
  "sources": "Data retrieved from GlobalData.gDB via InventoryDistInstalled()",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs; no untrusted data processing or external communication",
  "flows": "Data flows from the database call to formatted logging statements",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data retrieval and logging with standard exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code accesses a global database object to retrieve installed distribution info, formats the data, and logs it. Error handling captures specific exceptions and logs errors without executing untrusted code or network activity. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The data source could be compromised externally, but within this code, behavior is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe utility for inventory data display. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score is justified by its minimal attack surface, assuming the database source remains trustworthy.",
