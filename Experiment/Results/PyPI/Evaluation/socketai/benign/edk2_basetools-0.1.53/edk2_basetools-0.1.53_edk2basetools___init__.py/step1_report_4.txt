  "purpose": "Initialize a Python package to be recognized as a module by the interpreter.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows present; the code only contains comments and a docstring.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard package init file with no suspicious content.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of comments, a SPDX license identifier, and a docstring. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets, input handling, or suspicious constructs are present. The license and copyright comments are standard, and the docstring serves as a placeholder for initialization logic if needed. The absence of code logic indicates no malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package initialization file with no signs of malicious code or security risks. It does not perform any actions beyond defining the package structure.",
