  "conclusion": "The code is a legacy, platform-specific compatibility workaround that employs unsafe practices but does not contain malicious or maliciously intended behavior. The scores across reports are justified and consistent with the code's benign purpose. No modifications are necessary; the primary concern is the unsafe API usage, which could cause stability issues but not security breaches."
