  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script manages unpacking, dependency checking, file copying, and metadata generation. It uses user input, filesystem access, and environment variables. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or backdoors. The code performs standard package management tasks.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent with the code. The low security risk score (0.2) reflects that the main concern is user input and file handling, which are typical in such scripts. The high confidence (0.9) seems justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on unpacking, checksum verification, and file operations. User prompts are present, but no malicious activity is identified.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, standard checksum verification.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The very low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The slightly lower risk score (0.1) indicates minimal concern, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on unpacking, checksum, permission setting, and file management. Uses user input for paths. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Findings:** No network activity, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The risk score remains low, justified by the standard nature of the operations and validation functions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, handling unpacking, checksum, and file setup. User input is involved, but no malicious intent is evident.\n- **Findings:** No network activity, no obfuscation, standard validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion is appropriate. The risk remains low; the code is typical for an installer.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on unpacking, dependency checks, file copying, and metadata. User prompts are present, but no malicious activity detected.\n- **Findings:** No network activity, no obfuscation, standard validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code and previous reports. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently assign 0. The code performs standard file operations, checksum verification, and dependency management without any network activity or hidden commands. No malicious payloads or backdoors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly 0.1-0.2, reflecting the minimal security concern mainly around user input and path validation. These are typical in installer scripts and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n### **Final Expert Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — Slight concern over user input handling, but overall standard and safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured package installer with no malicious activity. The low risk score is appropriate given the context, and the malware/obfuscation scores should remain at zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consistent findings across all reports.",
