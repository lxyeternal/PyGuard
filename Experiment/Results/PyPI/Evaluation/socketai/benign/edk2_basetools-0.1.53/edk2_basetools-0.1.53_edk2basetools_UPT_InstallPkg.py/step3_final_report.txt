{
  "purpose": "The code manages unpacking, validation, copying files, setting permissions, checksum verification, and dependency checks during package installation. It interacts with the filesystem, user input, and environment variables to facilitate package deployment.",
  "sources": "User input via stdin for filename/path prompts; filesystem reads for zip extraction, file existence, and size; environment variables for paths; checksum verification reads for MD5 calculation.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (creating directories, copying files, setting permissions); logging outputs; checksum verification for integrity; user prompts for filenames and paths.",
  "flows": "User input prompts lead to recursive calls for new filenames/paths; filesystem checks and file extraction occur before checksum verification; validation functions filter paths; file copying and permission setting follow checksum validation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation; standard validation functions are used; user prompts are typical for installers.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package installation tasks: unpacking zip files, verifying file integrity with MD5, copying files, setting permissions, and validating paths. It uses user input for overwriting or renaming files, which is typical but could be misused if inputs are malicious. Validation functions like IsValidInstallPath mitigate path traversal risks. No network activity, code obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The checksum verification ensures file integrity, not security bypass. The code structure is straightforward, with no hidden or malicious logic. Overall, the operations are consistent with a legitimate installer, and no indicators of malicious behavior are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured package installer performing expected tasks without malicious intent. It uses standard validation and checksum procedures, with user prompts handled securely. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The low risk score (0.2) is appropriate given the context, and malware/obfuscation scores remain at zero.",
