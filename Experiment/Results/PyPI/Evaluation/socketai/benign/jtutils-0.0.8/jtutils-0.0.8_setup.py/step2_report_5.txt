  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The provided code is a straightforward `setup.py` script using `setuptools`. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and distribution details.\n   - There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, external data reads, or obfuscated sections.\n   - The dependencies (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `selenium`) are common web-related libraries, not inherently malicious.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**:\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as a standard, benign setup script.\n   - No report claims or implies any suspicious behavior, code anomalies, or malicious intent.\n   - The assessments are consistent and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The confidence level is 1, which is justified due to the clear, standard nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - Since the code is static, simple, and adheres to standard packaging practices, there's no reason to suspect malware or obfuscation.\n   - The dependencies are common and not suspicious.\n   - No claims or evidence of malicious intent are present.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - If the package were to execute code upon installation or runtime, that could introduce risks, but this script does not.\n   - The repository URL and versioning are standard.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a typical, benign Python setup script with no security issues or malicious behavior. The reports are consistent and accurate. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis above, confirming the code's safety and benign nature.",
