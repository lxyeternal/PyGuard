  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'jtutils' Python library.",
  "sources": "User-provided setup parameters and metadata; no external input sources or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "Installation dependencies listed in 'install_requires', no untrusted data flows or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; dependencies are predefined and static.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code is a standard setup script with minimal complexity.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setuptools setup configuration, specifying package info and dependencies. There are no dynamic or suspicious code constructs, no obfuscated parts, and no external data handling that could indicate malicious intent. The dependencies listed ('requests', 'beautifulsoup4', 'selenium') are common web-related libraries, with no signs of malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears benign and standard for packaging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The risk level is minimal.",
