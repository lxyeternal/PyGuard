  "flows": "N/A (no data flow or execution flow to untrusted data).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard setup script with typical package metadata and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata such as name, version, description, author, dependencies, and URL. It does not include any code execution, input handling, or dynamic behaviors. All dependencies are standard and commonly used; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines metadata and dependencies for package distribution.",
