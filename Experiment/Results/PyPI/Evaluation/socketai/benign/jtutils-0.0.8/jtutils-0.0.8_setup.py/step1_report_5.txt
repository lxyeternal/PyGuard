{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'jtutils'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata from the setup() function call, including package information and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user input, or external data handling present that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard package setup script with no suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with static parameters defining package metadata and dependencies. No external inputs, environment variables, or dynamic code execution are present. The dependencies listed are common Python packages ('requests', 'beautifulsoup4', 'selenium') used for web requests, parsing, and browser automation. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or malicious behavior. The script is straightforward and adheres to typical Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply specifies package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious logic.",
