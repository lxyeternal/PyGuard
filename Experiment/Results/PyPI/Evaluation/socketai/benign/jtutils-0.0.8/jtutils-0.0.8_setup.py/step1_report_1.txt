  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'jtutils'. It specifies metadata, dependencies, and package details for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from static strings defining package metadata and dependencies. No external data sources or user inputs are read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions, such as network connections or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations. The script purely provides package metadata and dependencies without executing external or untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code follows standard Python packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and distribution details. It includes no dynamic code, no code execution, and no handling of user input or external data. All information is static and typical for Python package setup files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. It merely defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
