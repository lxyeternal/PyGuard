  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the 'jtutils' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static strings and lists defining package name, version, author info, URL, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed or used in the code.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is static and declarative, with no data flow or execution beyond package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, standard, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools to specify package details and dependencies. It contains only static data, with no dynamic code, user input, or external data handling. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The dependencies are common web-related libraries, not suspicious. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. No logical flaws or assumptions are present. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are accurate and justified. All reports are consistent and correctly assess the code as safe.",
