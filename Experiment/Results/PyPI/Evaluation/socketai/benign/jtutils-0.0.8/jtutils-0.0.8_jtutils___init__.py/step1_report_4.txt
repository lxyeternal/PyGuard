  "purpose": "Import all functions and variables from the local module 'jtutils'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package/module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in this line; potential use depends on subsequent code that uses imported items.",
  "flows": "Import source flows into the current namespace; no data flows are evident in this single line.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*') can hide imported symbols, potentially including malicious or unintended functions or variables, which is considered a poor practice and may be used to conceal malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement using a wildcard, which imports all symbols from the 'jtutils' module in the same package. This practice can be suspicious because it can introduce unwanted or malicious functions without explicit declaration. Without additional context or code, it's not possible to determine if the imported module is malicious, but the use of wildcard import warrants caution due to obscurity and potential for malicious hiding.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and standard but uses a wildcard import, which is generally discouraged due to potential security risks and obscurity. No direct malicious behavior is observable in this line alone, but it warrants further review of the 'jtutils' module and subsequent code.",
