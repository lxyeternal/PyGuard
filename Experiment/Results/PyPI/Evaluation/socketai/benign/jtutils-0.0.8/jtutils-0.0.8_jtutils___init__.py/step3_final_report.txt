  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local module 'jtutils' within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no additional data sources are evident in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code fragment; it only imports symbols.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution flows are observable from this line alone.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import with wildcard ('import *') which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious functions within 'jtutils'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import with a wildcard, which is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution and obscurity. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident solely from this line. The risk associated with this pattern depends on the contents of 'jtutils', which are not provided. The malware score remains at 0, as there is no direct evidence of malicious code. The security risk score is low (around 0.2), acknowledging that wildcard imports can hide malicious functions if the module is compromised. Confidence in this assessment is moderate (around 0.4), given the limited context. The practice of wildcard import itself is a code quality concern but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement alone does not demonstrate malicious activity or significant security risks. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious functions if 'jtutils' is compromised. Further review of the 'jtutils' module is necessary to assess potential threats. Based solely on this snippet, the code is benign, with no evidence of obfuscation or malware.",
