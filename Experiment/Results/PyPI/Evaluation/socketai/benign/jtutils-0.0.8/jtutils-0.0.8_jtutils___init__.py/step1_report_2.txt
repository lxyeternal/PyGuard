  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the module 'jtutils' within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from .jtutils, which may load code or data at runtime.",
  "sinks": "Potentially none directly from this line; subsequent use of imported functions could be sinks.",
  "flows": "Data or control flow depends on how imported functions are used later; none shown here.",
  "anomalies": "Single-line import; no anomalies observed in this statement alone.",
  "analysis": "This code only contains an import statement using relative import syntax. Without additional context or subsequent code, it does not execute any logic nor invoke external data. The import could be benign or malicious depending on the contents of 'jtutils'. Since only the import statement is provided, it is insufficient to determine malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident at this point.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this single import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. However, the imported module 'jtutils' could contain malicious code, but that cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.",
