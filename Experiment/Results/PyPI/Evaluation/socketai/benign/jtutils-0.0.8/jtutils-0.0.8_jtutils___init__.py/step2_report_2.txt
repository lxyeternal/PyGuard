  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports concern a single line: `from .jtutils import *`\n- The main concerns revolve around the use of wildcard imports (`import *`) and relative imports.\n- None of the reports provide evidence of malicious code directly within this line.\n- The potential security risk hinges on whether `jtutils` is malicious or compromised, which cannot be determined from this snippet alone.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, indicating no known malicious activity detected in this line.\n- The confidence levels vary but are generally moderate to high (0.3 to 0.8), reflecting cautious but not definitive suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify the code as an import statement.\n- **Malicious code:** No evidence of malicious code is present in this snippet.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is evident.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** The use of `import *` and relative import practices are flagged as poor practice but not inherently malicious.\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning issues:\n- The reports correctly note that the import itself does not perform malicious actions but can be a vector if `jtutils` is malicious.\n- The conclusion in each report appropriately states that, based solely on this line, no malicious activity can be confirmed.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher (0.2 to 0.3) due to the potential for hidden malicious code in `jtutils`.\n- **Confidence:** Varies but generally reasonable.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The use of `import *` and relative imports is discouraged but not malicious.\n- The actual risk depends on the content of `jtutils`, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the provided reports and analysis:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to potential for malicious module, but no evidence here)\n\n**If I were to assign my own scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malware)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (possible risk if `jtutils` is malicious, but unconfirmed)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent and cautious, correctly highlighting that the line itself is benign but warrants review of the `jtutils` module. No evidence suggests malicious activity or obfuscation. The main concern is the practice of wildcard imports, which can hide malicious functions if present.\n\n**Final note:** To fully assess the security risk, one would need to review the contents of `jtutils`. The current code snippet alone does not justify higher malware or obfuscation scores.",
