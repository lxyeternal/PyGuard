  "conclusion": "The import statement alone does not demonstrate malicious activity or significant security risks. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious functions if 'jtutils' is compromised. Further review of the 'jtutils' module is necessary to assess potential threats. Based solely on this snippet, the code is benign, with no evidence of obfuscation or malware."
