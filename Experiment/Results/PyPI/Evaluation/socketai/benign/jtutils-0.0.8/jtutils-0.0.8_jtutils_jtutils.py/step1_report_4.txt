  "purpose": "Utility functions and helpers for web scraping, data processing, system interaction, and command execution.",
  "sources": "Input reading from sys.stdin, file reading, environment variables, web requests, user input, and command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Web content fetching, subprocess command execution, web driver interactions, and potential file operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (stdin, files, web pages) through processing functions, with some data sent over subprocesses or web drivers, and user input for prompts.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of dynamic web scraping with Selenium and requests without evident restrictions; no explicit hardcoded credentials or backdoors; some functions like 'rand()' generate non-cryptographically secure random numbers; commented-out code does not contain malicious logic; no evident obfuscated code or malicious intents are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a collection of utility functions for file handling, date conversions, web scraping, subprocess management, and command-line processing. It uses standard libraries and common third-party modules like selenium, requests, pandas, and bs4. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Functions for web scraping and browser automation are typical in data gathering scripts, with no evidence they are used maliciously here. The 'rand()' function uses insecure random, but this is a benign utility, not malicious. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, no network communications to suspicious domains, and no obfuscated code are present. The code appears to serve legitimate purposes as a toolkit for data processing and web interactions. Overall, there are no signs of malware or malicious intent in this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility library for data handling, web scraping, and system interactions with no malicious behavior detected. It contains standard functions and no indicators of security risks or malware. The overall security risk is low.",
