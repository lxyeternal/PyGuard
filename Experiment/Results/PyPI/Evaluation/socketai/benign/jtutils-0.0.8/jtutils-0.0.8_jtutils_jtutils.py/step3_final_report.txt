{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for date conversions, web scraping, subprocess management, and command-line interactions. It is intended for general-purpose scripting and automation tasks.",
  "sources": "File input/output operations, environment variables, user input prompts, web requests, subprocess command executions, and data parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess commands executed with shell=True, web page source code, and user input prompts that could be exploited if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input data from files, environment variables, or user prompts flow into subprocess commands or web requests; potential untrusted data may reach subprocess execution or network requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.Popen with shell=True without input sanitization; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; standard library usage with no malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of utility functions for date handling, web scraping, subprocess execution, and user interaction. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The main security concern is the use of subprocess.Popen with shell=True, which can lead to command injection if inputs are not sanitized. Web scraping and date functions are standard and do not introduce security risks. The code is clear and well-structured, with no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility library with no evidence of malicious intent. The primary security consideration is cautious use of subprocess commands with untrusted inputs. Overall, the security risk is low, with a score around 0.3 due to potential misuse, but no active malicious behavior.",
