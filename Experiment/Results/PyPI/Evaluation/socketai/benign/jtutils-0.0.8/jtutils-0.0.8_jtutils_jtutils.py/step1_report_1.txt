{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for date conversions, web scraping, process management, and command execution, likely intended for automation or data processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads data from sys.stdin, files via open_py2_py3, web pages through requests and selenium, and command-line arguments through argparse and internal configs.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess for command execution, Selenium WebDriver for browser automation, and network requests via requests; potential untrusted data sources could influence these actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input, files, web pages, or command-line args into processing functions; results may be output to stdout, or through subprocess and web drivers, depending on function.",
  "anomalies": "Some imports occur within functions (e.g., pandas, requests, bs4) which is acceptable, not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or secret keys are visible. Functions such as run_js, open_driver, and run involve external interactions but are implemented securely. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden malicious behaviors detected. The usage of subprocess and selenium could be misused if supplied with malicious commands or URLs, but this code appears generic and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code predominantly offers utility functions for date manipulation, web scraping, command execution, and process control. It uses external modules responsibly, with no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The subprocess and selenium components are standard for automation but could be risky if user-controlled inputs are passed unchecked; however, the code as-is does not demonstrate such behavior. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious network activity are evident. Overall, the code appears to be a collection of legitimate utility functions, with no malicious or sabotage intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a utility library for data processing, web interaction, and command execution. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are present. It appears safe for use in standard applications, assuming inputs are validated externally. The overall security risk is low.",
