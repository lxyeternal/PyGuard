  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility library for date conversions, web scraping, subprocess execution, and command-line parsing. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The overall security risk is low (0.2).\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the conclusion; no malicious activity.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation evident.\n  - **Risk Score:** 0.2 — reasonable for utility code with minimal external risks.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, with emphasis on potential command injection via `run()` function using `shell=True`. No malicious payloads, but the use of `shell=True` without sanitization is a concern. Malware score is 0, but security risk is 0.3.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Malware Score:** 0 — correct, no malware detected.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n  - **Risk Score:** 0.3 — reflects potential command injection risk due to `shell=True`.\n\n**Justification for risk score:** The main concern is the use of `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=True` without input sanitization, which could be exploited if external inputs are passed unchecked. This is a standard security concern, not an indication of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for web scraping, date handling, subprocess, with no malicious behavior. The use of `shell=True` in `run()` is noted but deemed acceptable given context. Malware score is 0.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 — no malware.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.\n  - **Risk:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to subprocess usage.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, with no malicious intent. No obfuscation or malware. The only concern is `run()` with `shell=True`, which is standard but could be risky if misused.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Malware:** 0.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.\n  - **Risk:** 0.2 — consistent with the potential for command injection if inputs are untrusted.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions with no malicious behavior. The main concern is `run()` with `shell=True` and potential for command injection if inputs are not sanitized.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Malware:** 0.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.\n  - **Risk:** 0.3 — reflects the inherent risk in executing shell commands with unvalidated inputs.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious code are present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but generally acknowledging the security concern with `run()` and `shell=True`. The scores of 0.2 to 0.3 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Given the use of `shell=True` in subprocess calls, a conservative but reasonable estimate would be **0.2** to **0.3**. Since the code does not sanitize inputs, and this is a common security concern, I suggest **0.3** as a cautious but justified risk score.\n\n---\n\n### **Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0.3** |\n\nThis reflects a benign codebase with standard utility functions, with a known and manageable security concern related to subprocess command execution.",
