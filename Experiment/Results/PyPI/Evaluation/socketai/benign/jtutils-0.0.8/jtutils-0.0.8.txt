      "conclusion": "The import statement alone does not demonstrate malicious activity or significant security risks. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious functions if 'jtutils' is compromised. Further review of the 'jtutils' module is necessary to assess potential threats. Based solely on this snippet, the code is benign, with no evidence of obfuscation or malware."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign date utility with some anomalies that appear to be incomplete or leftover code fragments. There is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The scores should reflect low malware likelihood (0), low obfuscation (0.2), and low security risk (0.2). The anomalies should be addressed for clarity and safety, but overall, the code is safe."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility library with no evidence of malicious intent. The primary security consideration is cautious use of subprocess commands with untrusted inputs. Overall, the security risk is low, with a score around 0.3 due to potential misuse, but no active malicious behavior."
