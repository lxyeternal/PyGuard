  "purpose": "The script is a helper CLI tool to connect to an ESPHome device and stream logs.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for address, port, password, noise_psk; asyncio network connections via APIClient; incoming log messages.",
  "sinks": "Decoding of message bytes to text, printing logs to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input args -> APIClient connection -> receiving SubscribeLogsResponse messages -> decoding message -> printing log.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no suspicious data handling; no obfuscated code. Usage of optional environment variables or network data is standard for such tools.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a network connection to an ESPHome device using provided command-line parameters. It listens for logs and prints them in formatted timestamps. No hardcoded secrets, no network data exfiltration, and no suspicious code flows are present. The code is straightforward, relying on user-provided parameters for network credentials. It does not include any malware-like behavior such as unauthorized data exfiltration, system modifications, or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions as a benign log viewer for ESPHome devices. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. No malware or security vulnerabilities are apparent based on the code provided.",
