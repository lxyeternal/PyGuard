  "purpose": "Defines constants, error classes, utility functions, and message mappings for Bluetooth and API communication within ESPHome.",
  "sources": "Static data structures, error classes, and message type mappings; no untrusted input processing.",
  "sinks": "Error handling and message mapping functions; no data leaks or untrusted data influence.",
  "flows": "Error codes and message type identifiers mapped to internal classes and human-readable strings; no external data flow affecting system behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is infrastructure for protocol communication, error handling, and message serialization. It contains static mappings, error class definitions, and utility functions. No dynamic code execution, no data exfiltration, and no backdoors are present. The high confidence (close to 1) in benign nature is justified. The absence of obfuscation and malicious behavior aligns with the code's purpose as infrastructure support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard protocol infrastructure with no malicious intent, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The scores in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores should be 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1), reflecting the benign, static nature of the code.",
