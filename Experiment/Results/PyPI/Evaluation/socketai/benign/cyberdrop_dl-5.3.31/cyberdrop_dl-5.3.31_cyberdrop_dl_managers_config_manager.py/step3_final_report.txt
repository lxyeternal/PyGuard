  "purpose": "Configuration management: loading, verifying, creating, updating, and deleting YAML config files and directories.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads/writes, cache manager, args manager, YAML files, directory paths.",
  "sinks": "YAML files (load/save), directory deletion (`shutil.rmtree`), cache updates.",
  "flows": "Config data flows from filesystem or args into in-memory dicts, then back to files or directories; deletion of configs via directory removal.",
  "anomalies": "Uses directory deletion without explicit input validation; no secrets or obfuscation; no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration management tasks with safe file handling practices. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Directory deletion is a potential risk if external input influences directory paths, but current implementation manages paths internally or via controlled args. No suspicious network activity or hardcoded secrets. The overall logic is straightforward and aligns with typical config handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, considering directory deletion operations that could pose risks if inputs are malicious. Maintaining the current scores is justified, but operational caution should include input validation to mitigate potential misuse.",
