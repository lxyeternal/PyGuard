The primary concern is YAML deserialization safety; switching to `yaml.safe_load()` would further reduce risk. Current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are appropriate, with the understanding that the code is secure for trusted data environments."

The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, considering directory deletion operations that could pose risks if inputs are malicious. Maintaining the current scores is justified, but operational caution should include input validation to mitigate potential misuse."

It handles user inputs cautiously but should validate paths downstream. Scores are appropriately low, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a minimal risk score around 0.1 reflecting potential misuse if inputs are not validated elsewhere."
