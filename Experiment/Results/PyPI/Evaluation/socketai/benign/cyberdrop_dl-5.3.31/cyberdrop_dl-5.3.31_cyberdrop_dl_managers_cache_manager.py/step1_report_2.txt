  "purpose": "Manage caching by saving and loading data to/from YAML files for the cyberdrop_dl project.",
  "sources": "User-supplied cache file path, data passed to save method",
  "sinks": "File writes to cache file, YAML dump operation",
  "flows": "save() method writes data to YAML file, load() method reads data from YAML file",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; use of YAML for cache management is standard, no hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code provides a cache management system that reads and writes a dictionary to a YAML file. The '_save_yaml' and '_load_yaml' functions handle file I/O securely with context managers. No user input directly influences the cache file path within this code snippet, assuming the path is set appropriately elsewhere. The code uses 'Path' objects for file handling, which is safe. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or code injection. The use of 'yaml.load' with 'FullLoader' is standard for safe YAML parsing. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward cache system with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cache management implementation with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It safely reads and writes cache data using YAML files, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
