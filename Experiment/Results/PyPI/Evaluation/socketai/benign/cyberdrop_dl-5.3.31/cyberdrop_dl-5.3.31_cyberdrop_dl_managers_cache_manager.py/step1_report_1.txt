  "purpose": "Manage caching by reading and writing YAML files for a Manager component",
  "sources": "File system (reading/writing YAML files), configuration data, class instantiation",
  "sinks": "File operations (reading/writing YAML files)",
  "flows": "Loading cache data from file to memory; saving data from memory to file; deleting cache entries and updating file",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to save and load YAML files, and a CacheManager class that handles cache data via a file. The methods perform standard file and YAML operations. There are no signs of data leakage, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The flow is straightforward, with typical read/write patterns. No external network access or suspicious data handling is evident. The code structure is conventional and secure, assuming external dependencies (like 'yaml') are trustworthy.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a basic cache management system using YAML files. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks based on the provided code. The logic is standard and secure for its purpose.",
