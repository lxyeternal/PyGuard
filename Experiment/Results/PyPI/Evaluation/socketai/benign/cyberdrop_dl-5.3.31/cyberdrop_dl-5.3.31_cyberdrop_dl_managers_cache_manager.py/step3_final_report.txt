  "purpose": "Manage caching via YAML files for persistent storage of configuration or state data.",
  "sources": "File system read/write operations, specifically reading from and writing to the specified cache file.",
  "sinks": "Potential deserialization of YAML content into Python objects, which could be exploited if the YAML data is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Loading YAML data from the cache file into memory, modifying the in-memory cache, then saving back to the file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `yaml.load()` with `FullLoader` instead of `safe_load()`, which, while safer, still can pose risks if the cache file is maliciously crafted or untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple cache management system with standard file I/O and YAML serialization. It uses `yaml.FullLoader`, which mitigates some risks but does not eliminate YAML deserialization vulnerabilities if the cache file is compromised. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The security risk is minimal but slightly elevated due to potential YAML parsing issues, especially if the cache file is untrusted. The malware score is zero, and the obfuscation score is zero, reflecting the straightforward and clear implementation. The risk score should be low, around 0.2, considering the YAML deserialization aspect, but no actual vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe cache management utility with no malicious or obfuscated content. The primary concern is YAML deserialization safety; switching to `yaml.safe_load()` would further reduce risk. Current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are appropriate, with the understanding that the code is secure for trusted data environments.",
