  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe cache management utility with no malicious or obfuscated content. The primary concern is YAML deserialization safety; switching to `yaml.safe_load()` would further reduce risk. Current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are appropriate, with the understanding that the code is secure for trusted data environments."
