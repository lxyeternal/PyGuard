    "Dynamic log level adjustment based on environment variable PYCHARM_HOSTED or configuration settings.",
    "Repeated creation and removal of log handlers inside a continuous loop, which could indicate overly complex or confusing log management but not malicious.",
    "Use of subprocess to clear screen is common but may be misused if manipulated externally, though unlikely here.",
    "No hard-coded credentials or secret keys observed.",
    "No evident obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or misleading variables.",
    "Absence of code that reads sensitive environment variables beyond basic config adjustments."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code manages the application's main workflow, including startup, configuration management, logging, UI display, task orchestration, and cleanup. It dynamically adjusts logging levels, handles multiple configurations, runs download and scraping tasks asynchronously, and manages UI rendering with 'rich'. The subprocess call clears the terminal screen. There are no signs of hidden code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious external communication. The code primarily relies on local configuration, environment variables, and standard subprocess calls without malicious intent. Its structure appears standard for an application of this scope, with no anomalies indicating malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code functions as a standard orchestrator for a download management application. It sets up logging, manages configurations, runs asynchronous tasks, and handles user interface rendering. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The code does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious external communications. Its complexity and dynamic logging adjustments are typical for such applications and do not imply malicious intent.",
