{
  "purpose": "The code manages HTTP sessions with SSL, rate limiting, and response validation for scraping/downloading tasks, including anti-bot measures.",
  "sources": "Response headers (ETag, Content-Type), response URL, response JSON content, response text.",
  "sinks": "Exceptions raised based on headers, response content, or status, which influence control flow and error handling.",
  "flows": "Response headers/content → conditional checks → exceptions or normal return based on status and content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard validation and configuration-driven setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard HTTP session management, response validation, and anti-bot detection without malicious payloads or obfuscation. It raises exceptions for maintenance, resource removal, or anti-bot measures, which are typical in scraping tools. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or covert channels are present. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscation as 0, and security risk as 0.2 due to reliance on external configurations but no inherent vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured HTTP client for scraping/downloading with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
