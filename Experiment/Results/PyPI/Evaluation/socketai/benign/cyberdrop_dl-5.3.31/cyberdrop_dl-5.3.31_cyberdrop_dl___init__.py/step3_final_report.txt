{
  "purpose": "The code declares a version string for a Python package, serving as metadata.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the assignment is isolated and static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions. The code lacks obfuscation, malicious code, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these scores. No logical errors or security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
