  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string value to the __version__ variable, which is a common practice in Python packages to specify version information. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or external data interactions. The simplicity indicates it's a standard version declaration, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
