  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is standard and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident; each correctly states that the code is a straightforward version declaration.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree that there's no malicious behavior, the risk scores (0) are justified.\n   - The code's minimal nature and lack of external interactions mean no elevated risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's actual content.\n   - Their reasoning is sound.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Overall Systematic Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Final Judgment:**\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I agree with the provided assessments. No additional risks or malicious activity are evident.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
