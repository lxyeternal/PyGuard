{
  "purpose": "Define classes for bounds (inclusive/exclusive) and infinity representations for use in other modules, likely for range or interval handling.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading; class definitions and constant instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving external sources; internal object comparisons and method calls within classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code implements standard singleton pattern and special value classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enumeration for bounds, singleton pattern for infinity objects, and methods to compare and represent positive and negative infinity. No external data input, no network communication, and no suspicious operations. The code appears to be a utility module for bounds and infinity handling with standard patterns. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of bounds and infinity representations with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a utility module likely intended for interval or range processing.",
