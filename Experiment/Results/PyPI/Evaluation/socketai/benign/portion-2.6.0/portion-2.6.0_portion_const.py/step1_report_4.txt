{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for bounds and infinities used in mathematical or logical comparisons.",
  "sources": "Importing the enum module, class definitions, and magic methods for comparison and representation.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data input or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily defines static classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides enumeration for bounds (open/closed), singleton pattern for infinities (_PInf, _NInf), and comparison operators for infinities. No data input/output, network operations, or external interactions are present. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation appears to be a standard utility module for mathematical comparisons.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of bounds and infinity representations without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
