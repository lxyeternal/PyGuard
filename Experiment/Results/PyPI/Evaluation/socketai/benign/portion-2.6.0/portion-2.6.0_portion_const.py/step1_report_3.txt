  "purpose": "Defines enumeration for bounds and singleton classes for representing positive and negative infinity with comparison operations.",
  "sources": "import enum; class Bound; classes _Singleton, _PInf, _NInf; variables inf",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no network, file, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly defines classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes enumeration for bounds and singleton classes for positive/negative infinity with comparison operators. No input or output, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. It appears as utility code for mathematical or interval operations, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional and utility-based, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use and contains no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
