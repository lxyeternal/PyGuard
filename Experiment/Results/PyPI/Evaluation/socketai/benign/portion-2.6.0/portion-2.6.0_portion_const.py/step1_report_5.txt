{
  "purpose": "Defines enumerations for boundary types and singleton classes for representing positive and negative infinity with comparison behaviors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, enum values, special method implementations (__lt__, __le__, __gt__, __ge__, __eq__, __hash__, __repr__, __neg__)",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data input/output, network communication, or external resource access",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code strictly defines classes and constants without external data handling",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; no dynamic execution or external calls",
  "analysis": "The code provides an enumeration for boundary types and singleton classes to represent positive and negative infinity, with comparison operators overridden for logical behavior. It does not include any input/output, network operations, or external interactions. The code appears well-structured and intended for use as part of a larger library or application that requires boundary and infinity representations. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of boundary types and infinity representations, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe and appears to be a utility module for broader use.",
