  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'portion' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; no external input data sources; no dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or untrusted data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only reads a file for metadata and passes static data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. It imports necessary modules, reads a README file for the long description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. There are no user inputs, no external data processing, no code execution beyond static file reading, and no suspicious or malicious logic. The dependencies listed are common and trustworthy. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It does not contain malicious code, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
