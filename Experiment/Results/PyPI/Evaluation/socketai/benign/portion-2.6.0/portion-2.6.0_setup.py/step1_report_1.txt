  "purpose": "This script configures the setup and installation parameters for the 'portion' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data processing beyond package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only involves static configuration and file reading without data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard setup procedures without suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, reads a local markdown file for long description, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts. No dynamic code execution, network access, or sensitive data handling occurs. The dependencies are version-locked but safe, and no unusual or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
