  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library, reading README.md for long description and defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file; static calls to setuptools.setup() with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network calls, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md as input, static setup configuration; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static file reading and setup invocation. No dynamic code, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. All operations are static and standard. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate a benign package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, with high confidence.",
