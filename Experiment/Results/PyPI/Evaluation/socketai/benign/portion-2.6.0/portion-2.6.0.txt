      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for dynamic API creation, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe, well-structured, and free of malware or obfuscation. The scores should be malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility module for interval parsing and serialization. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the reliance on user-supplied 'conv' functions, which could be malicious if malicious functions are provided externally, but this is a known and acceptable pattern in such utilities. Overall, the code is safe, with a low security risk primarily due to external 'conv' functions."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of an interval dictionary with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and there are no active vulnerabilities or malicious patterns. The supply chain security posture of this dependency is very low risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard interval utility module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk reflects the potential for misuse if untrusted parameters are provided, but within this code, no vulnerabilities are evident."

Scores should reflect no malware or obfuscation, with a very low security risk primarily due to the relative path. The current assessments assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate and should be maintained."
