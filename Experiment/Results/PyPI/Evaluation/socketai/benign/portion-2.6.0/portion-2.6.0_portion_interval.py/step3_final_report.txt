{
  "purpose": "This code implements an interval arithmetic library for managing and manipulating mathematical intervals, supporting operations like union, intersection, difference, and merging of intervals.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for interval creation, internal interval data structures, and deprecation warnings.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Internal data flows include interval comparisons, merging, and property computations; no external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious anomalies; code is straightforward with standard interval logic. Presence of deprecation warnings is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of interval arithmetic with clear methods for creating, merging, and manipulating intervals. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling. The deprecation warnings are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The logic is consistent with mathematical interval operations, and no network or file I/O is present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are appropriate and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent interval arithmetic library with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It poses minimal security risk and is safe for use in open-source projects.",
