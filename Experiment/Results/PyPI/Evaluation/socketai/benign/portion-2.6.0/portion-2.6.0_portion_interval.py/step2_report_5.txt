  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects: presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, security risk, and consistency of scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as an interval arithmetic library.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or system modifications are identified.\n- Warnings are related to deprecation, not malicious intent.\n- No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be a well-structured mathematical utility.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n### Malware Score\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, citing no malicious activity, backdoors, or covert channels.\n- Given the code's nature—pure interval arithmetic with no external or dynamic code execution—this seems accurate.\n- No signs of malware, code injection, or malicious payloads.\n\n### Obfuscated Score\n- All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0.\n- The code is clear, well-structured, and lacks obfuscation or code hiding techniques.\n\n### Security Risk Score\n- The scores range from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal concern.\n- The only minor point is the deprecated warnings, which are benign.\n- No external data leaks, network activity, or system manipulation are present.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes\n- The reports do not identify any logical errors or vulnerabilities.\n- The code's operations are standard for interval arithmetic.\n- The deprecated warning in `mergeable` is noted but not a security concern.\n\n### Scores Justification\n- The scores seem reasonable given the code's purpose and analysis.\n- The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (very low, standard mathematical library)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to deprecated warnings, but overall very safe)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a legitimate, well-implemented interval arithmetic library with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this analysis.",
