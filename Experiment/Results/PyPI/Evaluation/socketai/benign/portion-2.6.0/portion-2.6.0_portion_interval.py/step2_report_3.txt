  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as an interval arithmetic library with robust mathematical operations, no external data sources or sinks, and no malicious behavior.\n- They note the presence of deprecation warnings but interpret these as benign.\n- No report indicates obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code snippets.\n- The code does not perform network activity, file I/O, or dynamic code execution.\n- The potential concern about misuse with untrusted data is typical for such libraries, but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** No issues or anomalies in the code logic are reported.\n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports find any malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports confirm the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risks:** Very low, primarily due to the library’s mathematical nature and lack of external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n\n| Aspect | Reported Score | Reasoning | Suggested Adjustment |\n|---------|------------------|--------------|----------------------|\n| Malware | 0 | No malicious activity detected. | **0** (consistent) |\n| Obfuscated | 0 | No obfuscation present. | **0** |\n| Risk | 0.1 - 0.2 | Slightly elevated due to deprecation warnings and potential misuse with untrusted data. | **0.1** — remains low, as no malicious intent is evident. |\n\n### Justification for risk score:\n\n- The code is a mathematical utility with no external data or network activity.\n- The only concern is potential misuse with untrusted input, which is standard for such libraries, but not malicious.\n- The deprecation warnings do not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n\n### Malware score justification:\n\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- The code performs legitimate interval arithmetic.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n**Therefore, the malware score should remain at 0.**\n\n---\n\n### Potential discrepancies or overestimations:\n\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the reports and my analysis, I concur with the overall conclusion that the code is a legitimate, well-implemented interval arithmetic library with no malicious or obfuscated components.**\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is clear, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal risk, mainly due to potential misuse with untrusted data, which is typical and not malicious)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Aspect | Final Score | Justification |\n|---------|--------------|----------------|\n| Malware | 0 | No malicious behavior or payloads detected. |\n| Obfuscated | 0 | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation. |\n| Risk | 0.1 | Slight concern about misuse, but overall very low risk. |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate, and does not warrant higher malware or obfuscation scores. The minimal risk score reflects typical concerns with libraries that process untrusted input but does not indicate malicious intent.",
