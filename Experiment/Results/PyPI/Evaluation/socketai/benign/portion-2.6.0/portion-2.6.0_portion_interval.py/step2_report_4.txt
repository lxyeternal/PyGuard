  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the reasoning provided.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is an interval arithmetic implementation with no external data sources, sinks, or suspicious anomalies. The analysis states the code is mathematically oriented, with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code performs interval operations, uses warnings for deprecation, and does not include any network, file, or dynamic code execution. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is low (0.2). The confidence is high (0.9).\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The assessment appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the mathematical nature, absence of external data sources, and no malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code operates solely on input parameters and internal interval logic. No external communication or malicious patterns are detected. Malware score is 0, risk is minimal (0.1), confidence high (0.95).\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The evaluation is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the interval management logic, with no external data sources or sinks, and no malicious behavior. Warnings are benign.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is aligned with the code's behavior. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Malware score is 0, risk is low (0.1), confidence high (0.95).\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The review is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes that the code reads data from parameters and internal structures, with no external sinks. Mentions deprecation warnings but no malicious intent.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code's operations are mathematical and internal, with no external data leaks or malicious patterns. Malware score is 0, risk is low (0.2), confidence high (0.9).\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The assessment is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing the absence of external data sources, sinks, and malicious behavior. Notes deprecated warnings but no malicious intent.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's functionality. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Malware score is 0, risk is low (0.2), confidence high (0.9).\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a mathematical interval library with no external data sources, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious patterns.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's transparent, mathematical nature.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, as expected.\n\n- **Potential Concerns:** The only minor point is the use of warnings.warn for deprecation, which is standard and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — Very low, consistent with the reports.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to deprecation warnings, but overall very safe)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured interval arithmetic library with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or sabotage. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
