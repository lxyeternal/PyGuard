{
  "purpose": "The code implements an Interval class for managing and manipulating numeric or discrete ranges, including merging, intersecting, and other interval operations.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily read from interval parameters and internal atomic interval structures within class methods and properties.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network, file system, or system commands are present. The code does not process or output untrusted data to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (interval bounds) into internal atomic interval structures, with operations like merging and comparison that process these bounds. No external or untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a deprecated warning in 'mergeable' function and some complex interval logic, but no suspicious or malicious patterns like data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors are present. Usage of warnings.warn() is benign here.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for interval management, with robust handling of interval bounds, merging, and comparisons. No external data sources or sinks indicate malicious intent. The operations are mathematical and structural, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The warnings are standard deprecation notices. No hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or potentially malicious behaviors are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of interval operations with no malicious or sabotage behaviors detected. It primarily manipulates interval data internally and provides methods for interval arithmetic. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks.",
