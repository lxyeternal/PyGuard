{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for creating and iterating over different types of interval objects, primarily for mathematical or data range purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters such as lower and upper bounds, the interval object, step value, and optional base function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit sinks that handle untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities such as data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to instantiate interval objects and to control iteration. The main flow involves reading bounds, optional functions, and parameters to generate values via iteration.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and well-structured, with no signs of unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. The iteration function handles infinity checks properly.",
  "analysis": "The script defines multiple interval creation functions with no external input processing, only parameter passing. The iterate() function builds a lazy iterator over interval values, with customizable step, order, and starting point. There are no external data sources, network calls, or data handling that could lead to malicious behavior. The inclusion of 'operator' and 'partial' is standard for functional operations. The code checks for infinite start values to prevent infinite loops. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign utility module for interval creation and iteration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard Python features and handles parameters securely. The absence of external data handling, network access, or sensitive data processing indicates a very low likelihood of malicious behavior.",
