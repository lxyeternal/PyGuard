{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for creating and iterating over interval objects, such as open, closed, singleton, and empty intervals, as well as an iterator for traversing interval values.",
  "sources": "Parameters for interval bounds (lower, upper, value), which are used internally in functions like 'from_atomic' and in iteration logic.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network operations; data flows are confined within parameter passing and internal function calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (bounds, step, base) flow into interval creation functions and iteration logic; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code segments detected. Usage of standard Python constructs and safe boundary checks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module for interval management, employing safe and standard practices. It handles interval creation with various boundary types, and provides an iteration function that respects interval bounds and supports reverse iteration. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The iteration logic correctly manages boundary conditions and uses safe default functions. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard interval utility module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk reflects the potential for misuse if untrusted parameters are provided, but within this code, no vulnerabilities are evident.",
