{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically creates a Python module with an API based on a provided Interval class, including utility functions and constants.",
  "sources": "Reads data from imported modules and class attributes, including 'interval' parameter and constants from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Creates a new module object and assigns functions and constants to it; no external untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "Uses provided class 'interval' to generate functions and objects, then assigns them to a new module, with no external or network data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The dynamic module creation via importlib appears legitimate and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and project modules, then defines helper functions. The main function 'create_api' generates a new module object, constructs a dictionary of functions and constants using the provided 'interval' class, and injects these into the module. No untrusted input, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The dynamic import and module creation are standard techniques for plugin-like systems. The code does not perform any malicious operations or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a controlled utility for generating dynamic modules based on input classes. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks were found. It appears safe and purposeful, with no suspicious patterns.",
