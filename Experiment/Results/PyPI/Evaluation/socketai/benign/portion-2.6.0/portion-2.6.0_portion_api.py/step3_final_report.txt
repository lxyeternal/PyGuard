{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically creates a Python module with interval-related functions and constants, based on provided class parameters, facilitating flexible API generation.",
  "sources": "The code reads class objects (`interval`, `interval_dict`) passed as parameters, and uses standard library modules (`importlib`, `functools`) for module creation.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs, network operations, or file writes; the code does not process external untrusted sources or data sinks.",
  "flows": "The flow involves using class parameters to define functions and constants, which are then assigned as attributes to a new module object created via importlib, with no external data or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses standard Python techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and local classes, defines a helper for partial functions, and constructs a module object populated with functions and constants derived from parameters. It employs safe, common patterns for dynamic module creation without any external data handling, network activity, or code injection. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The logic is clear, and the approach is controlled and predictable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for dynamic API creation, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe, well-structured, and free of malware or obfuscation. The scores should be malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.",
