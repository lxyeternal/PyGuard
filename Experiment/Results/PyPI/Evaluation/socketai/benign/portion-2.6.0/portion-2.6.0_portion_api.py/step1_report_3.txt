{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically creates a Python module with an API related to interval management, including functions and constants for interval operations and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads no external inputs directly; imports standard and local modules, and uses function parameters and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Defines functions and creates a module object; no direct data sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows detected; primarily constructs objects and module attributes based on parameters and imported classes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of dynamic module creation via importlib appears legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library modules for dynamic module creation and function wrapping. It defines utility functions and a core 'create_api' function that generates a module object with interval-related functions and constants. No input from untrusted sources or network activity is evident. It relies on class attributes and parameters, with no embedded or obfuscated malicious behavior. All functions and imports serve legitimate purposes in configuring a dynamic API module.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for dynamically creating a module with interval management capabilities. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are observed. It is a safe and controlled code pattern for module generation.",
