  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a utility for dynamically creating modules with interval-related functions and constants.\n- They consistently note the use of standard Python libraries (functools, importlib) and local modules.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- The code relies on safe, well-understood techniques like dynamic module creation and partial function binding.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or file operations are present.\n- The overall confidence in the safety of the code is high (mostly 1.0, except one report at 0.95).\n- Malware scores are consistently zero across all reports.\n- Security risks are minimal or zero, with some minor mentions of potential concerns due to dynamic module creation, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Confirmations & Discrepancies:**\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- The use of importlib for module creation is standard for plugin-like systems.\n- No evidence of data leaks, network activity, or code injection.\n- The reports' reasoning is consistent and sound.\n\n**Scores & Justifications:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; justified as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 or very close; no security vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns detected.\n\n**Potential Overestimations:**\n- One report assigns a security risk of 0.1, likely due to the dynamic module creation pattern. While dynamic code can sometimes be risky, in this context, it appears controlled and safe.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard utility for dynamic module creation based on class parameters.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**My Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (or 0.1 if conservative, but I prefer 0 given the evidence)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. It uses common Python techniques appropriately, with no indications of security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate; the code is benign.\n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n- I concur with the assessments: no malware, no obfuscation, minimal to no security risk.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's safety and legitimacy.",
