{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically creates a Python module with an API for interval operations, based on provided interval classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (functools, importlib) and local modules (.const, .func, .io, .dict); uses input parameters such as 'interval' and 'interval_dict'.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic module creation and assignment of functions to the module object; no untrusted data sinks or network activities observed.",
  "flows": "The function creates a new module object, populates it with functions and constants, and returns it; no external data flow to untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code appears to follow standard Python dynamic module creation practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and local modules, defines helper functions (partial, create_api), and dynamically constructs a module with interval-related functions and constants. The create_api function builds a module name, creates a new class if interval_dict is not provided, then populates a module object with predefined functions and constants. All steps are straightforward and use safe, well-understood Python techniques. There are no network operations, no eval/exec calls, and no suspicious data handling. The dynamic module creation is a common pattern and does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for dynamic API creation based on interval classes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on standard Python features to generate modules and assign functions and constants. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
