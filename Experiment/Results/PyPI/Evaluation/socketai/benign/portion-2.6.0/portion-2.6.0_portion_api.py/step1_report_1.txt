{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically creates a module with an API similar to 'portion', configuring it with a specific Interval subclass and related components.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (functools, importlib, importlib.util, importlib.machinery), and local module imports (.const, .func, .io, .dict). No user input or external data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "The code dynamically creates a module and assigns attributes; no sinks such as system commands, network connections, or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules, defining helper functions, and creating a module object with assigned attributes, without external data or untrusted inputs affecting critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. The dynamic module creation via importlib is standard and safe in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and local modules, defines a 'partial' helper combining functools features, and a 'create_api' function that generates a new module with specific attributes and functions. The module creation uses importlib's utilities in a typical manner. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, file manipulation, or code injection. The dynamic module generation is controlled and based solely on provided class objects, with no user input or untrusted data influencing the process.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for creating modules dynamically based on class parameters. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and uses standard Python features responsibly. There are no indications of malware or security risks.",
