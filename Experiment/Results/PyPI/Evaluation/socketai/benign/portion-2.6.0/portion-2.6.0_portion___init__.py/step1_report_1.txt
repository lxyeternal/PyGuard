{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports a set of functions, constants, and classes related to interval operations and API creation, primarily for use in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.api, .const, .interval, .func, .io, .dict); constants and variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks; no untrusted data processing, network operations, or system commands present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from external untrusted sources to critical functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out initialization function (_init) which hints at dynamic API creation, but it is inactive. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of import statements, constant definitions, and an __all__ list to specify module exports. There is no handling of user input, environment variables, or network operations. The commented-out _init function indicates an optional dynamic API setup but is currently inactive and does not execute. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. Usage of internal modules and constants appears legitimate for a typical Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module setup for a Python package, focusing on interval operations and API exports. No malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks are evident.",
