{
  "purpose": "This module imports and exposes various functions, constants, and classes related to intervals and data serialization/deserialization, likely as part of a larger library for interval arithmetic or data handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.api, .const, .interval, .func, .io, .dict); no direct user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data can lead to data leaks or security effects; the code mainly defines constants and imports functions/classes.",
  "flows": "The code does not contain explicit data flow paths; the commented-out function hints at dynamic API creation but is inactive.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected; commented-out code is benign and standard for backward compatibility management.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up constants, imports, and exports functions/classes for external use. No user input, network communication, or data processing occurs here. The commented-out '_init' function, which dynamically creates an API and modifies module attributes, could potentially be risky if activated, but as it stands, it is inert and does not pose a security threat. The active code appears safe, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious logic. There are no hardcoded credentials, external data leaks, or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for an interval-related library, with no malicious or suspicious behavior present. The commented dynamic API creation could be risky if enabled, but currently, it is inactive and harmless.",
