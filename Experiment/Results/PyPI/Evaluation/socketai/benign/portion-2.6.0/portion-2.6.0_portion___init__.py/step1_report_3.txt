{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports and exports various functions, constants, and classes related to interval operations and API creation.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .api, .const, .interval, .func, .io, .dict; No external or user input sources.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no use of untrusted data, network operations, or sensitive information handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from sources to sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out init function that attempts to dynamically create and assign an API object, but it's inactive. No suspicious or unusual code structures or hidden behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module exports and constants, with straightforward import/export statements. The commented code suggests an optional dynamic API creation approach, but it is inactive and appears to be a standard pattern for maintaining backward compatibility. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code obfuscation. The code is simple, clean, and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is well-structured, and all components are benign.",
