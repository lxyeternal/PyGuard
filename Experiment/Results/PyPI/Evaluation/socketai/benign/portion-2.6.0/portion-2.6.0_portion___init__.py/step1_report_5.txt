{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports functions, constants, and classes related to interval management, API creation, and data serialization.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and functions from internal packages, and defines constants and a list of exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; all operations are static or module-internal.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily sets up API exports and constants.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of commented-out code that dynamically creates and assigns API functions; no active dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules, sets up exports, and defines constants. The commented-out '_init' function indicates a mechanism for dynamic API setup, but it is inactive. No functions process user input, environment variables, or perform network operations. No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a standard module setup with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup module for a larger library, primarily involved in defining and exporting functions and constants. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
