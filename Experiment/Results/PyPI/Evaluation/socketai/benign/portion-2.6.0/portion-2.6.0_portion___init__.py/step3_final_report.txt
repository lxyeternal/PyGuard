{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module setup for interval-related operations, importing various components and defining constants for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from internal module imports and constants; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to leaks or effects, as the code does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines constants and exports functions/classes; no data flows from sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is a commented-out '_init()' function intended for dynamic API creation, which is inactive and does not affect current behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing internal modules and defining constants. The commented-out '_init()' suggests a mechanism for dynamic API setup but is inactive, posing no current risk. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure patterns are detected. The code is static and benign, with no external data handling or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup with no active malicious or suspicious behavior. The only potential concern is the commented-out '_init()' function, which could pose a risk if activated, but as it stands, it is inert. The overall security posture is very low risk.",
