  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the code as an implementation of an interval mapping data structure, relying on trusted external classes, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code performs standard interval operations, and no suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable given the benign nature but acknowledging some inherent complexity.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard data structure behavior, no network or external system calls, and no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code appears legitimate, and no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns; the code seems safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, describes the code as a standard interval dictionary with typical operations, no malicious activity, and potential data exposure via `as_dict`.\n- **Assessment:** The potential data leak through `as_dict` is a feature, not malicious. No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the code as a legitimate interval-based dictionary, with no signs of malicious behavior, network activity, or sabotage.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code relies on standard libraries and performs expected operations.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, describing a standard interval data structure with no external interactions or malicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The logic and reasoning are sound. No suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code does not contain any malicious patterns—no network calls, code injection, or backdoors. This is consistent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard idioms. No obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in all reports, reflecting the complexity and potential for misuse if inputs are untrusted, but overall very low.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious intent or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and understandable.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — minor risk due to potential misuse of untrusted inputs, but overall low.\n\n**Note:** The code relies on external trusted libraries (`sortedcontainers`, `Interval`, `Bound`) and performs standard interval operations. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0.2** |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
