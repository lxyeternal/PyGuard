  "purpose": "An interval mapping data structure that associates intervals or single values with data, supporting range queries and modifications.",
  "sources": "Reads from class attributes, methods like __getitem__, update, and internal storage (_storage).",
  "sinks": "No external system calls, network activity, or file operations detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows within the class methods, such as __getitem__, __setitem__, update, and internal storage manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden code. External dependencies are standard and trusted.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard interval dictionary relying on trusted external libraries (sortedcontainers, Interval, Bound). It performs typical interval operations, including overlaps, merging, and range queries. No external system interactions, network calls, or malicious payloads are present. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or backdoors. The low security risk score (0.2) reflects minimal concern, primarily about potential data exposure via methods like as_dict(), but this is a feature, not malicious. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of an interval dictionary with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and there are no active vulnerabilities or malicious patterns. The supply chain security posture of this dependency is very low risk.",
