  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pylru' Python package, providing package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.rst' to obtain long_description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data or input can lead to data leak or execution effects.",
  "flows": "Reads the content of 'README.rst' file to assign as long_description during package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() to read a README file without any validation or sanitization; however, this is standard practice in setup scripts. No suspicious or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata, which is typical for Python packages. It reads the long_description from a file, which is standard. There are no dynamic code executions, no use of environment variables, no network connections, and no malicious code indicators. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code structure and content are straightforward and align with common setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures package metadata for distribution.",
