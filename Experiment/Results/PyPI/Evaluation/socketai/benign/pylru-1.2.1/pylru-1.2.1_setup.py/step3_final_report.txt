  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and read long description from README.rst.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file via open() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or code execution.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.rst' from disk, no data flow to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without error handling; no malicious or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python module. It imports setuptools, calls setup() with metadata, and reads a README file. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The use of open() without error handling is typical in setup scripts and does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
