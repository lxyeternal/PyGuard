{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pylru' Python package, used to define package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the package metadata from hardcoded strings and reading the long description from 'README.rst' file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static strings and the 'README.rst' file into the setup configuration; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is a standard setup script. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setuptools.setup()' with package metadata including name, version, author info, URL, classifiers, and description. The long_description reads from a local file 'README.rst'. All used data appears to be static and intended for package configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It simply specifies package metadata for distribution.",
