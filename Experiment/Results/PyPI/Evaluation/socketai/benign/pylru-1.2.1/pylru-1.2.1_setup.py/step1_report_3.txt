  "sources": "Reads package metadata, README.rst content, and standard setup parameters",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no data leaks or harmful actions",
  "flows": "Reads README file content, uses it as long_description during setup",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard packaging code with no suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to configure package metadata such as name, version, author info, URL, classifiers, and description. It reads the README.rst file to populate long_description. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package setup; no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious instructions observed. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign setup script for packaging a Python library. It follows standard practices with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
