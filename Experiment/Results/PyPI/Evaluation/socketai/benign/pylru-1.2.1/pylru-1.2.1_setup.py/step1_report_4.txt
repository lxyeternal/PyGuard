  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'pylru' Python module",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from hardcoded strings and reads README.rst file for long description",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows present",
  "flows": "No external data flows; data is static or file-based for package setup",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; standard setuptools setup routine",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata including name, version, modules, description, author info, URL, classifiers, and long description read from a file. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present. It appears to be a straightforward package setup script with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a normal, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
