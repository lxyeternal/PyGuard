      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom Sphinx builders for serializing build context and output data. No signs of malware, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of 'pickle' is limited to dumping data, which minimizes associated risks in this context. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero."

      "conclusion": "The reports are generally accurate and consistent with their descriptions. The high security risk in Report 5 is justified by the unsafe command execution pattern, though no malware is present. Scores across all reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and risk scores reflecting the potential severity of vulnerabilities. No further adjustments are necessary."
