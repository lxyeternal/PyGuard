{
  "purpose": "Defines a pytest fixture that resolves a directory path relative to the current file for use in tests.",
  "sources": "The code reads the special variable __file__ to determine the current script's location.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data beyond path resolution.",
  "flows": "Source (__file__) -> Path construction in rootdir() -> Return of Path object",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard libraries and constructs with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for type hints, pathlib.Path for path operations, and pytest for testing. It defines a fixture 'rootdir' that returns a Path object pointing to a 'roots' directory relative to the current file. The code is minimal, standard for test setup, with no external data input, network activity, or malicious constructs. No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The use of __file__ is typical in such contexts and does not indicate malicious intent. The code's simplicity and purpose are clear, and it poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pytest fixture setup for directory path resolution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all correctly set to 0.",
