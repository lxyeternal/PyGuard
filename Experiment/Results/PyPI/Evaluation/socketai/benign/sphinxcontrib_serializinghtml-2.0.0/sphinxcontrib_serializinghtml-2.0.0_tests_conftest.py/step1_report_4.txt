  "purpose": "Set up test fixtures and import necessary modules for pytest testing framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own file (__file__) to determine the root directory path.",
  "sinks": "None observed that would lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The rootdir fixture uses __file__ to compute and return a directory path; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard imports and a common pattern for test setup; no suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, sets a pytest plugin, and defines a fixture that resolves the current file's directory and appends a 'roots' subdirectory. All operations are straightforward and typical for test setup. No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test setup script for pytest with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
