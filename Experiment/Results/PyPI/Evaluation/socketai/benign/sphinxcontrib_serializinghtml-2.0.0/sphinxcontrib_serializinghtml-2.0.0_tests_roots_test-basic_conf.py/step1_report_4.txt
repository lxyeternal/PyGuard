  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility function, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'input_data' variable and possibly from environment variables or external configuration if used, but none are explicitly shown here.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include any output functions like 'print' or data writes, but none are explicitly shown. Also, if network or file operations are present, they could be sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'input_data' through processing functions to output or storage points. Specific flow paths are not detailed in the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, malicious code constructs, or obfuscated code are detected. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, utilizing common Python constructs. No suspicious network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns are present. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, does not suggest malicious intent. The absence of hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns indicates low likelihood of malicious behavior. Since only a minimal snippet is provided, the analysis assumes typical usage.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code seems benign, but without additional context or full code, some potential vulnerabilities cannot be entirely ruled out.",
