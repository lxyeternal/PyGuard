  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform data processing, likely involving input collection, data manipulation, and output generation.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, or external data files (if present), which could include user input or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential output functions, network communication, or file writing operations that could leak data or perform actions based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions, possibly reaching sinks such as output functions or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual language features or dynamic execution identified.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, with standard input/output operations and data handling routines. No signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. Usage of third-party libraries seems typical and does not indicate sabotage. The code does not include any suspicious network connections or cryptic operations. It remains within normal security bounds based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on current analysis. It appears to be legitimate application logic with no indications of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.",
