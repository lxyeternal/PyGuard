  "purpose": "Defines custom Sphinx builders for serializing HTML build context and output data into pickle and JSON formats, primarily for caching and processing purposes.",
  "sources": "Configuration data, environment variables, build context, file paths, environment files.",
  "sinks": "File writes (pickle/JSON), copying source files, writing 'last build' timestamp, copying environment pickle file.",
  "flows": "Build context and configuration data flow into serialization functions, which write to files; source files are copied for 'show source' links.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code constructs, only standard library usage and straightforward file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code employs 'pickle' and 'json' modules solely for dumping data, with no deserialization of untrusted data. It performs standard file handling, copying, and directory management within a documentation build process. There are no signs of malicious activity, network communication, code injection, or backdoors. The use of 'pickle' is confined to dumping, which is generally safe in this context, provided deserialization elsewhere is handled securely. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The logic aligns with typical extension practices for caching build data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom Sphinx builders for serializing build context and output data. No signs of malware, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of 'pickle' is limited to dumping data, which minimizes associated risks in this context. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero.",
