  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom Sphinx builders for serializing build context and output data. No signs of malware, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of 'pickle' is limited to dumping data, which minimizes associated risks in this context. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero."
