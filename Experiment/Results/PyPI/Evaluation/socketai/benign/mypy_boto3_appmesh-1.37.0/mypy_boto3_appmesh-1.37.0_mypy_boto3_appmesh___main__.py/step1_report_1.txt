  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the package, including version and package details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout (writes output)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (outputs data), no untrusted data handling or external network connections",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version() -> writes version info to stdout; otherwise print_info() -> writes package info to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple CLI functions to print package information and version details. It reads command-line arguments to determine which info to display. No external network access, data leakage, or malicious code patterns are present. The code structure is straightforward and clean, with no dynamic execution or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility designed to display package info and version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
