  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info and version details.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted input beyond command-line arguments.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.\n   - The code structure is simple and static.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code functions as intended with no logical errors.\n   - The logic for argument parsing (`\"--version\"` check) is correct and standard.\n   - No issues or flaws are identified in the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated score: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These are consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - The confidence score is 1.0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is benign, static, and has no malicious behavior, the overall security risk should remain at 0.\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting no obfuscation.\n   - The overall security risk is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and do not rely on assumptions about vulnerabilities.\n   - They focus on the actual code behavior, which is safe.\n\n6. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static information. It does not perform any malicious activity, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted data in a harmful way. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary; the current evaluation aligns with the code's behavior.",
