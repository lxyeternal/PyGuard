  "purpose": "CLI entry point for displaying package information and version details",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv)",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout via sys.stdout.write",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument, then calls print_version() which writes version info; otherwise calls print_info() which writes package info",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected; no external data fetching or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI tool that responds to '--version' argument by printing the version number, or prints static package info otherwise. It uses standard sys and sys.stdout for input/output. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded credentials or secrets. The structure and content appear typical for a simple CLI script. No malicious or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple CLI utility to display static package information and version. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
