{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point that provides package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 AppMesh.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv, and writes information to stdout using sys.stdout.write().",
  "targets": "Outputs are printed to stdout; no untrusted input directly influences output beyond command-line arguments.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is present in sys.argv, calls print_version() and outputs version info; otherwise, calls print_info() to output package details.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed. The code is straightforward CLI logic with no external data fetching or code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and defines three functions: print_info(), print_version(), and main(). The print_info() function outputs static package info, while print_version() outputs a static version string. The main() function checks for '--version' argument and conditionally calls the appropriate function. The script executes main() if run as the main module. There are no external data sources, untrusted inputs, or dynamic code execution. The code is simple, static, and appears legitimate with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script that outputs static package information and version details. There are no signs of malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
