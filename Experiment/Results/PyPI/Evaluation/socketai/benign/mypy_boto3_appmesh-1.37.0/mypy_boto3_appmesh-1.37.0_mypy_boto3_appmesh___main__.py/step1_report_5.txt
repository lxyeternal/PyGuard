  "purpose": "CLI utility to display package information and version details for boto3 AppMesh stubs.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for displaying information",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (source: sys.argv) to output functions (sink: sys.stdout.write)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and solely outputs static information.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to handle command-line arguments and output. It defines functions to print static package info and version details. The main() function checks for the '--version' argument to decide which information to print. There are no external data sources, no user input processing beyond argument checking, and no network activity or sensitive data handling. The code performs simple string outputs and does not contain obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI utility for informational purposes with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It only outputs static, hardcoded package information and version details. No security risks or malware detected.",
