{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface and imports for the AWS AppMesh service client and related paginators.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator); code annotations and docstring.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no external data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code is mainly import and export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module with imports and exports for AWS AppMesh SDK components, including client and paginator classes. It contains documentation, copyright notice, and usage example, all of which are standard. No untrusted input handling, network activity, or suspicious code structures are present. The structure and content appear typical for a Python SDK wrapper module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface module with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks identified. It simply imports and exposes classes for use in applications.",
