{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an SDK interface module for AWS AppMesh, importing client and paginator classes and exposing them for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions and documentation strings; no untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code flows involve importing classes and defining exports; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the copyright year '2025', which is inconsistent with the current date but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports internal classes, defines an alias, and sets __all__ for exports. It includes documentation with usage examples but no executable logic or data processing. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code. The reports correctly conclude the absence of security issues, and the high confidence score reflects this. The only minor concern is the future year '2025', likely a typo, but it does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified, and no further security concerns are identified.",
