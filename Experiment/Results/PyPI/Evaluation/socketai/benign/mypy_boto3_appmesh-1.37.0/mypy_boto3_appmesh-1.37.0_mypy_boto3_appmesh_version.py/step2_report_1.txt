  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no dynamic behaviors, inputs, outputs, or suspicious constructs. The code is minimal and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' logic or reasoning:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n   - They correctly interpret the code as a version metadata declaration, which is common practice.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - All reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.  \n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0 or 0.0, aligning with the straightforward, non-obfuscated code.  \n   - The `securityRisk` scores are 0, consistent with the absence of any security issues.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   - None of the reports suggest any risk that warrants a score above 0.5. All assessments are correct that this is a simple, benign version declaration.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   - Since there's no malicious activity, the malware score should remain at 0.  \n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe code is a standard, non-malicious version declaration. The reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are correct in their assessment. The scores are appropriate, and the code poses no security concerns.",
