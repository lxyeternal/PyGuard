  "purpose": "Define the version string for the package/module as the source of truth.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable with the string '1.37.0'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or input sources are present; no sinks detected.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: hardcoded version string assigned to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is simple and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a comment, a copyright notice, and a version string assignment. There are no inputs, data processing, or suspicious constructs. The version is hardcoded, which is common practice in Python packages. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
