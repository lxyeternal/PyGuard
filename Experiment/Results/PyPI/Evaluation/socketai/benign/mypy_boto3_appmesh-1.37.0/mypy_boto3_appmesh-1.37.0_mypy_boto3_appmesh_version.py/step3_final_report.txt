  "purpose": "Declare the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "Assignment to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple static string assignment, no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment, a copyright notice, and a straightforward assignment of a version string to __version__. There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic behaviors, or suspicious constructs. The code is minimal, transparent, and follows standard practices for version declaration. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
