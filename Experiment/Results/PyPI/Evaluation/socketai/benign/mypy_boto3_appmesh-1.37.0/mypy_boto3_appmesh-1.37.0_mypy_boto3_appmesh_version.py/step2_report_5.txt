  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic behaviors, or suspicious constructs. The code is minimal and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that this is a benign, typical version declaration. No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is correct.  \n   - **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of any security concerns.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is a straightforward version string assignment with no dynamic or malicious elements, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted. The assigned scores of 0 or 0.0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any malicious activity, obfuscation, or hidden behavior. The malware score remains at 0, which is correct.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   The scores are consistent and reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security issues. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical version string assignment with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores reflect this accurately. The overall security posture is very low risk, and the code is safe.",
