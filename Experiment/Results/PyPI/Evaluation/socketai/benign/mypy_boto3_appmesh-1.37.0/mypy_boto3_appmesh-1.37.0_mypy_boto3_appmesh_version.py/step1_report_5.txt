  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of a version string with a copyright comment. It does not include any input/output, data handling, or logic that could lead to security issues. The __version__ variable is assigned a static string, which is typical in Python packages for versioning purposes. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a metadata identifier for the package/module.",
