{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginator classes for the AWS AppMesh service client to facilitate type-safe pagination in Python applications.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; class method parameters and attributes.",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data sinks; paginate methods accept **kwargs for filters, which are standard for boto3 pagination.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves method calls to 'paginate' with **kwargs, which pass user-provided parameters to boto3 paginators, and do not process untrusted data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. The code strictly defines paginator classes with proper type annotations and documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The script is a structured, type-annotated set of paginator classes for the AWS AppMesh boto3 client, including conditional import handling for Python version compatibility. It relies on standard boto3 pagination classes and type definitions, with no data processing or system commands that could be malicious. The code appears to be standard SDK wrapper code with documentation comments. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe SDK wrapper module with no signs of malicious intent. It is intended solely for type-safe pagination of AWS AppMesh service calls, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
