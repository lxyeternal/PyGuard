  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for AWS AppMesh SDK, providing static type safety and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore, type definitions, and class constructors with **kwargs for paginator parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, external system interactions, or network activity; methods delegate to boto3's paginator.",
  "flows": "Method calls pass kwargs directly to boto3 paginator methods; no external data flows or processing.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; standard class structure, conditional import for Unpack, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured module for type-safe paginator classes, with documentation links and conditional compatibility imports. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The methods simply delegate to boto3's paginator with type annotations, serving as a static type checking aid.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign extension of boto3's paginator classes, intended solely for type safety and API convenience. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.",
