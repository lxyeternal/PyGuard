  "purpose": "Define paginators for the AWS AppMesh service client with type annotations and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, and method implementations that utilize boto3 paginator interfaces and type definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code primarily defines classes and methods without executing untrusted data or external commands.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code is straightforward type annotation and class structure for boto3 paginators.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of paginator classes for the boto3 AppMesh client with explicit type annotations and documentation links. It includes conditional imports based on Python version and careful use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints. No network activity, code injection, or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured type definition module for boto3 paginators, with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type annotation and class definition module for boto3 paginators, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It serves as a type-safe wrapper around boto3 paginator interfaces for the AppMesh service.",
