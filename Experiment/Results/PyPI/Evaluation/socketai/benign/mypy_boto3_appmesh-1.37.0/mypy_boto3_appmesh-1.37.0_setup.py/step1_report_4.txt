{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used to package and distribute the 'mypy-boto3-appmesh' Python library, providing metadata and dependencies information for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the __file__ path to load README.md content, and uses hardcoded strings for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the script does not execute external commands, write to files beyond standard setup, or handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The script reads static file content for long_description and uses fixed strings for package configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is a standard Python setup script with no unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a README file, and calls setuptools.setup() with static, well-structured arguments. There are no indications of malicious activity, such as code injection, dynamic code execution, or network access. All data used is hardcoded or read from trusted locations. The script appears to be a typical package setup file for Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate and typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
