  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'mypy-boto3-appmesh' Python library, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the __file__ variable for the script's directory; reads the README.md file for long description; imports setuptools for setup; defines package data and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Uses the setup() function to define package metadata and dependencies; no external data is processed or executed in a way that affects runtime behavior.",
  "flows": "The script reads static files and passes data into setup() parameters; no untrusted data sources are processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. All code is straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for Python packaging, importing necessary modules, reading static files, and configuring package metadata. No external input, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no embedded secrets or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
