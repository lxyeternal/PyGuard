{
  "purpose": "Setup script for publishing the mypy-boto3-appmesh package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; static package metadata and dependencies; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no execution of external commands or network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the script only reads local files and sets package info; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; standard setup.py structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script with no external data input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. It reads a local README file for description and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks that could leak data, and no flows involving external or user input. The content is straightforward, and no obfuscated or malicious code features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks.",
