  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It's a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python library.\n- Reads a README.md for long description.\n- Uses `setuptools.setup()` with static metadata.\n- No dynamic code, network activity, or external data sources.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious imports.\n- Dependencies are straightforward, with a conditional dependency based on Python version.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, straightforward setup script, no anomalies.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the static nature, no external data, no anomalies.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero)\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) might be overly cautious, but since no actual risk is present, this is acceptable. No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Security risk:** 0.0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion—benign, standard setup script.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Security risk:** 0.0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others—standard, safe setup script.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is a typical setup script.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected or claimed.\n- **Risk scores:** Should be low, consistent with the reports. The only slightly elevated value is the 0.1 in report 2, which seems overly cautious but not unreasonable.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain at or near 0, perhaps 0.1 at most if conservative.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.** The reports are consistent with this assessment. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is acceptable but could be adjusted to 0 for consistency.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or 0.1 if conservative)\n\nThis analysis confirms the reports' findings and supports that the package setup script is safe and typical.",
