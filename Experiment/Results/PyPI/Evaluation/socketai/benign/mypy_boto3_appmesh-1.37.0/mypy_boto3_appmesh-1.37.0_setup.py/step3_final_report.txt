  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the Python library 'mypy-boto3-appmesh'.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static metadata fields for package info; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks, network calls, or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Static data used in setup parameters; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script that defines package metadata and dependencies with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. It reads a local README file and specifies static parameters for package configuration. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Slightly elevated risk scores (e.g., 0.1) are overly cautious but acceptable; for clarity, they can be standardized to 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The overall security risk is effectively zero, and the malware and obfuscation scores should be set to 0.",
