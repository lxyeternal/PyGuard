  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code content, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** Static type definitions for AWS AppMesh, no runtime logic, no external data, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Key points:** Uses conditional imports for Python version compatibility; no executable code or data processing; no signs of malware or backdoors.  \n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is purely declarative, with no malicious elements. The future copyright year (2025) is unusual but not malicious.  \n- **Malware score:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static schema definitions, no external input, no runtime logic.  \n- **Key anomalies:** Future date (2025) in copyright.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is static type annotations, no dynamic code or external data handling. The future date is odd but not malicious.  \n- **Malware score:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Type annotations for AWS AppMesh, no runtime data processing, no external sources, no malicious code.  \n- **Key points:** Standard static type definitions, conditional imports, no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid. No malware or security risks detected.  \n- **Malware score:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above, static type annotations, no external data or runtime logic.  \n- **Anomaly:** Future date (2025) in copyright.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior.  \n- **Malware score:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Static type definitions, no runtime or external data sources, no malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No malware or security risks.  \n- **Malware score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code Content:** Entirely static type definitions using Python TypedDict, conditional imports for compatibility, no functions, no data processing, no external communication, no dynamic code execution.  \n- **Anomalies:** The only unusual element is the copyright year set to 2025, which is likely a placeholder or typo.  \n- **Malware potential:** None detected across all reports. The code does not execute, process data, or include any suspicious patterns.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior present.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — Static type definitions pose no security threat; no runtime logic or external data handling.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a static, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS AppMesh, serving as a schema for type checking and documentation. It is entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed assessments and the nature of the code as purely declarative type definitions.",
