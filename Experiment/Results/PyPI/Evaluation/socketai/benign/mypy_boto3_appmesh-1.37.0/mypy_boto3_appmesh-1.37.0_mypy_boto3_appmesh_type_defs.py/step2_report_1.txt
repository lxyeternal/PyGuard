  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the details therein.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code is static type definitions for AWS AppMesh, with no external or untrusted data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or transmission occurs; it's purely schema definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** The report notes a future copyright year (2025). While unusual, this is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is static, well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior. The absence of runtime logic or external data handling confirms safety.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0 — appropriate. Risk: 0 — appropriate. Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment is accurate. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes static nature; no external input.\n- **Anomalies:** Again, the future date (2025) in copyright.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity or obfuscation; purely static type definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0 — appropriate. Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; static definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** Future date in copyright, but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No runtime code or external data processing; safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0 — appropriate. Risk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static type annotations, no external data.\n- **Anomalies:** Same future date, likely a placeholder.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious patterns; purely static.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0. Risk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static definitions, no runtime data.\n- **Anomalies:** Future date, but no malicious implications.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0. Risk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static type definitions using Python TypedDict, with conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Malware & Security Risks:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.\n- **Anomalies:** The only anomaly is the future year (2025) in the copyright statement, which appears to be a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0 and security risks of 0, which are appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations:\n\n- The code is a static, schema-like module intended for type checking and documentation.\n- No runtime logic, external data processing, or code execution is present.\n- The unusual future date does not impact security but could be corrected for clarity.\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — the code contains no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation or hidden code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose as static type annotations for AWS AppMesh. No further action is necessary.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed review of specific parts or further analysis.",
