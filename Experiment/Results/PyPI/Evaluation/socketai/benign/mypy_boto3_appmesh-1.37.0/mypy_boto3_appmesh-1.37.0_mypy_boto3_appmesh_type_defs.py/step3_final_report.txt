{
  "purpose": "Static type annotations for AWS AppMesh service type definitions, serving as schema for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources; purely static class and type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, external output, or runtime data transmission; schema definitions only.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static declarations without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future year (2025) in the copyright statement, likely a placeholder or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static TypedDict class definitions, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and constants for type annotations. There are no functions, runtime logic, external data handling, or network interactions. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns. The only unusual element is the future date, which does not impact security but could be corrected for clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static schema module for AWS AppMesh in Python, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the placeholder year, which does not affect security.",
