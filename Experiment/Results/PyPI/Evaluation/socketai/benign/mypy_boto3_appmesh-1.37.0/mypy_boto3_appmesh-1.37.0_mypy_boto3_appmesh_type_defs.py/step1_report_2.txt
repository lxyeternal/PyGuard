{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS AppMesh service data structures for use with boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "All data definitions are static TypedDict declarations, primarily importing values and types from other modules, with no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted or external data is processed or output; the code only defines data structures without executing logic or IO operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely establishes type definitions and constants, with no runtime data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a copyright notice with a future date (2025) and an unusually advanced date (2025), which is inconsistent with current timelines; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present; no obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of static type annotations, data structure definitions using TypedDict, conditional imports based on sys.version_info, and comprehensive list of type annotations for AWS AppMesh components. There are no functions, no data manipulation, no external data sources, and no runtime logic. The presence of a future date (2025) in the copyright notice is unusual but does not affect code execution. The type definitions appear standard, and no suspicious code patterns, such as dynamic execution or hidden data leaks, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purely declarative set of type definitions for AWS AppMesh service structures. There is no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks identified. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a placeholder or typo but not malicious.",
