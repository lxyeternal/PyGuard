{
  "purpose": "This code provides type definitions for AWS AppMesh service data structures using Python TypedDict for type annotations and static type checking.",
  "sources": "Type annotations for data structures; no external or untrusted input sources are evident; static definitions with no runtime data input or processing.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is processed or transmitted to external systems, nor are there functions executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this is purely a static schema with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present. The code strictly defines data types and structures without executing logic or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares TypedDict classes, constants, and conditional imports based on Python version. No executable code, network calls, file operations, or data manipulations are present. It imports modules, defines type aliases, and creates data structure schemas for documentation and type checking purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The use of conditional imports ensures compatibility across Python versions, which is standard practice and does not introduce security issues. Overall, this is a well-structured static type definition module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, providing static type annotations for AWS AppMesh data structures. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It functions as a schema definition to assist in static analysis, type checking, and documentation. Overall, it is safe and aligned with its intended purpose.",
