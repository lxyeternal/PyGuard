{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations for AWS AppMesh service definitions, facilitating type checking and API integration in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Type annotation definitions, imported modules, and constant type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause data leaks, code execution, or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observable; the code is primarily static type definitions and data structures.",
  "anomalies": "The code is mostly standard type annotations and data structure definitions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or obfuscated code features are observed. All imports and constructs are typical for type hinting and structured data schemas.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive collection of TypedDict classes and constants used to define data structures for AWS AppMesh service in Python. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, which is normal. The code's purpose is to enforce type safety and clarity in API interactions. No runtime code, executable logic, or external data handling is present that could pose security risks. There are no signs of malicious intent such as code injection, network activity, or backdoors. All components are static, well-structured, and conform to standard type annotation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, static type definition module for AWS AppMesh SDK usage. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The structure and content are consistent with open-source SDK schema definitions, with no hidden or suspicious code elements.",
