{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS App Mesh SDK in Python, mainly used for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Type definitions, imports, and constant declarations; no external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform external actions are present; the code solely defines data types.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code consists of static type definitions without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes an explicit copyright statement with a future date (2025) which is unusual and may be a placeholder or incorrect date; no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are evident. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS App Mesh resources, designed for static type checking with tools like mypy. It uses conditional imports to handle compatibility across Python versions and defines multiple TypedDict classes for structured data. The code appears clean, well-structured, with no runtime or external data handling. No malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms are detectable within these static definitions. The only unusual element is the future date in the copyright statement, which is likely a placeholder or oversight but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for static type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS App Mesh SDK in Python. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is safe and solely intended for type checking purposes.",
