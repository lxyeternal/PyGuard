{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations for AWS AppMesh service data structures, primarily for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type definitions and imports, such as sys.version_info, typing, and internal module imports. No runtime input or external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks involving untrusted data processing, output, or external communication. The code solely defines types and data structures.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. All type definitions are static and do not process or handle untrusted data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. It strictly defines type annotations using standard Python features. The use of sys.version_info to conditionally import modules based on Python version is normal. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of Python TypedDict class definitions and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It imports standard modules and type extension packages, and it clearly specifies data structures for an AWS service SDK. There are no signs of malicious code, runtime data processing, or external communications. All code appears to be purely for type hinting and static analysis purposes. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated logic, no code injection, and no data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of type definitions for AWS AppMesh service SDK. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is purely for static type safety and documentation.",
