  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class for interacting with AWS AppMesh service via boto3, providing method signatures for API operations and pagination.",
  "sources": "Code reads static class definitions, method signatures, type annotations, imported modules, and documentation strings. No external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; the code mainly defines method signatures, properties, and documentation. No data output, network calls, or data processing of external input detected.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves defining a client class with methods corresponding to AWS AppMesh API operations, mainly for type hinting and documentation. No runtime data flow or dynamic execution paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs detected. The code is primarily structural, providing type annotations and method signatures for a boto3 client. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution identified. Documentation strings and imports appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, type-annotated Python module defining a client class for AWS AppMesh with method signatures matching AWS SDK operations. It uses overloads for paginators and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. No runtime behavior, data handling, or external untrusted inputs are involved. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured SDK stub with no malicious intent. The imports, documentation links, and structure align with legitimate SDK definitions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK stub with type annotations for AWS AppMesh client interactions. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is a typical, legitimate part of a Python boto3 stubs package, providing type hints and method signatures for static type checking.",
