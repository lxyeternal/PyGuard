  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the boto3 AppMesh service, providing structured interfaces for API calls and exceptions.",
  "sources": "Code imports, class definitions, method signatures, and property declarations that define client behavior and API interaction.",
  "sinks": "None observed; the code contains no direct data sinks or execution of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is a static interface definition without executable data flows or input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code primarily consists of type annotations, class properties, method signatures, and docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes type annotations and a client interface for the AWS AppMesh service, using standard Python typing and class inheritance from botocore. It includes docstrings referencing external documentation and defines methods with proper input/output type annotations. No dynamic execution, input handling, or external code execution is present. The use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard and safe. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured type stub for the boto3 AppMesh client, designed for static type checking and IDE support. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is a standard interface definition with no executable or unsafe code paths.",
