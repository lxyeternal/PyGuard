  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for AWS AppMesh SDK interface, providing method signatures, documentation links, and pagination support.",
  "sources": "Imports, class declarations, method signatures, type annotations, and documentation references.",
  "sinks": "None; static interface definitions with no runtime data processing or external calls.",
  "flows": "Method signatures serve as API interface; no data flow at runtime in this stub.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, static type stub for AWS AppMesh, primarily serving as an interface for type checking and documentation. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or dynamic code. The documentation links and method signatures are standard for SDK interface files. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe SDK interface stub with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and justified given its static, interface-only nature.",
