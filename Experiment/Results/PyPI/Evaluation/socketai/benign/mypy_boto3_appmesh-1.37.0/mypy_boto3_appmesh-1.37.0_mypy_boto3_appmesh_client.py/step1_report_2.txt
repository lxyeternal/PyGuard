  "purpose": "Type annotations and client wrapper for AWS AppMesh service, providing method signatures, documentation links, and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; property and overloads.",
  "sinks": "None directly; the code primarily defines interfaces and does not process untrusted input or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code defines a client interface with method signatures but no actual data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured interface for AWS AppMesh, utilizing type annotations, overloads, and property definitions to facilitate type safety and documentation. It imports standard modules, AWS SDK components, and local type definitions. No runtime or malicious behavior is detected; the code serves as a type-annotated wrapper around boto3 client functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured type annotation layer for the AWS AppMesh boto3 client. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides type hints and documentation references for SDK usage.",
