  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources**: Defines static type literals for AWS AppMesh and related components; sources are just standard library imports and static definitions.  \n- **Sinks & Flows**: No data processing or external actions; purely static type annotations.  \n- **Anomalies**: No anomalies; code is straightforward.  \n- **Analysis**: The code is a set of type aliases for AWS resource identifiers, with conditional import for `Literal`. No dynamic code, no external data, no suspicious constructs.  \n- **Conclusion**: Benign, purely for type safety. No malware or security risk.  \n- **Score Justification**: Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. — consistent.\n\n**Report 2**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing type safety for AWS SDK components.  \n- No external input, no dynamic code, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion**: Safe, static type annotations only.  \n- Scores: Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 3**  \n- Purpose: same as above, defining literals for AWS resource names.  \n- No input processing, no external interactions.  \n- An unusual note: no anomalies besides the straightforward static definitions.  \n- **Analysis**: No malicious activity, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion**: Benign.  \n- Scores: Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4**  \n- Similar purpose, with a notable anomaly: the copyright date is 2025, which is in the future relative to current date (2023).  \n- **Analysis**: This is likely a placeholder or a typo, not malicious. No dynamic code or external dependencies.  \n- **Conclusion**: No security risk, just a potential inconsistency in the metadata.  \n- Scores: Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 5**  \n- Purpose: same static literal definitions.  \n- An anomaly: the copyright year again is 2025, which is inconsistent with current date.  \n- The report assigns a security risk of 0.1, citing the future year as a possible concern.  \n- **Analysis**: The only suspicious element is the future date, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.  \n- **Conclusion**: No malicious code, no external data, no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores**: Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 — perhaps slightly overstated, but given the inconsistency, acceptable as a very low concern.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (score 0).  \n- **Obfuscated**: All are straightforward static type alias definitions, so obfuscation is 0.  \n- **Risk Score**: The only point of concern is the future copyright year (2025). While this is not a security risk per se, it indicates a possible placeholder or oversight. The reports generally assign a very low or zero risk, which is appropriate.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware**: 0 — no evidence of malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — code is transparent, static, and well-structured.  \n- **Risk Score**: Given the consistent benign nature, I would assign a **risk score of 0**. The only minor concern is the future date, but it does not translate into a security risk.\n\n**Final note**: The code is a standard, benign set of type alias definitions for AWS SDKs, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The future date appears to be a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
