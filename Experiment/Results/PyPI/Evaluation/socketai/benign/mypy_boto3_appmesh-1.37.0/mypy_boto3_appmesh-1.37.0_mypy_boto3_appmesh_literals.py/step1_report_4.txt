{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS AppMesh service configurations and other AWS resource identifiers to support type safety and code completion.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type annotations and does not process external input or untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause vulnerabilities, as the code only declares constants and types.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines static literals.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a copyright statement from 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date (2023), indicating possible tampering or a placeholder. No other anomalies are detected; the code is straightforward type annotation definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version, then defines numerous string literal types representing AWS resource names, status codes, and configuration options. It includes a license comment, but no logic or external data handling. The only unusual element is the future copyright date, which could suggest recent modification or placeholder text. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present; the code is benign type annotations. The overall structure is simple, and the purpose is clear: type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type annotations for AWS AppMesh configurations and resource identifiers, with no malicious behavior detected. The only noteworthy point is the future-dated copyright, which may warrant clarification but does not impact security. Overall, it poses no security risk.",
