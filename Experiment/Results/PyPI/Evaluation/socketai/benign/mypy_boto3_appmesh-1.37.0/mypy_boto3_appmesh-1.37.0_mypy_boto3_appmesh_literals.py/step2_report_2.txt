  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a static set of type alias definitions using `Literal` for AWS resource names, status codes, and configuration options.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard.\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, no input/output processing, no external data handling.\n- The code contains only constants and type annotations, used for type safety and documentation.\n- The only unusual element is the copyright date \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to the current date (2023). This could be a placeholder or a typo, but it does not impact security directly.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines literals for AWS AppMesh and SDK components; sources are benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no external data, straightforward static definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — **Reasonable.**\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type annotations; no untrusted data.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, straightforward, no dynamic code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — **Appropriate.**\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literals for AWS AppMesh and other resources.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious activity; purely static type definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — **Justified.**\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static definitions.\n- **Anomaly:** The copyright year \"2025\" is in the future.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; the future date is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9 — **Reasonable.**\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static literals; no external input.\n- **Anomaly:** Again, the future year \"2025\" noted.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; the code is benign. The security risk is minimal, perhaps slightly elevated due to the future date but not a security concern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9 — **Acceptable.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior; scores are 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** The code is straightforward, so 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is purely static type annotations with no dynamic or external data, the risk score should be very low, close to 0. The only point is the future date, which is likely a placeholder or typo, not a security risk.\n\n**Given the above, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** **0** (no security risk, just a benign static type definition file)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Comments:**\n\n- The reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The only anomaly is the future copyright date, which is not a security concern.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n\n**In conclusion, the code is a benign, standard type annotations module for AWS SDK components, with no security risks.**",
