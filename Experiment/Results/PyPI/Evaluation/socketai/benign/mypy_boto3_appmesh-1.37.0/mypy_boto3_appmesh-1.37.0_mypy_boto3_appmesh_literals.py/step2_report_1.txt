  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, errors, or signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as static type alias definitions for AWS resource literals.\n- They highlight the absence of dynamic logic, untrusted data handling, or external interactions.\n- The only unusual element noted is the future copyright year (2025).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- **No issues are present in the code.** It is a straightforward, static declaration of string literal types used for type checking and documentation.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- **Future Copyright Year (2025):**\n  - Several reports mention the copyright year as 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date (2023). This is likely a typo, placeholder, or oversight.\n  - While not malicious, it could suggest recent modification or placeholder text that might warrant clarification.\n- **No other errors or logical flaws** are evident in the reports.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware Score (all reports):** 0\n  - Correct. No malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n  - Correct. The code is transparent and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:**\n  - All reports assign 0 or very low (0.1). Given the code's static nature, this is appropriate.\n  - The minimal risk score reflects the benign purpose and lack of external data handling.\n\n### Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1, which is appropriate given the code's static, non-executable nature.\n\n### Claims Based on Assumptions:\n- All reports correctly assume the code is purely static type annotations with no malicious intent.\n- The only assumption that could be challenged is the significance of the future copyright date, but it doesn't imply malicious activity.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's static, benign nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering the copyright date anomaly)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The future copyright year (2025) is likely an error or placeholder.\n- The code's purpose is purely for type safety and documentation, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a benign, standard set of type annotations for AWS SDK literals. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.\n\n**Recommended final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or 0.1 if considering the placeholder year)\n\n**Overall, I see no reason for concern based on this code.**",
