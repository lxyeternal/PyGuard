  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using `Literal` for AWS resource names, status codes, and configuration options.\n- The only dynamic element is the conditional import of `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- No external data processing, input handling, network operations, or executable logic is present.\n- The code includes a copyright date of 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date (2023). This is unusual but likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose:** Define type literals for AWS AppMesh and SDK components.  \n- **Sources & Sinks:** No untrusted data or external inputs.  \n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No data flow; straightforward type aliases.  \n- **Analysis:** Confirms the code is benign, with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard type annotation definitions.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for AWS AppMesh and related resources.  \n- **Sources & Sinks:** No untrusted data or external interactions.  \n- **Analysis:** Clear, static declarations. No suspicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely for type safety.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose:** AWS AppMesh literals and resource identifiers.  \n- **Sources & Sinks:** No data input/output, no external calls.  \n- **Analysis:** Static definitions, no dynamic code or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, straightforward.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, with focus on type safety.  \n- **Sources & Sinks:** No external data processing.  \n- **Anomaly:** The copyright year is 2025, which is in the future, possibly a placeholder or typo.  \n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; the future date is noteworthy but not harmful.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, with a minor note on the date inconsistency.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for AWS resources.  \n- **Sources & Sinks:** No external data or execution.  \n- **Anomaly:** Similar future copyright year; no malicious intent.  \n- **Analysis:** No dynamic or suspicious code.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, minimal security risk.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and recommendations:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code is static type alias definitions with no executable or dynamic logic.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected; the code does not perform any actions, handle untrusted data, or include obfuscated/malicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; primarily a static type hints file.\n\n**Special note:** The only unusual element across reports is the future copyright year (2025). This is likely a placeholder or typo, not an indication of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the static, benign nature, a risk score of **0** is appropriate.\n\n**If I were to assign my own scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|-------|\n| 0         | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS SDK literals with no security concerns. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code is safe and typical for SDK type hinting purposes.",
