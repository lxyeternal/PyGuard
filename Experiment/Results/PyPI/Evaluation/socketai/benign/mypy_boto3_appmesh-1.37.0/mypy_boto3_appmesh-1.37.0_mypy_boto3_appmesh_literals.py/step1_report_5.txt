{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for use in type annotations related to AWS AppMesh and other AWS services, to ensure type safety and clarity in the codebase.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the static string definitions assigned to various Literal variables, and indirectly from import statements for 'sys' and 'typing'.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks such as network operations, file I/O, or system commands are present. The code does not process untrusted input or produce outputs that could leak data.",
  "flows": "The code's flow is limited to defining constants and type aliases. No data flows from external sources to sinks, as it is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright statement with an implausible year (2025) and a large list of string literals, which could be an unusual pattern, but no actual malicious activity is detected. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines type alias constants for literals, which are used for type safety in larger applications. The only dynamic aspect is the conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version, which is a standard practice. No code execution, external network communication, or data manipulation occurs. The copyright year is inconsistent with the current date but is likely a typographical error or placeholder, not malicious. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of type definitions for AWS service string literals. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
