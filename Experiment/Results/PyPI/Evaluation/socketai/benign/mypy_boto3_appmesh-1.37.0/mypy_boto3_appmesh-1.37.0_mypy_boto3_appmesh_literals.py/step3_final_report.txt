  "purpose": "Static type alias definitions for AWS resource literals and status codes, used for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static string literals and conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, input/output, or dynamic code.",
  "flows": "N/A; purely static definitions with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year is set to 2025, which is in the future relative to current date (2023), likely a placeholder or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using 'Literal' for various AWS resource names, status codes, and configuration options. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard. No dynamic logic, external data handling, or executable code is present. The only unusual element is the future copyright year '2025', which does not impact security but suggests a placeholder or oversight. The code is straightforward, transparent, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type annotations for AWS SDK literals with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a placeholder and does not pose any security concern.",
