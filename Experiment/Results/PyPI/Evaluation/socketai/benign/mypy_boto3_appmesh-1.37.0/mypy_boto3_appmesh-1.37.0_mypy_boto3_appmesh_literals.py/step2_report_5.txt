  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines static type literals for AWS AppMesh and related components. The sources are just standard library imports and static definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external input/output.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; straightforward static type alias definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Completely benign, with no malicious behavior. The code is a standard pattern for type hinting.\n- **Confidence & Malware Score:** 1, 0. Malware is correctly scored as zero.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on type annotations for AWS resources.\n- Same reasoning applies: static definitions, no external interactions, no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar purpose, defining literals for AWS resource names and statuses.\n- Noted that the copyright year is 2025, which is in the future relative to current date (2023). This could be a placeholder or a typo, but it doesn't introduce any security risk.\n- No dynamic code, no external data handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as above, with the same observation about the future copyright year.\n- No malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar static definitions with some mention of the implausible copyright year.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior.\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) perhaps due to the unusual copyright date, but this is not a security issue—more a metadata inconsistency.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1, which is very low and not concerning.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe benign, static type alias definitions.\n- **Malware:** All scores are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS SDK literals.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The only anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not a security concern.\n\n**Overall malware score: 0**  \n**Overall obfuscated score: 0**  \n**Overall risk score: 0**\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, static type definition module for AWS resource literals, with no malicious or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
