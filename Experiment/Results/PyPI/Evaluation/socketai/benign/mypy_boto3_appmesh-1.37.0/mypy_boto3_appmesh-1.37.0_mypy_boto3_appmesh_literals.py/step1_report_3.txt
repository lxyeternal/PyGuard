  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS AppMesh service literals and various other AWS service identifiers for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Type alias declarations using Literal for various string values; no input data sources.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code contains only static type definitions; no data flow or execution flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward static definitions with no dynamic execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines string literal types for AWS service names, resource names, paginator names, region names, and specific AppMesh literals. It includes conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice. There are no functions, input handling, external calls, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be solely for type annotations and documentation, with no suspicious or malicious logic involved.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign static type definitions file used for type safety and documentation purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, backdoors, or data leaks. It is safe and typical for SDKs or type hinting files.",
