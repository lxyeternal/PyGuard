  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS AppMesh and other AWS SDK components to enable type checking and autocompletion.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python standard library 'sys' for version info; it defines constants using literals without processing untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines constant types.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward type annotation definitions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then defines a series of Literal type aliases for various AWS resource identifiers and options. These are static definitions used for type hinting, with no dynamic or executable logic beyond imports. The licensing comment and documentation link do not contain executable code or sensitive info. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of type alias definitions for AWS SDK literals, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
