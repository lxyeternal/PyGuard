{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations for various AWS AppMesh and related resource literals for type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Import of sys and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output, no data leaks or external system calls.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from source to sink; the code only sets up type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code solely declares constants and type literals. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of string literal types for type safety in AWS-related Python projects. It conditionally imports Literal depending on Python version, which is standard practice. The literals define enums for various AWS services, resource names, and configuration options. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code does not interact with external data, files, network, or environment variables, nor does it perform any runtime logic beyond type annotation definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS resource literals. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is to enhance type safety and code clarity in larger AWS SDK integrations.",
