  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between bytes and integers.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided through function parameters 'bytes_seq' and 'num'. No external or untrusted sources are explicitly read in this code.",
  "sinks": "The functions output byte strings and integers; no data is sent over networks or stored persistently within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Conversion from bytes to int and from int to bytes with optional padding. Data flows from input parameters to output, without external influence or untrusted data handling within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two utility functions: 'bytes_to_int' converts a bytes object to an integer using big-endian byte order; 'int_to_bytes' converts a non-negative integer to a bytes object, with optional zero-padding to a specified multiple. The implementation uses standard library functions ('int.from_bytes' and 'binascii.unhexlify') without any obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious logic. The only exception is a check preventing negative numbers in 'int_to_bytes'. No external data sources, network activity, or potentially malicious code are present. Overall, the code serves simple utility purposes with no evident malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of byte-integer conversion utilities with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is benign and safe for use.",
