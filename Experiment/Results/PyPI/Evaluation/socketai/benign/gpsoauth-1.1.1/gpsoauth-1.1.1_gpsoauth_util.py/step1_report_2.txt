  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between bytes and integers.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; functions operate on provided parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; functions do not handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; functions are simple transformations without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears standard and straightforward, with no hidden or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two functions: 'bytes_to_int' converts a byte sequence to an integer, which is standard; 'int_to_bytes' converts a non-negative integer to a byte string with optional padding. The implementation uses common Python libraries and typical methods, including 'int.from_bytes' and 'binascii.unhexlify'. The code enforces non-negative input for 'int_to_bytes' and handles zero appropriately. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or insecure practices. No external data sources, sinks, or flows indicating malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions for data conversion with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
