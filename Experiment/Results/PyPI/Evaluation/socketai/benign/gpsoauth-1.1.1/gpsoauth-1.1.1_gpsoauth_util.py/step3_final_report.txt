  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between bytes and integers with optional padding.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: bytes_seq in bytes, num in int, pad_multiple in int; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Return values: bytes and int; no untrusted data sinks or external data leaks.",
  "flows": "bytes_to_int reads bytes and converts to int; int_to_bytes converts int to bytes with optional padding.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two standard utility functions using Python's built-in methods and libraries. 'bytes_to_int' converts bytes to an integer using big-endian order. 'int_to_bytes' converts a non-negative integer to bytes, with optional zero-padding to a multiple of 'pad_multiple'. The implementation includes input validation (e.g., non-negative check for 'int_to_bytes') and comments referencing external sources. No external data sources, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The functions are simple, well-documented, and use standard libraries, indicating benign intent. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's structure and logic are clear, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of data conversion utilities with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
