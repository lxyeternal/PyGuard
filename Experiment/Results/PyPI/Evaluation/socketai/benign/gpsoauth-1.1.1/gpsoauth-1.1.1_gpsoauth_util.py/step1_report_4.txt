  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between bytes and integers, likely used for data processing or cryptography.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: bytes_seq in bytes, num in int, pad_multiple in int",
  "sinks": "Return statements producing bytes objects; no external data sinks observed",
  "flows": "Input parameters to conversion functions, then to return bytes or integers; no external data flows or network communication",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Commented source URL does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform standard conversions between bytes and integers. The bytes_to_int function converts a byte sequence to an integer using big-endian order. The int_to_bytes function converts a non-negative integer to its byte representation, optionally padding to a multiple of pad_multiple. It raises an exception if a negative number is provided, which is expected behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. No suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscation present. Usage of standard libraries (binascii) is typical for such conversions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for data conversion with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
