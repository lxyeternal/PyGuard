  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code provides two utility functions:\n  - `bytes_to_int`: converts bytes to an integer using big-endian order.\n  - `int_to_bytes`: converts a non-negative integer to bytes, with optional zero-padding to a multiple of `pad_multiple`.\n- The implementation uses standard Python functions (`int.from_bytes`, `binascii.unhexlify`) and includes basic input validation (e.g., non-negative check).\n- No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or data leaks are evident.\n- The code appears benign, straightforward, and safe.\n\n**Review of the Reports:**\n- All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n- They highlight the lack of anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and malware scores are 0.\n- The analysis is consistent across reports, emphasizing the utility nature of the functions.\n\n**Potential Issues or Inconsistencies:**\n- The only minor point is the `pad_multiple` parameter in `int_to_bytes`. The code raises an error if `pad_multiple` is not 0 or 1, but the code snippet only shows the check `if pad_multiple not in [0, 1]`, which seems inconsistent with the comment stating it can pad to any multiple. This could be a documentation or implementation mismatch, but it does not introduce security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a safe, standard utility for byte-integer conversions.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed; the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, and the reports correctly reflect that.",
