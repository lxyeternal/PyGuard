  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code performs standard conversions with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two functions: bytes_to_int converts a byte sequence to an integer using standard library method. int_to_bytes converts a non-negative integer to a byte string, optionally padded to a specified multiple. The implementation is straightforward, with appropriate checks (e.g., non-negative only). No external network, system modifications, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious logic identified. The only potential concern is that int_to_bytes supports a pad_multiple parameter, but its default behavior is safe. The source comment points to a StackOverflow resource, indicating standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility functions for data conversion with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not contain malware, hidden backdoors, or security risks. The functions are safe and suitable for use in larger projects.",
