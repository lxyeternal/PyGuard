  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between bytes and integers.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; functions operate on input parameters 'bytes_seq' and 'num'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; functions process data locally without external output or side effects.",
  "flows": "Input bytes to integer conversion, and integer to bytes with optional padding.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected. The functions perform standard conversions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for data conversion. 'bytes_to_int' converts bytes to int, which is straightforward. 'int_to_bytes' converts an integer to a byte string, supporting optional zero-padding to a multiple of 'pad_multiple'. It raises an error for negative numbers, which is appropriate. The functions include a comment referencing an external source but do not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs. There are no network calls, data leaks, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of benign utility functions for data conversion, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
