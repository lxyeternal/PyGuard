  "purpose": "Functions to handle RSA keys, parse authentication responses, and create signatures for Google authentication.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded key input, text input for parsing responses, and function parameters for email, password, and key.",
  "sinks": "Base64 encoding output, RSA encryption, SHA-1 hashing, and parsing data from text.",
  "flows": "Input data (b64_key, text, email/password) is decoded or parsed, used to construct RSA structures, hashed, encrypted, and finally encoded.",
  "anomalies": "Use of SHA-1, which is outdated for security; no validation of input sizes or key integrity; no explicit handling of sensitive data beyond encoding/encryption; the code constructs a signature potentially used for authentication but lacks context of verification or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily deals with RSA key processing, parsing auth responses, and creating a signature combining hashing and encryption. The use of base64 encoding/decoding and RSA encryption is standard, but the reliance on SHA-1 is a security concern due to its vulnerabilities. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection. The functions perform cryptographic operations that are typical in authentication flows. No obfuscated code patterns or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to implement legitimate cryptographic functions related to Google authentication. While it employs outdated hashing (SHA-1), there is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The overall security risk is low, though modernization of cryptographic algorithms is recommended.",
