{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling RSA keys and constructing cryptographic signatures, likely for authentication purposes related to Google services.",
  "sources": "Base64 decoding of input keys, parsing of auth response text, input parameters such as email and password.",
  "sinks": "RSA key construction, hashing, encryption, and base64 encoding of signatures, which could be used for authentication or data integrity.",
  "flows": "Input keys and data are decoded or parsed, then transformed into cryptographic structures, hashed, encrypted, and finally encoded for transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious control flow. Use of standard cryptographic libraries without obfuscation or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The functions implement standard cryptographic operations: decoding base64 keys, constructing RSA keys from custom binary formats, parsing simple key-value responses, and creating signatures via hashing and encryption. No indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, network communication beyond local cryptography, or hidden backdoors are present. The code appears to serve legitimate cryptographic functions for authentication. The use of standard libraries and straightforward procedures reduces suspicion. There are no suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical cryptographic utility set, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be intended for secure handling of RSA keys and signatures within an authentication workflow. Overall, it poses no security threat based on the provided code.",
