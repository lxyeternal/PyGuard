  "purpose": "The code provides functions to handle RSA keys, parse authentication responses, and generate signatures for Google authentication structures.",
  "sources": "Reading base64-encoded RSA keys, parsing auth response text, input parameters (email, password), cryptographic operations.",
  "sinks": "Encryption of email and password data, SHA-1 hashing, base64 encoding, constructing signatures.",
  "flows": "Base64-decoded key -> RSA key construction -> key serialization -> signature construction -> encryption of login info -> encoding.",
  "anomalies": "Use of SHA-1, which is deprecated for security; no hardcoded secrets; standard cryptographic operations; no suspicious input handling or unusual logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic operations for RSA key handling and signature generation. It decodes base64 keys, constructs RSA objects, serializes keys, and encrypts concatenated email and password data. The use of SHA-1 for digest is outdated but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration observed. The overall code appears to serve legitimate purposes related to authentication, with no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of RSA key handling and signature creation for Google authentication. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The use of outdated hashing (SHA-1) is a security concern but does not indicate malicious activity. Overall, it seems safe with no supply chain threats identified.",
