  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their findings, the code, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code performs standard cryptographic operations related to RSA key handling, parsing auth responses, and signature creation.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are identified.\n- The code uses well-known cryptographic libraries (Cryptodome) and straightforward logic.\n- Several reports mention the use of SHA-1, which is outdated but not malicious.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Flaws:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and logically consistent with its purpose.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports agree the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risks:** Minor concerns about the use of SHA-1, but this is a known cryptographic weakness, not malicious.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the reports' observations.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 is assigned uniformly, which seems reasonable considering the outdated hashing but no malicious intent.\n\n### Potential Issues:\n- The main concern is the use of SHA-1 for hashing, which is deprecated for security purposes. While not malicious, it is a security vulnerability.\n- No other flaws or suspicious activity is detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the use of SHA-1, a slight increase could be justified, but 0.2 seems reasonable for now.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The code is cryptographically sound but uses outdated hashing, which could be exploited in certain attack scenarios, so a moderate risk level is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **The code is legitimate cryptographic utility code for handling RSA keys and signatures in an authentication context.**\n- **No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain compromise are evident.**\n- **The use of SHA-1 is a security concern but not malicious.**\n\n---\n\n### Final estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (considering outdated hashing, but overall low risk)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across reports.",
