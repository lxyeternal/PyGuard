  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cryptographic utility for RSA key handling and signature creation, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The main issue is the use of SHA-1, which should be replaced with a stronger hash algorithm for improved security. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and safe for use, with a very low security risk primarily due to cryptographic practices."
