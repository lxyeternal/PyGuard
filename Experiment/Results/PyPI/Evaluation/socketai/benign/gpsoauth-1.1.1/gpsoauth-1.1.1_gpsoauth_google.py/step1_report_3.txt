  "purpose": "The code provides functions to handle RSA key parsing, conversion, and constructing signatures for Google authentication.",
  "sources": "base64 decoding in key_from_b64; reading lines and parsing key-value pairs in parse_auth_response; user input for email and password in construct_signature.",
  "sinks": "encryption with RSA in construct_signature; base64 encoding of the signature.",
  "flows": "base64-decoded key data used to construct RSA key -> key structure hashed and encrypted -> base64-encoded signature.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The cryptographic operations seem consistent with intended secure signing.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to handle RSA key serialization/deserialization, parse authentication responses, and generate signatures using RSA encryption. It uses standard cryptographic practices with no apparent obfuscation or malicious logic. There are no network communications or data exfiltration routines, and no suspicious code flow or anomalies. The functions perform typical cryptographic operations relevant to authentication procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is consistent with standard cryptographic handling for authentication purposes. No malicious behavior, malware, or suspicious activities are evident. The cryptography appears to be correctly implemented for its intended use, with no signs of sabotage or data leakage.",
