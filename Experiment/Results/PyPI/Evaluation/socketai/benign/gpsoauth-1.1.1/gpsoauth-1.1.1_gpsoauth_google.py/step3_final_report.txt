  "purpose": "Functions for handling RSA keys, parsing authentication responses, and constructing signatures for Google authentication.",
  "sources": "Base64 decoding of keys, reading lines from auth response text, concatenation and hashing of key structures, encryption with RSA cipher.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted login data (email + password) sent through RSA encryption, signature bytes encoded in URL-safe base64.",
  "flows": "Base64-decoded key bytes -> key_from_b64 extracts RSA components -> key_to_struct serializes key -> construct_signature hashes struct -> encrypts email+password -> encodes signature -> response parsing reads key-value pairs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of SHA-1 hashing (deprecated), no input validation, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation or suspicious control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic operations: decoding base64 keys, constructing RSA key objects, serializing keys into a structured byte format, parsing key-value auth responses, and creating signatures by hashing the key structure with SHA-1 and encrypting email+password with RSA. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The primary security concern is the use of SHA-1, which is outdated but not malicious. The functions are straightforward, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. Input validation is minimal but typical for internal utility functions. The code appears legitimate and intended for authentication workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cryptographic utility for RSA key handling and signature creation, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The main issue is the use of SHA-1, which should be replaced with a stronger hash algorithm for improved security. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and safe for use, with a very low security risk primarily due to cryptographic practices.",
