  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for handling Google authentication-related RSA keys, parsing auth responses, and constructing signatures.",
  "sources": "Base64 decoding of keys, input parameters such as email, password, and RSA keys.",
  "sinks": "Encryption operations with RSA, base64 encoding of signatures, parsing of text responses.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoding -> RSA key extraction -> signature construction using hashing and RSA encryption -> base64 encoding.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. The code performs standard cryptographic operations. Usage of common libraries (Cryptodome) is typical. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard RSA key handling, including decoding from a custom binary format and converting keys to a byte structure. It constructs a signature by hashing key parameters and encrypting a concatenated email and password. The functions follow typical cryptographic practices. No signs of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code appears to be for legitimate authentication mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for handling RSA keys and constructing signatures for authentication purposes. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It mainly processes cryptographic data and parses auth responses. Overall security risk is low.",
