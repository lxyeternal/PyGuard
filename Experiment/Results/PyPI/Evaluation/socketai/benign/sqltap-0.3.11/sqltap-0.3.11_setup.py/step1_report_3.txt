  "purpose": "Setup script for the sqltap Python package, providing package metadata, dependencies, and configuration.",
  "sources": "User input sources include package data files and package dependencies specified in 'install_requires' and 'tests_require'.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if author_email or URL information is mishandled, but no untrusted data processing is present.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; dependencies and metadata are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious logic are present. The code strictly performs package setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and package data. It contains no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. All dependencies are explicitly specified with version constraints, and the code only configures package parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration file with no signs of malicious intent, security issues, or malicious code. It solely manages package setup parameters.",
