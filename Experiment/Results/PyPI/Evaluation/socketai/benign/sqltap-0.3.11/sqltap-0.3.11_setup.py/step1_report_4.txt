  "purpose": "This script defines the setup configuration for the sqltap Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies, author info, and package data from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; configuration parameters are static.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to package setup parameters; no dynamic or external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code appears to be standard package setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package configuration, defines long description content, and calls 'setup()' with static parameters including package info, dependencies, and metadata. All data is hardcoded or derived from static strings. No runtime data processing, input handling, or untrusted data sources are present. No code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package without malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and standard in its structure.",
