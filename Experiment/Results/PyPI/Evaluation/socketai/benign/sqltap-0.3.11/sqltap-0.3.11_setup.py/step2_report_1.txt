  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is a standard setup script with no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code, which is a typical setup.py for a Python package. No issues found.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirms straightforward package configuration with no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Also describes a typical setup script, but notes a `securityRisk` of 0.1.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** The minimal security risk score seems to be based on the presence of static metadata, which is standard. No actual vulnerabilities or malicious code are present.\n- **Justification:** Assigning a small security risk (0.1) might be an overestimate, but it's not unreasonable given the code's static nature. No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same as others, standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard package setup, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports agree there is no malicious code. The setup script is static and only configures package metadata, dependencies, and package data.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- **Security Risk:** The only slightly elevated score is in Report 3 (0.1). Given the code's static, non-executable nature, this is likely an overestimate. The code does not perform any network operations, handle untrusted input, or execute code dynamically.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports. No malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 for all reports. Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 or very close to zero, as the code is standard package setup. The 0.1 risk in Report 3 is likely an overestimate; I would set it to 0.0.\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| 0 | 0 | 0.0 |\n\n**Overall, the code is a typical, benign setup script with no security concerns.**",
