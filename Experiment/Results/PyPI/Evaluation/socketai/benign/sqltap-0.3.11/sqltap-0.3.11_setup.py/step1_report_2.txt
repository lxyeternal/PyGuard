{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'sqltap' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "User input includes package metadata; dependencies are hardcoded in 'install_requires' and 'tests_require'.",
  "targets": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data; the code mainly configures package setup without executing malicious commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup parameters are static strings and lists.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns present. The code is straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and defines package metadata, dependencies, and package data. All values are static, human-readable strings or lists. There are no dynamic code executions, evals, or untrusted input handling. The dependencies listed are standard and relevant to the package purpose. No anomalies or suspicious code constructs are present. The code does not perform any network activity, file system manipulation beyond standard setup operations, or other malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a typical package configuration file.",
