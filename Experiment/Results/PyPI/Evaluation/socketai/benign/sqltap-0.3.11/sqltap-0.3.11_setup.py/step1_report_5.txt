{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'sqltap' Python library, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads static data such as long_description, package configuration parameters, and dependency lists; does not read user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Does not write data to external systems, files, or network; no sinks are present that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining static variables to passing them into the setup() function; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; all code appears standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, defines package metadata and dependencies, and calls setup() with this information. No dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no external data fetching. All data appears static and related to package configuration. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code, no credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply specifies package metadata, dependencies, and data files for distribution.",
