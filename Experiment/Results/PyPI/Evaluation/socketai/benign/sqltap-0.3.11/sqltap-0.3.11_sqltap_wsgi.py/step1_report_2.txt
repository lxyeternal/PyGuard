  "purpose": "Middleware for integrating SQLTap dashboard into WSGI applications to monitor SQL profiling data.",
  "sources": "Reads from environ['wsgi.input'] for POST data, environ.get('PATH_INFO'), environ.get('REQUEST_METHOD'), and environ.get('CONTENT_LENGTH'). Uses self.collector.get() for queue data.",
  "sinks": "Uses SQLTap's report() function to generate HTML output. Potentially vulnerable if report() processes untrusted data insecurely, but no direct sinks for malicious input are visible.",
  "flows": "HTTP request method and path determine control flow; POST body data flow affects start/stop and clear commands; queue data flow into report generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The code reads POST parameters and queue data normally for a profiling dashboard. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a WSGI middleware that controls profiling sessions and serves a report page. It reads input parameters for controlling profiling (on/off/clear). Uses a queue to gather profiling data via sqltap. No evidence of malicious data processing or data exfiltration. The report() function's implementation isn't shown, but assuming standard behavior, it generates an HTML report. No suspicious external connections, credential handling, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation of a profiling dashboard middleware without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a middleware component for profiling SQL queries within a WSGI application. It performs input handling and report serving securely without evident malicious behavior or backdoors. No signs of malware or security risks are detected.",
