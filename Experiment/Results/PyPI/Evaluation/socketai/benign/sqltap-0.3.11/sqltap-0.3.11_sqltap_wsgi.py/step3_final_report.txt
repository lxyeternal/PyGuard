  "purpose": "A WSGI middleware for SQLTap profiling dashboard, managing profiling sessions and rendering reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('PATH_INFO', 'REQUEST_METHOD', 'CONTENT_LENGTH', 'wsgi.input'), request body, internal queue for profiling data.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no external data leaks or malicious sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Request method and path → profiling control via POST body → data collection from queue → report generation via sqltap.report.",
  "anomalies": "Use of unbounded queue (queue.Queue(0)) with non-blocking get; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard WSGI middleware that handles profiling control and report rendering. It safely parses request data, manages profiling sessions, and generates reports. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Input handling is secure, and external dependencies are standard. The queue usage is typical, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious intent or security flaws. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score of 0.2 reflects minimal potential for resource exhaustion or misuse, which is acceptable given the context.",
