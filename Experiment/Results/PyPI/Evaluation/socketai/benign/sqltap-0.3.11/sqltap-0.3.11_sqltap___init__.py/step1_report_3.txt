{
  "purpose": "The code imports SQL profiling and reporting functions and classes from a local module named 'sqltap'.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reading points are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flow points where untrusted data could cause a leak or effect.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable, as the code only contains import statements without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal with only an import statement; no anomalies, secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement, importing functions and classes from a local module. No input handling, data processing, or external network interaction is evident. It does not contain obfuscation, dynamic execution, or other suspicious features. The presence of an import statement from a module named 'sqltap' suggests SQL profiling, but that alone is not malicious. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely to import SQL profiling tools from a local module. No malicious or security-related concerns are evident.",
