  "purpose": "Import functions and classes from the local module '.sqltap' for SQL profiling and reporting.",
  "sources": "The import statement from '.sqltap' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only imports modules.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static import without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an empty docstring, which is unusual but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The empty docstring is a minor anomaly but not malicious. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores are consistent with the code's simplicity. No modifications are necessary.",
