{
  "purpose": "The code imports SQL profiling and reporting functionalities from a local module named 'sqltap'.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .sqltap indicates source data is likely the local 'sqltap' module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or data leakage points are visible.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit source-to-sink data flows; the code simply imports functions and classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an empty docstring, which is unusual but not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement from a local module, which appears to be related to SQL query profiling and reporting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. The presence of an empty docstring is unusual but not inherently malicious. The import path suggests local code organization, not external or suspicious sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be part of a larger project concerned with SQL profiling.",
