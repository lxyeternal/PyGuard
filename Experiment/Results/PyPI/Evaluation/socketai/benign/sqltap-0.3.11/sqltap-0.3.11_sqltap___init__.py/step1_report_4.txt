  "purpose": "Import functions and classes from the 'sqltap' module for SQL profiling and reporting.",
  "sources": "The code imports from a relative module '.sqltap', which is a local or packaged module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements with no executable or malicious-looking code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement, explicitly importing several functions and classes from a local module named 'sqltap'. There are no variables, data processing, or control flows. The import uses relative syntax, indicating it's part of a package or local codebase. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. The simplicity and clarity of the code reduce the likelihood of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign import statement for SQL profiling utilities. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on this snippet.",
