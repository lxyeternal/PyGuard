  "purpose": "Re-exporting 'url_filter' from the 'templates' module, likely for convenience or legacy reasons.",

  "sinks": "No sinks present in this snippet; no data processing or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, but the import statement is from a relative module, which is typical and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a single import statement with a comment indicating it's a legacy re-export. There are no inputs, outputs, or data transformations. The import could be from a local module, which is standard practice. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign re-export of a local component with no malicious intent or security issues.",
