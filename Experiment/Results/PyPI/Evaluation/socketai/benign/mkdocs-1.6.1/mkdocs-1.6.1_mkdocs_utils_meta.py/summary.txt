  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured metadata parser employing safe YAML parsing. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation is present. The main security consideration—parsing untrusted YAML—is addressed by using safe loaders, resulting in minimal residual risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.1, reflecting very low risk due to YAML parsing of untrusted input with proper safeguards."
