  "purpose": "Extracts, parses and transforms MultiMarkdown style data from documents, supporting YAML and inline metadata formats.",
  "sources": "Regex-based extraction of YAML blocks and inline metadata lines within text documents.",
  "sinks": "yaml.load() with SafeLoader or CSafeLoader, which processes the extracted YAML content.",
  "flows": "Input document -> regex matching YAML or metadata lines -> yaml.load() with safe loader -> data dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "Use of yaml.load() with SafeLoader mitigates code execution risks; no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard regex parsing for YAML and inline metadata, then uses yaml.load() with safe loaders, which is a best practice. No network, file, or system modifications are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic. The primary security concern is processing untrusted YAML data; however, the use of SafeLoader or CSafeLoader effectively mitigates this risk. The code's design and implementation are consistent with safe metadata parsing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured metadata parser employing safe YAML parsing. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation is present. The main security consideration—parsing untrusted YAML—is addressed by using safe loaders, resulting in minimal residual risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.1, reflecting very low risk due to YAML parsing of untrusted input with proper safeguards.",
