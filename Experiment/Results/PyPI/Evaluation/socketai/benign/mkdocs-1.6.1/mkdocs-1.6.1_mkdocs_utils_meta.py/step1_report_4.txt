{
  "purpose": "The code extracts and parses metadata from documents using YAML or MultiMarkdown style delimiters.",
  "sources": "Input document string passed to get_data function.",
  "sinks": "yaml.load(m.group(1), SafeLoader) — parses YAML content which could potentially be malicious if the loader is unsafe or compromised, but here it uses CSafeLoader or SafeLoader, which are designed to mitigate such risks.",
  "flows": "Input document -> get_data() function -> YAML parsing via yaml.load() with SafeLoader",
  "anomalies": "Use of yaml.load() with SafeLoader is safe; no other unusual code or hardcoded secrets present. No obfuscation or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily extracts metadata using regular expressions and then processes the content accordingly. YAML parsing utilizes SafeLoader variants, reducing risk. The regex patterns and parsing logic are straightforward and not suspicious. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The function handles data carefully and does not execute any untrusted code or perform network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard metadata parser with safe YAML handling. No malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks identified. It is a well-structured parser with proper safeguards against YAML-based exploits.",
