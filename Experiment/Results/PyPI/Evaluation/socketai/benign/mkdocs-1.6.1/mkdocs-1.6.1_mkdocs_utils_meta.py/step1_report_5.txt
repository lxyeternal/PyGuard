  "purpose": "The code extracts and parses metadata from documents, supporting YAML and MultiMarkdown formats.",
  "sources": "Input document string passed to get_data() function.",
  "sinks": "yaml.load() function used to parse YAML data, which can be a potential sink if untrusted YAML content is processed.",
  "flows": "Input document -> YAML or markdown parsing -> yaml.load() (if YAML detected) -> data dictionary and cleaned document output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of yaml.load() without verifying content, which could lead to code execution if untrusted YAML content is processed. No sanitization or validation of YAML input is performed.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly identifies and extracts metadata using regex for YAML and MultiMarkdown styles. The use of yaml.load() on untrusted data is a security concern since it may execute arbitrary code depending on the loader. The code itself does not contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It is primarily a parser, but the potential security risk lies in YAML parsing of untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a metadata extractor with a potential security concern due to unvalidated use of yaml.load() on untrusted data. No malicious intent or sabotage detected within the code. It mainly parses metadata and cleans the document text.",
