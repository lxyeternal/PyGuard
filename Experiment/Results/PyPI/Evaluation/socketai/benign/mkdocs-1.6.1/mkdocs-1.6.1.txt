The main security consideration—parsing untrusted YAML—is addressed by using safe loaders, resulting in minimal residual risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.1, reflecting very low risk due to YAML parsing of untrusted input with proper safeguards."

The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of installed plugins, which is an inherent aspect of plugin systems but not a flaw in this code. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2). Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
