  "purpose": "Utility functions for MkDocs, including file operations, URL normalization, theme management, and logging.",
  "sources": "Input data from file paths, environment variables, and function arguments such as 'pages' and 'path_list'.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (copy_file, write_file, clean_directory), environment variables (SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH), URL and path handling functions, logging functions.",
  "flows": "Data from input sources (e.g., environment variables, user inputs, file paths) flows through functions such as get_build_timestamp, normalize_url, and create_media_urls, affecting file operations, URL generation, and timestamp generation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; warnings about deprecated functions; normal use of regular expressions and standard library functions. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution observed. The use of compile-time cache and path manipulations appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical utility tasks such as file copying, directory cleaning, URL normalization, theme management, and timestamp calculation. All operations are standard, with proper use of libraries and environment variables for reproducible builds. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or unauthorized data access are present. No network communications or data exfiltration mechanisms are included. The code includes deprecation warnings and logging, which are typical in maintenance code. There are no indications of supply chain attacks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of utility functions for managing files, URLs, themes, and logging in MkDocs. It performs legitimate operations without any malicious behavior or sabotage. No security risks are identified, and the code appears safe for use.",
