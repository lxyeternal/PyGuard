  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard utility functions with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of installed plugins, which is an inherent aspect of plugin systems but not a flaw in this code. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2). Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
