  "purpose": "Utility functions for file handling, URL normalization, theme management, and miscellaneous helpers for MkDocs.",
  "sources": "Filesystem operations, environment variables, URL parsing, plugin entry points.",
  "sinks": "File system (copy, write, delete), environment variables, logging, URL paths.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables and user input flows into functions like get_build_datetime, normalize_url, and theme loading; plugin entry points are used for theme discovery.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated functions, warnings about deprecated modules, plugin discovery via entry points which could load malicious plugins if untrusted plugins are installed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of straightforward utility functions for file operations, URL handling, theme management, and logging. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The plugin system via entry points is a known attack surface but is standard in plugin architectures. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard libraries. The only potential security concern is reliance on external plugins, which is typical but should be managed via plugin source verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard utility functions with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of installed plugins, which is an inherent aspect of plugin systems but not a flaw in this code. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2). Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
