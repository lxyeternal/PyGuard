  "purpose": "Declare the package version string for version management.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; static assignment with no data flow.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "None; minimal code with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a shebang line and a version string assignment. It does not perform any input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The version string conforms to standard formats (PEP-440). No obfuscation, payloads, or malicious logic are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate scoring (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0). The code's simplicity and adherence to best practices justify the absence of security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, minimal version declaration with no malicious or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.",
