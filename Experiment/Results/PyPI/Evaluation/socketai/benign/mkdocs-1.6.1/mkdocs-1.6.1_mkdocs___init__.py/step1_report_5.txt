  "purpose": "Define the version string for the Python package",

  "flows": "No data flows present in this minimal snippet",
  "anomalies": "Lack of any operational code, no suspicious constructs or hardcoded secrets; simple version assignment",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a shebang line, a comment about version formatting, and a version string assignment. No input handling, no data processing, and no execution logic are present. It is a standard way to declare a package version, with no indicators of malicious intent or unusual behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version identifier for the package. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
