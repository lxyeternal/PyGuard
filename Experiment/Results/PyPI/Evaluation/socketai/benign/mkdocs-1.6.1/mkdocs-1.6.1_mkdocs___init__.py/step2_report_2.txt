  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the code snippets they analyze.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports analyze the same minimal code: a shebang line and a version string assignment.\n- The code does not perform any input/output, network activity, or data processing.\n- The version string conforms to standard formats.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's presence of issues:\n- The code is straightforward and contains only a shebang and a version string assignment.\n- No errors, flaws, or malicious behavior are present.\n- **All reports correctly identify this as benign and minimal.**\n\n### Reviewing the logic, reasoning, and summaries:\n- All reports agree on the benign nature, minimalism, and standard practice.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The analyses are consistent and accurate.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- **Obfuscated score:** all reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** all assign 0, which is correct given the code.\n- **Security risk score:** all assign 0, consistent with the code's harmless nature.\n\n### Risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely a version declaration with no suspicious activity, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- No justification exists for higher scores.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are based on assumptions; the code is clearly benign.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- No changes to the scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no malicious or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is needed.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
