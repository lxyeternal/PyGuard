  "sources": "No external data sources; code primarily defines classes and methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data outputs or data flows to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no data processing involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from standard and third-party exceptions for MkDocs plugin framework. It includes a method for displaying messages. There are no inputs, data processing, or external communications. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for error handling in MkDocs. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
