{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for MkDocs, a static site generator, for error handling and control flow.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and does not read external data or input.",
  "targets": "None; the code does not directly write or send data to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or unusual code structures present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules to define custom exception classes related to MkDocs. The classes inherit from exceptions and include a method to display error messages. There are no external data inputs, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic. The structure is straightforward and adheres to typical Python exception class patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for error handling within MkDocs. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks are evident.",
