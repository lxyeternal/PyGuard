{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for MkDocs error handling and plugin errors.",
  "sources": "Static class definitions, imports from 'click', and use of 'echo' for output.",
  "sinks": "The 'echo' function outputs messages; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Class methods invoke 'echo' for displaying messages; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward class inheritance for exceptions, with no dynamic code, input handling, or network activity. The use of 'click' is standard for CLI output. No secrets, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is static, well-structured, and aligns with typical Python exception patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely defining exception classes for error handling in MkDocs. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
