{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for MkDocs, a static site generator, primarily for error handling and plugin management.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions and imports, with no external input or data sources.",
  "targets": "No sinks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external inputs; the code consists solely of class definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining custom exceptions inheriting from external library classes. It uses no user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution. The only external dependency is the 'click' library, which is a common, well-known Python package. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It appears to serve as part of a larger application's error handling structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for error handling within the MkDocs tool, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
