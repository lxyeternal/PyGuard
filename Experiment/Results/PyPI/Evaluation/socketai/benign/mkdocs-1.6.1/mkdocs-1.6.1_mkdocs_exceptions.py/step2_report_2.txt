  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes for MkDocs, with no external data input, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns.\n- The code is straightforward, relying on standard Python exception inheritance and a simple method to display messages.\n- The only external dependency is 'click', a well-known Python library for CLI applications, used here for output.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n**Specifics:**\n\n**Report 1-5 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Define custom exceptions for error handling.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external data or untrusted input processing.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: The code is standard, clear, and safe.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity, no security risks.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated: 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- Security Risk: 0, appropriate given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, with no claims or evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The use of 'echo' in the 'show' method is standard for error messaging and does not introduce security concerns.\n- The reliance on 'click' does not pose a security risk, as it is a common, maintained library.\n\n**Any Reason to Adjust Scores?**\n- Given the detailed analysis and the absence of any suspicious patterns, the current scores seem accurate.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is justified.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0, as the code is not obfuscated.\n- The security risk score remains at 0, consistent with the findings.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is purely defining exception classes for error handling.\n- No external data processing, network activity, or code execution.\n- No indicators of malicious intent or supply chain attack vectors.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- Malware: **0**\n- Obfuscated: **0**\n- Risk: **0**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports correctly identify this code as benign, standard, and free of security issues. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The current scoring is appropriate.\n- No further action needed.",
