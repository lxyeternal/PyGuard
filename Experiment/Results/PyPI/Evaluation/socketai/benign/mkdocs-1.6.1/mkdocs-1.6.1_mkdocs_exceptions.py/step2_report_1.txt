  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports describe the code as straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions in MkDocs, with no external input, data processing, or suspicious behavior. The code is consistent with standard Python exception class patterns, importing 'click' for output and defining error classes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are uniformly consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is static, non-malicious, and does not perform any risky operations. No logical errors or security flaws are evident in the description.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - malware: 0\n   - obfuscated: 0\n   - securityRisk: 0  \n   These seem appropriate given the nature of the code. Since there's no malicious or obfuscated code, and no security risk, these scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports suggest any risk above 0. The code is purely for error handling, with no external data, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score**:  \n   All reports assign malware = 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly identify that the code is static and safe. No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:  \n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for MkDocs.  \n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate** after this review aligns with the reports:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Final assessment**: The code is benign, and the current scoring reflects that accurately.",
