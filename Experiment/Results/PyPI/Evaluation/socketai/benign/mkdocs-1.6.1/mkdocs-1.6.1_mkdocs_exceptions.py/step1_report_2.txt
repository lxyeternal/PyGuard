  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for MkDocs build system and plugin errors, extending from ClickException for command-line error handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for '__future__' and 'click', class inheritance definitions, and method implementations within classes.",
  "targets": "The 'echo' function from 'click' used in 'show' method to output error messages.",
  "flows": "The 'show' method calls 'echo' with formatted message; no untrusted data sources are explicitly read or processed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes for command-line error handling in a build system, utilizing 'click' for output. There are no data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The only functional method 'show' uses 'echo' to display messages, which is standard for error reporting. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of custom exception class definitions for error handling in a command-line tool, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
