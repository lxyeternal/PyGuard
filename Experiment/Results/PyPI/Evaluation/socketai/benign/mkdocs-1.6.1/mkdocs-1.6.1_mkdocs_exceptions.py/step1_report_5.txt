{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for MkDocs, a static site generator, to handle different error scenarios during the build process.",
  "sources": "Code imports modules ('click') and defines classes; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data output, network connections, or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code consists solely of class definitions and inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution. The code is straightforward class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes inheriting from external libraries and built-in exceptions. There are no input handling, no network or file operations, and no dynamic code execution. It appears to be standard, well-structured exception class definitions for error handling within a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this code. It is a typical pattern of defining custom exceptions for a Python application, specifically MkDocs. The code is safe.",
