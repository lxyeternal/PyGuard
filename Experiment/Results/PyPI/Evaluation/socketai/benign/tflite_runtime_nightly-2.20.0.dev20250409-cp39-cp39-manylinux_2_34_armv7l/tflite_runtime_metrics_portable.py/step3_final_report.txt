  "purpose": "Benign placeholder classes for TensorFlow Lite metrics collection, intended for extension.",
  "sources": "Conditional import based on file path, class constructors, and methods that are empty (pass).",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, network communication, or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "No active data flow; methods do not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "All methods are unimplemented; no active logic or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions with placeholder methods, conditional imports for environment compatibility, and no active data handling or malicious patterns. The structure indicates a scaffold or interface for future implementation, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, incomplete stub with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores should reflect no malware or obfuscation, with a very low security risk due to its placeholder nature.",
