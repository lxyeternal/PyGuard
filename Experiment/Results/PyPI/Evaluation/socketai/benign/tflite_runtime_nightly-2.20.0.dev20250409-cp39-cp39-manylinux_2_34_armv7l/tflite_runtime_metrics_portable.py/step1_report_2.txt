{
  "purpose": "Helper classes for tracking metrics related to TensorFlow Lite model conversion and usage.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__file__' variable, imports modules ('tensorflow.lite.python.metrics' or 'tflite_runtime.metrics_interface'), and accepts parameters in class constructors and methods.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; methods are placeholders without active data handling. No data is sent over networks or written to files.",
  "flows": "Initialization and method calls potentially set internal metrics but do not process or transmit untrusted data; flow is mainly internal method invocation.",
  "anomalies": "All methods are placeholders with 'pass' statements; no actual logic, data handling, or dynamic code execution present. The import logic switches based on file path, but this is standard for conditional module loading.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules based on file path conditions, defines two classes inheriting from a metrics interface, and includes methods that are empty (pass). There are no signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The presence of placeholder methods suggests incomplete implementation rather than malicious intent. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or external communications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign scaffold or stub implementation for TensorFlow Lite metrics tracking. It contains no active logic, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The conditional import is standard practice for handling different package environments.",
