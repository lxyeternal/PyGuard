  "conclusion": "The dependency is a legitimate, standard TensorFlow Lite Python wrapper with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of external delegate libraries loaded via ctypes, which is a common pattern but should be sourced securely. The scores are justified and align with the analysis."
