  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for TFLite metrics collection and management.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no output or data transmission occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only defines an interface with abstract methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious constructs; standard abstract class pattern used.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'abc' module to define an abstract base class, 'TFLiteMetricsInterface', with multiple abstract methods related to metrics tracking and error setting. There are no data inputs, outputs, or untrusted data flows. The class and methods are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security issues. The code appears to be part of a larger framework or library, providing a contract for implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard interface definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a contract for other classes to implement metrics-related functions. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.",
