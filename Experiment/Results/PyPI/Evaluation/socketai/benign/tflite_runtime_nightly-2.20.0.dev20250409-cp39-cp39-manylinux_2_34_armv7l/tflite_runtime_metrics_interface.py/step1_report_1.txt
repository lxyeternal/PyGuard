  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for TFLite metrics collection and configuration.",
  "sources": "No input data reading, no external data sources or user input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, outputs, or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely interface definitions with no implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code contains standard abstract class pattern with method signatures only.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the abc module to create an abstract base class for metrics handling. It defines a class with several abstract methods intended for metrics tracking and configuration related to TFLite. There is no data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution. No signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is a typical interface with no implementation, serving as a contract for subclasses.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign abstract class defining an interface for metrics management. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
