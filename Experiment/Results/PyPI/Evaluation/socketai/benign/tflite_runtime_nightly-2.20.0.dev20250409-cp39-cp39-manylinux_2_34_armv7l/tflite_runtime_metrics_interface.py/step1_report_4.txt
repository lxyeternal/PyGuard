{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for TensorFlow Lite metrics collection and management.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; code is an interface class with abstract methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; methods are abstract and do not perform any actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond method definitions; no data processing or transmission present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; code is a straightforward abstract class with unimplemented methods.",
  "analysis": "The code solely declares an abstract class with method signatures intended for extension. It does not include any data input, output, or execution logic. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscated code are present. The code serves as an interface template for metrics handling, and it appears to be part of a legitimate TensorFlow project, as indicated by licensing comments and structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign interface definition with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of TensorFlow's metrics system.",
