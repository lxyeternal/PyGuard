  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface class for TFLite metrics collection and management.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'abc' module for abstract class creation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; code only declares abstract methods.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets. No dynamic execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with multiple abstract methods related to metrics handling for TFLite. It only imports the standard 'abc' module and declares method signatures with no implementation or data processing logic. No input/output operations, network access, or secret handling are present. It functions solely as an interface, so it cannot be malicious. No signs of malware, suspicious behavior, or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign abstract interface definition for metrics collection in TensorFlow Lite. It shows no malicious intent or security risk.",
