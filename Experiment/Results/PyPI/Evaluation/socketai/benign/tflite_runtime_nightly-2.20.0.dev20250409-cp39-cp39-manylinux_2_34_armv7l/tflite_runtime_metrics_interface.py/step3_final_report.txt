  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for TensorFlow Lite metrics collection and configuration.",
  "sources": "Method signatures that set or increase counters and parameters, no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication; methods only raise NotImplementedError.",
  "flows": "No data flow; abstract methods are placeholders without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward interface with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple abstract class using the abc module, defining several abstract methods related to metrics and configuration. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or external communication. The code is standard for interface definitions in Python, especially within large frameworks like TensorFlow. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard interface class with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify its nature, and the scores are justified.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
