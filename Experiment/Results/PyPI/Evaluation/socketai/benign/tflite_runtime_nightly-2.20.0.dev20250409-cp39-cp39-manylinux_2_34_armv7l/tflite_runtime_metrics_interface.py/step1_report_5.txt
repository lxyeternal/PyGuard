  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for TensorFlow Lite metrics collection.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines abstract methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected. All methods are placeholders raising NotImplementedError.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward abstract class definition for a metrics interface with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. It contains only method declarations that raise NotImplementedError, indicating it's meant to be subclassed. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard interface definition with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is unlikely to pose any security risks.",
