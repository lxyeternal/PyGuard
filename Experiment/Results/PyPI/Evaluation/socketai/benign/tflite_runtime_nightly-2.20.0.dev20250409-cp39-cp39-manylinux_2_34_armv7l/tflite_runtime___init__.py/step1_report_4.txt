  "purpose": "Defines version information for the package, likely used for version tracking and debugging.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting __version__ and __git_version__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only assigns string literals to variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of version strings with 'dev' in __version__, indicating a development version; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static strings to variables indicating version information. The __version__ includes 'dev', suggesting a development or pre-release version, which is common in development environments but not inherently suspicious. No external input, no data leaks, and no malicious logic are present. The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version identifier with no malicious intent. The presence of 'dev' suggests it's a development version, but this is standard practice and not suspicious. No security concerns are evident.",
