  "purpose": "Store version and Git version information of the package",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings (__version__, __git_version__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output or external data handling",
  "flows": "No data flows; simple variable assignments",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'dev' in version string suggests development version, but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments defining version identifiers. The __version__ string includes 'dev', indicating a development build, which is common. No external input, data processing, or suspicious code patterns are present. No indications of malware or malicious behavior are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward version information assignment with no malicious intent or security risks.",
