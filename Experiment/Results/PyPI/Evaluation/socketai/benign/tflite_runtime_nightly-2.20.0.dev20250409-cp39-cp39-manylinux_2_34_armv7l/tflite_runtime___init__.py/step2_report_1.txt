  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only consists of static string assignments to `__version__` and `__git_version__`.\n   - There are no data flows, input/output operations, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is standard for defining version metadata in Python packages.\n\n2. **Potential Anomalies or Concerns:**\n   - The only noted anomaly is the presence of `'dev'` in the `__version__` string, which indicates a development build. This is common practice and not suspicious.\n   - No reports mention any suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n\n3. **Malware and Security Risks:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior is detected.\n   - The security risk score is also 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.\n\n4. **Score Justification:**\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's content.\n   - Since the code is purely static metadata assignment, higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Critical Review:**\n   - No claims or evidence suggest malicious intent.\n   - The presence of `'dev'` in the version string is typical for development versions, not an indicator of malicious activity.\n   - The code is straightforward and common in software projects.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct, no security risk)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe report's scores are appropriate and justified based on the code content. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates after review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
