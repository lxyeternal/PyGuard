  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code consists solely of static string assignments to `__version__` and `__git_version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code execution, or any suspicious patterns. The code is standard for version metadata in Python packages.\n\n2. **Presence of 'dev' in Version String**:  \n   Multiple reports note that `__version__` contains `'dev'`, indicating a development build. This is common practice and not inherently malicious or suspicious.\n\n3. **Potential Anomalies or Risks**:  \n   No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward and benign.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature. No evidence suggests malicious intent.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of any security concern.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores?**  \n   The scores seem appropriate. Since there's no malicious or suspicious activity, scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment & Recommendations**:  \n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no security issues.  \n   - The inclusion of `'dev'` in the version string is standard and not a concern.  \n   - No need to adjust scores or flag any potential issues.\n\n**Final Evaluation & My Own Scores**:\n\n- **Malware**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0 (clear, static string assignments)  \n- **Risk**: 0 (no security risk present)\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is purely metadata for versioning, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
