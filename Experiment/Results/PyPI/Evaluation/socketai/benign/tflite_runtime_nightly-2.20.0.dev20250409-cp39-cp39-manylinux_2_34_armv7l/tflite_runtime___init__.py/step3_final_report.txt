  "purpose": "Static version and git version metadata declarations in a Python package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static string literals to __version__ and __git_version__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data or external inputs involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'dev' in __version__ indicating a development build, which is standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments for versioning metadata, with no dynamic code, input/output, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. Multiple reports correctly identify this benign nature. The inclusion of 'dev' in the version string is typical for development versions. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are consistent and justified given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign version declaration snippet with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
