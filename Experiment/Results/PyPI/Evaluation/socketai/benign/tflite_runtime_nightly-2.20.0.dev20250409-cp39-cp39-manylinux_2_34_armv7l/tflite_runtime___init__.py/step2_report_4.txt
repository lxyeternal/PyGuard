  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code carefully.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\n__version__ = '2.20.0dev20250409'\n__git_version__ = '0.6.0-178364-gfe99cc2b577'\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present\n- The code is straightforward: static string assignments for version info.\n- No dynamic code, no input/output, no obfuscation.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears benign and standard for version declaration.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Review each report's reasoning and scores\n\n**Reports 1-5 Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is simple version assignment.\n- They note the presence of 'dev' in the version string, indicating a development build, which is common.\n- No external data sources, no data flows, no suspicious patterns.\n- All assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n- Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and sound. The code is standard version info assignment, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Are the scores reasonable?\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Any adjustments?**  \nNo. The scores align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Justify higher risk scores if any\n- The code contains no dynamic elements, no external inputs, no suspicious patterns.\n- The presence of 'dev' in the version string is normal for development versions, not malicious.\n- No reason to assign any higher risk.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Challenge assumptions\n- All reports assume the code is benign based on static analysis.\n- Given the simplicity, this is justified.\n- No hidden malicious code or obfuscation is present.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Final personal assessment\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious features.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of findings:**\n\n| Score Type     | My Estimated Score | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                    | No malicious behavior detected; static version info only.  |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                    | Clear, straightforward string assignments.                  |\n| Security Risk  | 0                    | No vulnerabilities, no external data, no suspicious patterns.|\n\n---\n\n## **Final note:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, and the scores assigned are appropriate. There is no evidence to suggest any malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe version declaration snippet with no security concerns.",
