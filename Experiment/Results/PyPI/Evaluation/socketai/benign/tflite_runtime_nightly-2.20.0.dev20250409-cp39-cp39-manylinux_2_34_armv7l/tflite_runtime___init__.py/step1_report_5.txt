  "anomalies": "Use of 'dev' in the version string could indicate development version, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns string literals to version variables, indicating package version and Git version info. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious behavior. The presence of version identifiers is common and does not pose security risks. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to specify version information with no malicious intent or security issues.",
