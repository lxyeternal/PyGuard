  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward version info assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns static strings to version variables. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. It appears as standard version declaration code common in Python packages.",
