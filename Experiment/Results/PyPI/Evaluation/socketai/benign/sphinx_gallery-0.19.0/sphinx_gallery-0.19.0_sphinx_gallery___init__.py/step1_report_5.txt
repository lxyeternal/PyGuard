  "purpose": "Provide a utility function to retrieve the absolute path to static files within a package directory.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.path.dirname, __file__",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard usage of os.path functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module, defines a version string, and a function that computes a static directory path relative to the current file location. The version string is for documentation purposes. The function uses standard os.path operations to construct an absolute path, with no input from external sources or untrusted data. There are no indications of data leaks, malicious payloads, or obfuscated behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for static file path resolution within a package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs a standard utility function, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
