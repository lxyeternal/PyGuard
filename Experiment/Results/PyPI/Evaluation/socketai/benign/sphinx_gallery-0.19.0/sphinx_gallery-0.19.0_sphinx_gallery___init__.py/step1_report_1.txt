  "purpose": "Provides utility function to retrieve the absolute path to static files for Sphinx Gallery documentation.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.path.dirname, os.path.join, __file__",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks identified; path functions operate on known inputs.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations; static path generation from __file__ is safe.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and defines a function to compute an absolute path based on the current file's directory. It uses standard library functions with no external or untrusted inputs. The version string is static and not manipulated. The function simply joins directory paths and resolves them to an absolute path, which is a common pattern for static resource management in documentation tools. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving a straightforward utility role with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
