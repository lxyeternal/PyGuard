  "purpose": "Provide configuration and utility functions for Sphinx Gallery documentation, specifically managing static file paths.",
  "sources": "os module import, __version__ variable",
  "sinks": "os.path.abspath, os.path.join",
  "flows": "None involving untrusted input; static path resolution using __file__ and os functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code only computes a static file path.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module, defines a version string, and a function that returns the absolute path to a '_static' directory relative to the current file. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity or data leaks. The code performs a straightforward path calculation for static assets used in documentation. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a utility for static file path resolution in documentation. No signs of malicious intent or security risks identified.",
