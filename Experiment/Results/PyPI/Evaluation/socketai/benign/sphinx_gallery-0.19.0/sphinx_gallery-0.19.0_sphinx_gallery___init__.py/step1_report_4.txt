  "purpose": "Provide a utility function to return the absolute path to static files for Sphinx Gallery documentation.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.path.dirname, __file__",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks identified",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward path computation with standard library functions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and a function to return a static files directory path using standard os.path functions. It imports only the os module, uses __file__ to determine current file location, and constructs an absolute path. There is no input/output of untrusted data, no network activity, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be benign and typical for a configuration or utility script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function for static file path resolution with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
