  "purpose": "Provide version information and static file path for Sphinx Gallery documentation.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.path.dirname, __file__",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code simply computes and returns a file path.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The version string is static and not sensitive.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and a function to compute a static file path relative to the current file location. It uses standard Python libraries and constructs with no user input, no external data fetching, and no code execution or data leakage mechanisms. The code appears to serve straightforward utility purposes in documentation generation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply computes and returns a path based on the current file location, which is standard practice in configuration scripts.",
