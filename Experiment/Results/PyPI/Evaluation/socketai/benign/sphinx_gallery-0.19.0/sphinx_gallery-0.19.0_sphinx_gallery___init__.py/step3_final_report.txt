  "purpose": "Provides the static version string and a utility function to resolve the absolute path to a '_static' directory relative to the current file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__file__' variable to determine the current file's directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "The function constructs a path from '__file__' using 'os.path' functions, with no external data flow or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static version string and a utility function that constructs an absolute path to a '_static' directory relative to the current file. It uses safe, standard Python functions with no external or untrusted inputs, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. The code serves a typical purpose in documentation or configuration scripts. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified. The confidence level is high (1), given the simplicity and safety of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility function for static path resolution with no security risks or malicious intent. The existing reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
