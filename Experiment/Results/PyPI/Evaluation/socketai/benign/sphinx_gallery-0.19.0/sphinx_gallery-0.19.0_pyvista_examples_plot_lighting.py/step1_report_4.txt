{
  "purpose": "The code visualizes a 3D mesh using pyvista, demonstrating lighting properties such as ambient, diffuse, and specular in rendering.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from pyvista's example download function (`examples.download_st_helens()`), which fetches a sample dataset for visualization.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any data transmission, file writing, or external communication; it only renders visualizations locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the downloaded mesh object into plotting functions with various lighting parameters, without untrusted input manipulation or external output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code uses standard visualization library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pyvista and its examples module, downloads a sample mesh dataset, applies warping, and visualizes the mesh with different lighting parameters. It does not perform any external network communication, data leakage, or malicious actions. The code is straightforward, with well-known library functions, and appears to be for demonstration purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization script demonstrating lighting features of pyvista. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious payloads, or security risks.",
