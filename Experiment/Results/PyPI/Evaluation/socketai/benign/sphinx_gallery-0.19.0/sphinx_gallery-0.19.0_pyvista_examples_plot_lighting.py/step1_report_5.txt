  "purpose": "The code visualizes a 3D mesh with various lighting properties using the pyvista library.",
  "sources": "Download of the St. Helens mesh via examples.download_st_helens()",
  "sinks": "None; the code only processes and visualizes local mesh data without sending or receiving untrusted data externally",
  "flows": "Download mesh -> Apply warp -> Visualize with different lighting settings",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, and no dynamic execution or external data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The script imports pyvista and examples, downloads a mesh, applies transformations, and visualizes it with different lighting parameters. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network connections, data leaks, or backdoors. All functions are standard visualization routines. No suspicious code flows or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard 3D visualization of a mesh with configurable lighting properties. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
