{
  "purpose": "To visualize a mesh with various lighting and rendering settings using the pyvista library.",
  "sources": "Downloading and processing the 'st_helens' example mesh from pyvista's examples module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; rendering functions display visualizations, which are safe.",
  "flows": "Mesh download and warp -> Visualization calls with various parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No unusual code behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pyvista and its examples, downloads a standard example mesh, and applies transformations. It then generates multiple plots demonstrating lighting effects. All operations involve standard visualization functions without any external data injection or malicious behavior. No network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical visualization example using pyvista. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It solely demonstrates rendering features of a 3D mesh with different lighting parameters.",
