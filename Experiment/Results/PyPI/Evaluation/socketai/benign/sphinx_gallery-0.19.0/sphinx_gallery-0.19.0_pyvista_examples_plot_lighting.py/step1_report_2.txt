{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates visualization of a mesh with lighting properties using the pyvista library.",
  "sources": "Download of mesh data via examples.download_st_helens()",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; visualization functions display data but do not transmit or store untrusted input",
  "flows": "Mesh data flows from download_st_helens() to plotting functions; no data flows to external systems or network",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or hidden logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports pyvista and examples, downloads a mesh, applies transformations, and visualizes it with different lighting properties. It performs standard visualization tasks without any data exfiltration, network communication, or malicious activity. There are no indications of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward example of mesh visualization using pyvista with lighting controls. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are detected.",
