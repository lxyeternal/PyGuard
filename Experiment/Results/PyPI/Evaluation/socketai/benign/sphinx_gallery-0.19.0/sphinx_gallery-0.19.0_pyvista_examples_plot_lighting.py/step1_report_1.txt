{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates usage of the pyvista library to visualize a 3D mesh with various lighting and shading properties.",
  "sources": "The code reads mesh data from an external example download function: examples.download_st_helens().",
  "sinks": "The code renders visualizations and manipulates mesh lighting; no sinks that lead to data leaks or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external mesh download into visualization functions that render the mesh with different lighting parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The code uses publicly available library functions without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pyvista, downloads an example mesh, applies transformations, and visualizes it with different lighting settings. It does not execute any untrusted input, perform network operations, or manipulate system resources beyond standard visualization. No suspicious behaviors or malicious code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign demonstration of visualization capabilities using pyvista. It solely utilizes open-source library functions for mesh rendering with different lighting parameters, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
