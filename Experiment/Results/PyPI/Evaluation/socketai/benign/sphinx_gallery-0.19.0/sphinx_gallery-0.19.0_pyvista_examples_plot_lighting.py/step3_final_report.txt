{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates visualization of a mesh using pyvista, applying various lighting effects for illustrative purposes.",
  "sources": "Download of the 'st_helens' mesh via pyvista's examples.download_st_helens() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; visualization occurs locally without data transmission or external effects.",
  "flows": "Mesh data flows from the download function to visualization routines with lighting parameters applied.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard library functions with no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign visualization script that fetches a known example dataset and visualizes it with different lighting settings. It does not perform any network communication beyond the initial dataset fetch, nor does it manipulate or transmit data maliciously. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. The code uses standard, well-documented functions from pyvista and examples, and the overall structure is clear and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard visualization example with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing reports correctly identify its benign nature. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
