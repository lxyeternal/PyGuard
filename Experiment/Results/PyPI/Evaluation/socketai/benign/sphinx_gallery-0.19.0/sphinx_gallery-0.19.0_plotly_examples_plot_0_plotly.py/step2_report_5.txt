  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code demonstrates standard usage of plotly with internal datasets, no external or untrusted input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Figures are rendered locally, no data exfiltration or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is benign, straightforward visualization, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Security Risk: 0 (correct)  \n- Confidence: 1 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Fully consistent, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1, uses static datasets, no external untrusted data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Figures are created and displayed locally, no network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, purely visualization.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 — slightly above zero, perhaps considering the potential for future misuse, but given the code's benign nature, this is somewhat conservative.\n\n**Verdict:** The security risk score might be slightly inflated but not unreasonable. Overall, consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard plotting code with static datasets.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0 — consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, standard datasets, no external input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or file system activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Pure visualization code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same, standard datasets, no untrusted input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Figures are created and displayed locally.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- The malware scores are appropriately set to 0.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, with one at 0.1, which is conservative but not unreasonable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores for the entire code:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a safe, standard example of using plotly for data visualization. No adjustments needed based on the provided reports.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future code that might introduce external inputs or network activity, but in this case, all evidence points to benign, illustrative code.",
