{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates usage of the plotly library to generate various interactive plots and figures for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports of numpy and plotly libraries, usage of px.data for datasets, creation of plotly figures, and layout updates.",
  "sinks": "Display of plotly figures (fig), which are used for rendering visualizations. No untrusted input, no external data fetching beyond static datasets.",
  "flows": "Import datasets -> create figures using static data -> update figure layouts -> display figures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded data and parameters are used for visualization. No suspicious code, secrets, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports numpy and plotly, then constructs several visualization figures with static datasets: 'tips' and 'gapminder'. Figures are configured with layout updates and rendering options. No user input handling, external untrusted data, or network activity is present. No obfuscated code or hidden functions are detected. All code appears to serve legitimate data visualization purposes with static data sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward example demonstrating the use of the plotly library for data visualization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It solely uses static datasets and standard library functions for visualization purposes.",
