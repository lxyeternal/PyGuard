  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes usage of plotly, datasets, and figure creation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; figures are displayed, no external data fetched at runtime.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; code is straightforward, benign, and uses standard libraries.\n- **Confidence:** 1, Obfuscated: 0, Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate and aligns with the code. The security risk is negligible; no issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar to above, uses static datasets.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; no external untrusted input or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid; code is a standard visualization script with no malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, Obfuscated: 0, Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.1\n\n**Note on securityRisk score:** Given the code's benign nature, a security risk of 0.1 seems slightly high. It might be conservative, but since there's no actual security concern, I suggest lowering it to **0** for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar to previous, standard plotting.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; no untrusted data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; straightforward, benign code.\n- **Confidence:** 1, Obfuscated: 0, Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the code is a typical example of plotting with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; uses static datasets.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; no external or untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; safe, standard visualization code.\n- **Confidence:** 1, Obfuscated: 0, Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; demonstrates plotting.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; no external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; benign visualization code.\n- **Confidence:** 1, Obfuscated: 0, Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Recommendations:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- The malware scores are appropriately zero.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, except for report 2, which has 0.1. Given the code's benign nature, I recommend **reducing the securityRisk score in report 2 from 0.1 to 0** for consistency.\n\n### Overall Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign example demonstrating plotly's visualization capabilities. No security concerns or malicious behaviors are present.",
