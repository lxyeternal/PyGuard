{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates the usage of the Plotly library for creating various interactive plots and figures, including bar charts, sunburst diagrams, and combined subplots.",
  "sources": "The code imports data from plotly.express datasets (`px.data.tips()` and `px.data.gapminder()`), and reads no external input beyond these datasets. It does not read untrusted user input or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks, network connections, or system modifications. The code outputs figures for visualization but does not perform any file writing, network operations, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset functions into plotting functions, generating figures for display. No external or untrusted data flows into vulnerable or sink points.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code constructs, or obfuscated code are detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured for visualization purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports standard plotting libraries, loads datasets from plotly.express, and creates various figures for demonstration purposes. No user input, environment variables, or network communications are involved. No malicious behaviors or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely demonstrative for plotting with plotly and contains no malicious intent or security risks. It operates entirely within the scope of data visualization using standard libraries and datasets.",
