  "purpose": "The code demonstrates usage of the plotly library for data visualization, including static datasets and various plot types.",
  "sources": "Static datasets within plotly (px.data.tips(), px.data.gapminder()), no external or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "Figures are rendered locally with no network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static datasets to plotly plotting functions, ending with local rendering of figures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard plotly functions with static, trusted datasets. It does not perform any network activity, file operations, or data collection from untrusted sources. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious constructs. All figures are generated and displayed locally, indicating benign behavior. No anomalies or security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example of data visualization using plotly, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
