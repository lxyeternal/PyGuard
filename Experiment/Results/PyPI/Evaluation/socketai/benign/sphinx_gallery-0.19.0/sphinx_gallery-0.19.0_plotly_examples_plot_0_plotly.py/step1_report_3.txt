{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates how to generate various plots using the plotly library, including high-level express plots and low-level graph_objects with subplots.",
  "sources": "Import statements (numpy, plotly.express, plotly.graph_objects, make_subplots), data retrieval from plotly datasets (px.data.tips(), px.data.gapminder()), plotly figure creation and update methods.",
  "sinks": "Display of figures via fig (implicit rendering), no direct data output or network connections observed.",
  "flows": "Data from datasets flows into plotly functions (px.bar, px.sunburst, go.Bar, go.Pie), resulting figures are generated and rendered; no untrusted data sources or sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic; usage of well-documented, standard plotly functions and datasets. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, or network communications.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries, loads datasets from plotly's own datasets, and creates various plots with standard plotly API calls. The code includes comments and is straightforward. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is present. The code is focused solely on data visualization, with no signs of hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign example of plotting with the plotly library. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. All operations are standard data visualization procedures using trusted libraries.",
