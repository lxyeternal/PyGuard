{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates how to create various interactive plots using the plotly library in Python, including high-level API usage with plotly express and low-level graph_objects with subplots.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the plotly.express datasets (`px.data.tips()` and `px.data.gapminder()`) and imports from plotly modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions, such as network communication, file writing, or command execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the dataset functions into plotting functions (px.bar, px.sunburst, make_subplots), with no external or untrusted input influencing the code. The figure objects are created in memory and only displayed in the notebook or exported through plotly's internal mechanisms.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behaviors. The code strictly utilizes standard plotly API calls and data manipulation. No hardcoded credentials, environment variable use, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports datasets from plotly.express, constructs various plots (bar, sunburst, combined subplots) using standard API calls, and updates layout parameters. All imported modules and functions are from well-known, open-source plotting libraries with no indication of malicious intent. The code appears to be intended for visualization purposes only, with no network, file system, or system command interactions. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward example of creating interactive plots with plotly, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely relies on legitimate plotting library functions for visualization. No security concerns identified.",
