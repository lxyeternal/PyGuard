{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates usage of the plotly graphing library in Python for creating various interactive plots, including bar, sunburst, and combined subplots.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy, plotly.express, plotly.graph_objects, and plotly.subplots; data from plotly's built-in datasets; creation and updating of plotly figures.",
  "sinks": "Display of plotly figures, which are generally rendered in a browser or embedded in a notebook, without any network transmission or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported datasets into figure objects which are then rendered or updated; no external untrusted input is read at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; all library usage aligns with standard plotting practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward demonstration of the plotly library's capabilities, including data visualization with datasets provided internally by plotly, figure creation, layout updates, and rendering. There are no indications of malicious network activity, data leakage, or harmful code constructs. The code is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign example illustrating plotly's visualization features. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain sabotage. It is safe for use.",
