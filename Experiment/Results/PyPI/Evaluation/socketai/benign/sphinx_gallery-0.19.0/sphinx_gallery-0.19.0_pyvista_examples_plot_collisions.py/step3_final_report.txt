  "purpose": "Visualization of collision detection between two meshes (spheres) using pyvista and vtk, demonstrating movement and contact detection.",
  "sources": "Mesh creation (pv.Sphere), mesh translation (sphere1.translate), collision detection (sphere0.collision(sphere1)), frame writing (pl.write_frame).",
  "sinks": "Updating 'collisions' scalar array, writing frames to GIF file.",
  "flows": "Mesh movement (translate) -> collision detection (collision method) -> update 'collisions' array -> write frame to GIF.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data sources; standard library usage; no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard collision detection visualization with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It uses well-documented libraries and functions, with straightforward logic. No anomalies or obfuscation are present. The collision detection and visualization are typical, and the code does not perform any external data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden actions. The 'collisions' mask is updated based on contact points, and frames are saved into a GIF. The code is benign and intended for demonstration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward visualization of mesh collision detection with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate a safe script, and the scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
