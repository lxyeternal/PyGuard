  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Sphinx extension for generating documentation galleries, reports, and visualizations. It contains no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the use of eval in _bool_eval, which is controlled and unlikely to be exploited. The overall security posture is very strong."
