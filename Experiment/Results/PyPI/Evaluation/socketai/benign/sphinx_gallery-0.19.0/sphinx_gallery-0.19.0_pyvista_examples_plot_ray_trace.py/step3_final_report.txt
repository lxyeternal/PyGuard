{
  "purpose": "The code performs a simple ray trace on a sphere and visualizes the sphere, the ray segment, and intersection points using PyVista.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded data: sphere geometry, start and stop points for the ray, and visualization parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, network operations, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded inputs through geometric computations to visualization; no external data or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library functions for geometric modeling and visualization. It creates a sphere, performs a ray trace between fixed points, and visualizes the scene. There are no external data inputs, network communications, or system modifications. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and employs common practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization example with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and 0 for security risk, are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
