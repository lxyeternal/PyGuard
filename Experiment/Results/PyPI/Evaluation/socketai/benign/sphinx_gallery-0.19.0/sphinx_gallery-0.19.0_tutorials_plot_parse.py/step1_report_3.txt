{
  "purpose": "This code provides an example and explanation of how to structure Python files with alternating text and code blocks for Sphinx-Gallery documentation.",
  "sources": "Reads are mainly from import statements (`numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`) and the `print` statement.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted. No output or external system calls are made that could leak data or execute malicious commands.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily demonstrates formatting and documentation structures without external input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious comments. The code is structured as an instructional example with no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of documentation, comments, import statements, function definitions, and print statements, all aligned with formatting instructions for Sphinx-Gallery. No external data is read from untrusted sources, and no harmful actions are performed. There are no signs of malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. The comments and structure indicate an educational purpose with no suspicious or malicious code embedded.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example demonstrating documentation and code-block structuring techniques for Sphinx-Gallery. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are detected.",
