  "purpose": "This code serves as an instructional example demonstrating how to structure Python scripts with alternating text and code blocks for Sphinx-Gallery, including syntax rules and edge cases.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from import statements (`numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`), comments, string literals, and variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs, external data sources, or data sinks that could lead to leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely structural and documentation-oriented without external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains unused import statements and documentation comments, but no suspicious or malicious constructs. String literals are for documentation only.",
  "analysis": "The script is a benign, educational example illustrating how to alternate text and code blocks in Python for Sphinx-Gallery. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The import statements are harmless, and the comments are for documentation purposes. No external data, network operations, or data processing of untrusted inputs are present. The code's structure and content do not suggest any security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, instructional example with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
