{
  "purpose": "The code appears to serve as a demonstration or tutorial on how to structure alternating text and code blocks for Sphinx-Gallery documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external or untrusted input; it only imports libraries (numpy, matplotlib) and contains inline comments and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; no external connections, file writes, or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted inputs; the script primarily contains static code and comments.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes comments about unsupported or problematic comment styles but does not contain malicious code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a structured example demonstrating how to use comments and syntax to organize code and text for Sphinx-Gallery documentation. It imports common plotting libraries but does not execute any harmful or sensitive operations. The comments point out potential pitfalls but do not implement any malicious behavior. No external data inputs or outputs are present. The code is mainly static and educational in nature.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, designed for documentation purposes, and does not contain any malicious or security-threatening behavior. It does not perform any data processing, external communications, or system modifications.",
