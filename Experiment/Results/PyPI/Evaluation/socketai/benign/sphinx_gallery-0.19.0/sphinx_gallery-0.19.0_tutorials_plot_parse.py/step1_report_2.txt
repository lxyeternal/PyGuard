{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a tutorial or documentation example demonstrating how to alternate text and code blocks in a Sphinx-Gallery compatible Python script.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`), inline comments, function definitions, print statements, string literals, and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted input or lead to data leaks; no code execution, network access, or data manipulation of untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flow identified. The code consists mainly of comments, documentation, and simple variable assignments with no interaction between sources and sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of string literals with no purpose other than documentation, and comments indicating unsupported or discouraged comment styles. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script contains multiple sections with comments, markdown-style documentation, and simple variable assignments. No external inputs are processed, no network operations or data leaks are evident. Import statements are unused (`np`, `plt`), but their presence alone isn't suspicious. The code includes explanations, code block separators, and documentation-style strings, indicating its role as an illustrative example rather than an executable malicious script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example illustrating documentation and code block structuring for Sphinx-Gallery. It contains no malicious behavior, no security vulnerabilities, and no suspicious activity. The structure and content are consistent with a documentation or educational purpose.",
