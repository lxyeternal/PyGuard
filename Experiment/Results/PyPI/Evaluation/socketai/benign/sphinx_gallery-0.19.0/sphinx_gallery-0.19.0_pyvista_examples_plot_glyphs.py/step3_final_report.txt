{
  "purpose": "The code performs scientific visualization using PyVista, creating glyphs, arrows, and plotting datasets loaded from open-source examples.",
  "sources": "Datasets loaded via pyvista's example functions, such as download_carotid(), load_random_hills(), and pv.Sphere(), as well as scalar and vector data defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "Visualization functions that render data locally; no external data transfer, network activity, or file exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading/manipulation to visualization functions like glyph(), arrows.plot(), and add_mesh(), all within local memory.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical scientific visualization script involving dataset loading, scalar/vector manipulation, glyph creation, and plotting. It does not contain any malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation. All operations are standard for visualization tasks, and no external data exfiltration or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence level is high (1), given the straightforward analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard visualization script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
