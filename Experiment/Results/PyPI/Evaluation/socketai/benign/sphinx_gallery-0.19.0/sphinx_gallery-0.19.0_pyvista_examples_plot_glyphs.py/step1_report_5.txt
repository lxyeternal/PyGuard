{
  "purpose": "The code is for visualizing vector fields and glyphs using the pyvista library, including loading sample datasets, manipulating vectors, and rendering plots.",
  "sources": "Download of example datasets (`download_carotid`, `load_random_hills`) and creation of vectors and mesh objects in the script.",
  "sinks": "Rendering functions (`pl.show()`, `p.show()`), mesh visualization, and plotting calls which display the visualizations.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded or generated, then processed or transformed (e.g., thresholding, vector manipulation), and finally visualized through plotting functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The script uses standard pyvista functions and numpy operations. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses open-source datasets from pyvista's example module, performs vector operations, and visualizes the data. No external input handling that could be exploited, nor any suspicious behavior such as network activity or file modifications. All library functions are legitimate and intended for visualization purposes. The script is consistent with typical scientific visualization workflows and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code. The presence of visualization code and sample data download functions is normal for such applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical example of scientific visualization using pyvista with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration, and its behavior is consistent with legitimate use.",
