{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates how to generate and visualize glyphs and vector fields using the PyVista library, including loading datasets, manipulating vectors, and plotting.",
  "sources": "The code reads datasets through 'examples.download_carotid()', 'examples.load_random_hills()', and 'pv.Sphere()'; it also reads vector data from 'mesh' and 'sphere' objects.",
  "sinks": "The visualization functions 'pl.show()' and 'p.show()' display the generated plots, but do not perform any data exfiltration or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from datasets -> processed or modified (e.g., thresholding, vector scaling) -> visualized through PyVista plotting functions; no untrusted input or data flow to external systems identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The code strictly performs data visualization and geometric operations with no hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script loads and processes 3D datasets and vector fields, modifies scalar and vector data for visualization, and plots the results. All operations are related to visualization using standard PyVista functions. No external data transmission, command execution, or system modification is observed. The code appears to be for demonstration or educational purposes, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard example of using PyVista for visualization of glyphs and vector fields. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious network activity, and no security risks. It is safe and intended for educational or visualization tasks.",
