  "purpose": "Utility functions for integrating Binder and JupyterLite with Sphinx-Gallery, including URL generation, static asset copying, configuration validation, and notebook modification.",
  "sources": "Filesystem paths, user configuration dictionaries, static SVG files, user-supplied notebook modification functions.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem (copying static assets and notebooks), URL strings, JSON files for notebooks.",
  "flows": "Configuration data and file paths flow into URL generation and file copying functions; user functions modify notebooks; static assets are copied from static directories to build directories.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or network activity; no obfuscation; user-provided functions for notebook modification could be malicious if misused, but this is an expected extension point.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem operations, URL construction, static asset management, and configuration validation. It relies on user-supplied functions for notebook modifications, which could be exploited if malicious, but this is a documented and controlled pattern. No suspicious code, backdoors, or network activity are present. The static SVG files are sourced from trusted static directories. The code is clear, straightforward, and uses common Python libraries without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility module for integrating Binder and JupyterLite into documentation workflows. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low security risk score reflects minimal inherent vulnerabilities, primarily related to user customization points. Overall, it is safe for use in production environments.",
