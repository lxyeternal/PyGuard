  "purpose": "Configure the number of GPUs to be used based on the model size for parallel processing.",
  "sources": "args.model_path (input parameter), environment variable 'CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'",
  "sinks": "os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] (sets GPU visibility for subsequent processes)",
  "flows": "Reads model size from args, reads environment variable 'CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES', modifies environment variable to set GPU devices",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded environment variable handling appears standard, no secret data or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The function extracts model size from a provided path, determines GPU count based on model size thresholds, and sets the 'CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES' environment variable accordingly. The environment variable is read and overwritten in a typical manner without obfuscation or hidden code. The logging statement has a minor issue: it uses comma instead of string formatting, but this does not affect security. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious data flows, or suspicious external calls. The code performs a standard resource allocation task for GPU management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for GPU allocation based on model size. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It is a typical setup function for machine learning workflows.",
