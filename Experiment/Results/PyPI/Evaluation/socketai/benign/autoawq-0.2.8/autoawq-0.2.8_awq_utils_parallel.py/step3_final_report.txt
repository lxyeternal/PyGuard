  "flows": "Parse model size from args.model_path -> determine n_gpu -> set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable",
  "anomalies": "Minor logging statement bug using comma instead of string formatting; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code extracts model size from a filename, determines GPU count based on size thresholds, and sets the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable accordingly. It performs standard resource allocation without network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. The only issue is a minor logging bug that does not impact security. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign GPU resource configuration utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The minor logging bug is non-security relevant. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
