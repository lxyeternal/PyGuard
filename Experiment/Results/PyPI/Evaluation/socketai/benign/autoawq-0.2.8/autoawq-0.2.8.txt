      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or obfuscated content. The only minor concern is reliance on an environment variable without validation, which could be exploited in an untrusted environment, but this does not constitute malicious behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing standard tensor quantization and packing routines used in neural network weight compression. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The minor risk associated with potential malicious input tensors is inherent to such routines but does not indicate malicious intent."

The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal concern, aligned with the benign analysis."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears predominantly benign with some suspicion in report 3 due to dynamic execution and hardcoded secrets. No active malware detected. Scores are consistent with the evidence; malware score remains at 0, obfuscation slightly elevated in report 3, and overall risk remains low. Further static/dynamic analysis is recommended if dynamic features are used extensively."

The security risk is minimal, primarily related to handling untrusted datasets, but no vulnerabilities are introduced by the code itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) is appropriate."

It relies on common libraries and practices, with no signs of sabotage or obfuscation. The low security risk primarily stems from fetching data from potentially untrusted URLs, which is standard in such contexts."
