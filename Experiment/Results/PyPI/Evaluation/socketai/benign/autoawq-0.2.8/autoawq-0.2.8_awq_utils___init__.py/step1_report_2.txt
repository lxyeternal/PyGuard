  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs data processing or computation tasks, possibly involving external input.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, configuration files, or external data sources (if any are present).",
  "sinks": "Potential output functions, network calls, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks, with specific attention to untrusted data paths.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, or suspicious variable names. Look for suspicious network activity or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code has been examined for common security issues, such as injection points, data leaks, or backdoors. No obvious malicious patterns are detected. Usage of third-party libraries is standard, with no evidence of malicious code. The code structure is typical and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network connections are apparent. The code appears benign and consistent with normal data processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The code appears to be a legitimate Python script performing standard functions. The overall security risk is low.",
