  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment variables, input data, environment, files, and network resources.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through environment variables, network connections, or file writes; dynamic execution points (eval/exec) as potential sinks for malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into eval/exec or network functions, which could lead to malicious actions if untrusted data is executed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation hints, dynamic code execution, and suspicious imports or network calls in some reports.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate benign code with no active malicious payloads. Report 3 notes suspicious features like eval/exec and hardcoded secrets, which justify moderate suspicion but no confirmed malware. Confidence scores align with the evidence; obfuscation is only suspected in report 3. The overall security risk remains low, with scores reflecting minimal threat. The code's structure and signals suggest low likelihood of active malicious behavior, but dynamic execution features warrant cautious monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears predominantly benign with some suspicion in report 3 due to dynamic execution and hardcoded secrets. No active malware detected. Scores are consistent with the evidence; malware score remains at 0, obfuscation slightly elevated in report 3, and overall risk remains low. Further static/dynamic analysis is recommended if dynamic features are used extensively.",
