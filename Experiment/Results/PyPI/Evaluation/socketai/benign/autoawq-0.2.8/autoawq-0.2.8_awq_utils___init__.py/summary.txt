  "obfuscated": 0.2,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code appears predominantly benign with some suspicion in report 3 due to dynamic execution and hardcoded secrets. No active malware detected. Scores are consistent with the evidence; malware score remains at 0, obfuscation slightly elevated in report 3, and overall risk remains low. Further static/dynamic analysis is recommended if dynamic features are used extensively."
