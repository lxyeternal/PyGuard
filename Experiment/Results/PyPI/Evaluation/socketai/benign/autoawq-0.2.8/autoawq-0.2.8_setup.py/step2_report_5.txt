  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify their claims, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Correctly identifies that the script is a standard setup.py, with no suspicious code or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** The environment variable is used solely for dependency versioning, which is common practice. No code injection or malicious activity detected.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the standard nature of the script. Notes potential concern about using environment variables without validation but considers it not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — slightly elevated risk score.\n- **Justification:** The small risk score reflects the potential for environment variable manipulation, but this is typical in setup scripts and not inherently malicious.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. No malicious intent, but environment variable reliance warrants cautious deployment in untrusted environments.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Reiterates that the script is standard, with no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion—standard setup script, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, no issues detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code is a typical setup.py script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated in Report 2 (0.1) due to reliance on environment variables without validation, but this is a common pattern and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code does not perform any network activity, code injection, or malicious operations.\n- Usage of environment variables for dependency versions is standard, though it could be misused in malicious contexts, but there's no evidence here.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious logic detected.\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to environment variable usage without validation, but not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The package setup script is standard, with no malicious intent or security risks. The minor risk score reflects typical concerns about environment variable reliance but does not indicate actual vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on this analysis, I would agree with the existing scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.",
