  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard setup.py script with no suspicious behavior. The environment variable 'TORCH_VERSION' is used to specify the dependency version, which is common practice.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, appropriate given the lack of issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the environment variable usage. Slight concern about potential manipulation of 'TORCH_VERSION', but it's a typical pattern.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both 0, consistent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — a minimal potential risk if environment variables are manipulated, but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable; no malicious intent, just a note on potential environmental manipulation.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard setup script with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Standard setup script, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others, standard setup with environment variable dependency.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Most are 0; one is 0.1 due to environmental variable use, which is acceptable.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical Python setup script for packaging, with no malicious intent.\n- Use of environment variables for versioning is common, though it could be manipulated in an insecure environment, but that doesn't constitute malware.\n- No suspicious network activity, code injection, or obfuscation.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal potential risk due to environment variable manipulation, but not malicious)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and free from malicious or obfuscated content. The small risk score accounts for environmental manipulation potential but doesn't indicate actual malicious intent.",
