  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'autoawq' Python project, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'TORCH_VERSION', reading 'README.md' file for long description, package requirements, and standard import statements.",
  "sinks": "Reading environment variable 'TORCH_VERSION', reading file content for long description, defining package dependencies, calling setup() function for package installation.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'TORCH_VERSION' -> used in requirements list; 'README.md' content -> used in long_description; setup() call -> installs dependencies and packages.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable 'TORCH_VERSION' without validation could allow injection if manipulated, but in this context it’s used for version specification only. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. The code is standard setup.py with dependency specification.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package. It reads the version info from an environment variable or the installed torch version, reads a README file for description, and specifies dependencies for package installation. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no suspicious logic, and no obfuscated code. Use of environment variables for versioning is common, although it could potentially be manipulated in an insecure environment, but this is not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears to serve its purpose without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging Python code. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages package metadata and dependencies, with some environment variable usage that is typical in such scripts.",
