{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package for distribution, specifying metadata, dependencies, and package details.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'TORCH_VERSION', file 'README.md', and package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data outputs or external communications.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'TORCH_VERSION' influences the 'requirements' list; reading of README.md for long description.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hidden functionalities; standard setup script. Uses environment variable to determine package version dependency, which is common.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, retrieves torch version from environment or library, constructs setup configuration with metadata, dependencies, and extras. No code injection, network activity, or suspicious logic detected. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent. It handles package metadata and dependencies securely and normally.",
