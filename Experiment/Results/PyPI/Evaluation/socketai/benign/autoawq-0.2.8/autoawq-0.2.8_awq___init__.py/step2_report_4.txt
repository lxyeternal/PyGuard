  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code snippet: setting a version string and importing a class from an external library.\n- No data flows, input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The code appears to be a standard dependency declaration or module setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues and code presence:\n- The code snippet is straightforward and matches the described purpose: defining a version and importing a class.\n- No issues are present; the code is benign.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws are evident.\n- The reasoning that this is a standard setup code and not malicious is correct.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified given the simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct. The code is benign.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- Since no malicious activity is indicated, malware scores of 0 are justified.\n- The code only imports a class; no malicious behavior is suggested.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The assumption that importing a class from a library is harmless is valid here.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are necessary; the code is clearly part of a larger ML project.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is entirely benign, standard for dependency declaration in a machine learning project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The reports are accurate and consistent.  \n- The code is straightforward and safe.  \n- No changes to scores are necessary.",
