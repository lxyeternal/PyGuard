{
  "purpose": "Import a specific model class from a package, likely for machine learning or AI inference.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'awq.models.auto' and imports 'AutoAWQForCausalLM'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or output; the code simply sets a version and imports a class.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and imports a class from an external library. No suspicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior, is evident. The imported class could be used later in the program for AI tasks, but as-is, it does not indicate malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, straightforward module import with a version identifier. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security concerns in this snippet.",
