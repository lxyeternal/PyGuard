{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set a version identifier and import a specific model class from an external library, likely for machine learning or AI inference tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the __version__ variable and imports from the module awq.models.auto.",
  "sinks": "The import statement loads external code; no direct sink for untrusted data is evident.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows are present in this snippet, as it only defines a version and imports a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, setting a version string and importing a specific class from a package. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, or suspicious behaviors. The import is from a known package structure, and the version string appears standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving likely as part of a larger module to specify version and import a model class. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this fragment.",
