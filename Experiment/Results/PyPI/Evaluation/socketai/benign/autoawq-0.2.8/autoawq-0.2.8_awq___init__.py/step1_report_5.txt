{
  "purpose": "Define the version of the package and import a specific model class from the awq library.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' and the import statement 'from awq.models.auto import AutoAWQForCausalLM'.",
  "sinks": "The import statement potentially loads external code or dependencies, but does not execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident; the code only sets a version string and performs a static import.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares a version string and imports a class from an external module. No data input handling, network communication, or dynamic code execution occurs. The import appears to be for a machine learning model component from a library named 'awq'. The minimal code does not indicate malicious intent or behavior; it is a typical package setup snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to specify the package version and import a class. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
