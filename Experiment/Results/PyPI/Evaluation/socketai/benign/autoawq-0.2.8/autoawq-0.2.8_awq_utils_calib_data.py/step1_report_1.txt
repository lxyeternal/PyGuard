{
  "purpose": "The code loads and preprocesses datasets for calibration purposes, specifically for tokenizing and splitting text data into fixed-length sequences.",
  "sources": "Dataset loading via load_dataset (Hugging Face), input data parameter, and tokenizer.encode method.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly write to or transmit data to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Input data is loaded or received, then tokenized and encoded, followed by concatenation and splitting into fixed-size chunks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code processes data normally and does not include obfuscated or malicious constructs. No suspicious network activity or system modification is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code loads datasets either from Hugging Face datasets or from provided lists, then processes each data sample by stripping, encoding via a tokenizer, and filtering by sequence length. It concatenates encoded samples and splits them into fixed-length chunks for further use. The operations are typical for data preprocessing in NLP pipelines. No hidden or malicious code patterns detected; the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose with standard libraries and functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate dataset loading and tokenization tasks without any indication of malicious intent or security risks. It handles data securely, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.",
