{
  "purpose": "The code loads and preprocesses datasets for calibration purposes, specifically preparing tokenized text samples for use in models or evaluations.",
  "sources": "Input dataset sources via the 'load_dataset' function, user-provided data list, and tokenizer.encode output.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage if dataset contains sensitive data, or if untrusted input is used in the tokenizer or dataset loading. No external network or sensitive info leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input dataset or data list flows into tokenization or list processing, then into tensor creation, concatenation, and splitting into fixed-length segments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of 'load_dataset' is standard for dataset loading. No obfuscated code detected. No unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads datasets from known sources or user-provided data, processes text by tokenization, and prepares fixed-length tensor segments. It uses standard libraries and functions without any suspicious or malicious calls. No network access or system modifications are performed. The code appears to be straightforward data preprocessing for model calibration. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dataset preprocessing function intended for calibration data preparation. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
