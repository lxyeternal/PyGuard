  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to handling untrusted datasets, but no vulnerabilities are introduced by the code itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) is appropriate."
