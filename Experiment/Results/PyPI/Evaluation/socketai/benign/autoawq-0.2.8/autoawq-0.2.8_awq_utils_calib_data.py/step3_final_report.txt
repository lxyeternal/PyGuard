  "purpose": "Load and preprocess datasets for calibration, including tokenization, filtering, concatenation, and splitting into fixed-length chunks.",
  "sources": "Dataset loading via load_dataset, tokenizer.encode, reading text from dataset entries.",
  "sinks": "Tensor concatenation and splitting; no external data transmission or network activity.",
  "flows": "Dataset data flows through tokenization, encoding, filtering, concatenation, and splitting into chunks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard NLP data preprocessing: loading datasets, tokenizing, filtering sequences exceeding max length, concatenating samples into a tensor, and splitting into fixed-size chunks. It uses common libraries and practices without obfuscation or malicious patterns. No network activity, data exfiltration, or hardcoded credentials are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical data preparation routines for language modeling tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to handling untrusted datasets, but no vulnerabilities are introduced by the code itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) is appropriate.",
