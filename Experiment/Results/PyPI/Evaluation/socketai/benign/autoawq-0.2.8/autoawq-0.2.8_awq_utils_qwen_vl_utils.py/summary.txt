  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard media processing utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on common libraries and practices, with no signs of sabotage or obfuscation. The low security risk primarily stems from fetching data from potentially untrusted URLs, which is standard in such contexts."
