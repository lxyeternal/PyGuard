{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to fetch, resize, and process images and videos from various sources such as URLs, local files, base64 data, or in-memory objects, supporting media preprocessing for models.",
  "sources": "Network requests via requests.get for URLs, file I/O for local paths, base64 decoding, and PIL.Image object handling.",
  "sinks": "Image and video processing functions, resizing, sampling, and tensor conversion; no external data leaks or malicious sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Input sources (URLs, files, base64, images) flow into fetch_image() or fetch_video(), which process and output images or tensors for further use.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Environment variables control backend selection, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries (requests, PIL, torch, torchvision) for media handling. It performs typical operations such as fetching images, resizing, sampling frames, and reading videos via torchvision or decord. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious network activity is present. The network requests are typical for media pipelines, and environment variables are used for configuration. The code structure is clear and well-documented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard media processing utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on common libraries and practices, with no signs of sabotage or obfuscation. The low security risk primarily stems from fetching data from potentially untrusted URLs, which is standard in such contexts.",
