{
  "purpose": "This code initializes an AWS CDK module for AWS CodeGuru Profiler by importing necessary modules, loading a JSII assembly, and publishing metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements, __jsii_assembly__.load() call, publication.publish()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or data exfiltration observed",
  "flows": "Imports → assembly load → publish; no data flows to external systems",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; reliance on external assembly is standard but could be a supply chain concern",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for an AWS CDK construct, involving standard imports, assembly loading, and publishing. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The assembly load is typical in JSII-based projects and does not execute malicious code by itself. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate given the context. The dependency on external assemblies is a known supply chain consideration but not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard boilerplate for AWS CDK modules, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The slight security risk score reflects dependency trust issues but does not represent an actual threat.",
