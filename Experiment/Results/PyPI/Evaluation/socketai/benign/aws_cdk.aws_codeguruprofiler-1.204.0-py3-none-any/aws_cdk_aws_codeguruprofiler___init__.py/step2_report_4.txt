  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence presented, the logical consistency, and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes resource classes and properties for AWS CodeGuru Profiler in CDK, with input parameters and type hints.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious actions; permission grants and attribute access are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. Uses standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Very low security risk, legitimate resource definition.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard infrastructure-as-code, with no malicious behavior. The malware score is appropriately 0, and risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar overview, focusing on resource creation and management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external network or untrusted data flow; permissions are managed via standard methods.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No backdoors, secrets, or obfuscation. Code adheres to SDK patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard CDK resource code, malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines resources, attributes, and interfaces for profiling groups.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or malicious actions; resource creation via jsii is standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation; standard resource modeling.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, low security risk, malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; the code is typical for AWS CDK constructs.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on resource and permission management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Permission grants are typical; no external data flow or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets or backdoors; code structure standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with no malicious indicators; malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid; standard resource management code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar class and resource definitions, with standard patterns.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external network or malicious behavior; resource creation and property access are normal.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or suspicious code; consistent with open-source SDK patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports confirm that the code is standard AWS CDK resource definitions for CodeGuru Profiler.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None noted; the logic and structure are consistent with SDK and IaC patterns.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n  - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n  - **Risk:** The overall risk is very low, with scores around 0.1 to 0.2, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, due to permission management and resource configuration, but no actual security threat.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured AWS CDK library for managing CodeGuru Profiler profiling groups. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The reported scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed review of specific sections or potential security considerations beyond static code analysis.",
