{
  "purpose": "Defines AWS CodeGuru Profiler resource classes, properties, and permission management methods within AWS CDK, enabling infrastructure as code deployment of profiling groups.",
  "sources": "Resource creation parameters, property getters/setters, permission grant methods, attribute accessors.",
  "sinks": "No external data flows, network activity, or untrusted data handling; permission grants are standard IAM resource controls.",
  "flows": "Resource instantiation and attribute retrieval follow standard patterns; no malicious or suspicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs; code adheres to typical SDK and IaC patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code models AWS resources for CodeGuru Profiler using standard CDK constructs, with proper type hints and resource attributes. Permission methods grant access in a controlled manner. No signs of malicious logic, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is static, well-structured, and follows best practices for infrastructure as code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard AWS CDK library for managing CodeGuru Profiler profiling groups. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1). It is safe for deployment and use.",
