{
  "purpose": "The code defines AWS CloudFormation resources and constructs for managing CodeGuru Profiler profiling groups within AWS CDK, including resource classes, properties, and interfaces.",
  "sources": "Data inputs from class constructors, property setters, and imported modules such as AWS CDK core and IAM.",
  "sinks": "Methods that create or modify AWS resources, such as jsii.create() and jsii.invoke(), which generate CloudFormation templates; no direct data leaks or external network calls observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization of resource objects with parameters, setting properties, and invoking jsii methods to render CloudFormation templates; no external data flow outside AWS resource provisioning processes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors. The code strictly adheres to AWS CDK resource definitions for profiling groups. No obfuscated code or unusual runtime behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises type-safe class and data type definitions for AWS CloudFormation resources related to CodeGuru Profiler. It uses jsii for cross-language interoperability and includes standard patterns for AWS CDK resource constructs, such as property validation, resource creation, and interface implementation. There are no signs of malicious logic, external network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code serves as a standard infrastructure-as-code library for managing AWS profiling groups with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard AWS CDK library for defining CodeGuru Profiler resources, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is designed solely for infrastructure management and does not contain any malware or security risks.",
