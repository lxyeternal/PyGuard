{
  "purpose": "The code defines AWS CloudFormation constructs for managing AWS CodeGuru Profiler profiling groups, including resource classes, properties, and enums for configuring profiling groups in AWS CDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from constructor parameters, type hints, and property getters for resource configuration such as profiling group names, permissions, compute platform, and tags.",
  "sinks": "The code exposes properties and methods that could potentially be misused if inputs are untrusted, such as grant_publish and grant_read methods that assign permissions. No direct data leaks or malicious actions are evident. The code also retrieves resource attributes like ARNs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., profiling group name, permissions) flow into resource constructors and property setters. Permission grant methods modify IAM policies for principals. Attribute getters access resource attributes such as ARNs. No external network communication or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive type hints and property accessors but no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obscure code. No backdoors, code injection, or suspicious logic are present. The code strictly adheres to AWS CDK resource modeling patterns. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard AWS CDK constructs for AWS CodeGuru Profiler profiling groups, including resource classes, properties, and permission management methods. It uses type hints and property accessors appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. All data flows are within expected infrastructure-as-code patterns. The code appears legitimate, focusing on resource configuration and permission grants. No suspicious code paths or obfuscated logic identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard AWS CDK resource definition for CodeGuru Profiler profiling groups. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is very low. It is safe to use within an IaC deployment context.",
