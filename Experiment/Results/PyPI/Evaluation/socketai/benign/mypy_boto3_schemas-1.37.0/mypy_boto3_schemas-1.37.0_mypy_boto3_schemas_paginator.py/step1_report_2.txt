{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the boto3 'schemas' service client, enabling type-safe pagination over various schema-related API calls.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and internal type_defs modules; class methods accessing request parameters.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data being written or sent to external endpoints or storage; only class definitions and type annotations.",
  "flows": "User code calls 'get_paginator', which invokes 'paginate' methods passing in kwargs that are type-annotated. These methods return PageIterator objects. No untrusted data processing is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscated logic, hardcoded secrets, or unusual control flow. The code appears to be standard for boto3 paginator type stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type-annotated paginator classes for boto3's schemas client. It imports necessary modules and defines classes that extend Paginator with specified response types. The 'paginate' methods are properly annotated and include docstrings linking to documentation. Conditional imports handle compatibility with different Python versions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is straightforward, intended for type checking and documentation purposes, and does not process or handle untrusted data directly.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard set of type annotations and class definitions for boto3 paginators. No malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. It is safe and purely structural for type safety and documentation.",
