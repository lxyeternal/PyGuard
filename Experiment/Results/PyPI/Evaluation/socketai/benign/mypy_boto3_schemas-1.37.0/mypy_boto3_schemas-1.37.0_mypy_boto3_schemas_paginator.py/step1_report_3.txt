{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and paginator class definitions for the boto3 schemas service client, facilitating type-safe pagination support.",
  "sources": "Imports from system modules (sys, typing), third-party modules (botocore.paginate), and local type definitions from .type_defs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted input or data that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "The code flows from type definitions and base class inheritance to class method definitions for paginating responses, with no data transformations or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward, with clear class and method structures.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly provides type annotations and class structures for paginators, relying on external libraries (botocore, typing_extensions). It uses conditional type imports for compatibility. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data handling that could be malicious are included. The code adheres to standard practices for type annotations and class definitions. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, focusing on type annotations for boto3 paginator classes, with no malicious behavior detected. It appears to be safe and intended for type safety support in a larger codebase.",
