  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the boto3 'schemas' service client, facilitating paginated API calls with type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'botocore.paginate', type definitions from '.type_defs', and the methods 'paginate' in each paginator class, which accept keyword arguments.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods receive '**kwargs' which are unpacked and passed to the underlying 'PageIterator' methods. No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in the code itself.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the 'paginate' method receiving '**kwargs' of specific types, unpacking these, and passing them to the base 'Paginator' class, returning a 'PageIterator' of response types.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code structure is standard for type annotation purposes. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external data fetching is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginators for the boto3 'schemas' client with type annotations, ensuring type safety. It correctly differentiates behavior based on Python version for 'Unpack' imports. No external or untrusted data sources or sinks are involved. The 'paginate' methods correctly accept typed parameters and return paginated response iterators. The use of 'if TYPE_CHECKING' is standard for typing imports. Overall, the code appears clean, standard, and focused on type annotations without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of paginator classes with type annotations for a boto3 client, intended to facilitate paginated API calls safely. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and serves purely as type safety tooling.",
