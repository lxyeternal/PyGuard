  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for boto3's schemas service client, providing static type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Methods like 'paginate' accepting '**kwargs' unpacked from specific request type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data processing; purely class and method signatures for static typing.",
  "flows": "Unpack request kwargs in 'paginate' methods, passing them to the base 'Paginator' class, returning 'PageIterator' objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for paginators with type annotations, conditional imports for compatibility, and straightforward method signatures. It does not process data, execute external commands, or handle untrusted input. The structure aligns with standard SDK stub patterns, serving solely for type safety and documentation. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of type annotations and class definitions for boto3's schemas client paginators. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The implementation is safe and purely structural.",
