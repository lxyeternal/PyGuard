  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for AWS Schemas service client, providing type hints for paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to 'paginate' with **kwargs unpacking, which pass user-supplied parameters into paginator methods.",
  "flows": "User calls 'paginate' with arbitrary keyword arguments, which are unpacked into paginator method calls; no data flows from untrusted sources directly into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors present. The code appears standard for type annotations and paginator class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for AWS Schemas service with detailed type annotations. It dynamically assigns base classes based on Python version, uses type checking for static typing, and provides method signatures with proper type hints. There are no external data sources, malicious data flows, or suspicious code behaviors. The code strictly serves as a type hinting aid for boto3 paginator interfaces and does not perform any runtime data processing or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of paginator class definitions with type annotations, and it shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as a type hinting layer for boto3 AWS SDK.",
