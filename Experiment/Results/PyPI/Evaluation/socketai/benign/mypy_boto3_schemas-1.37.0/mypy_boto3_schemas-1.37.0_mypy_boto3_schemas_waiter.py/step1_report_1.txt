  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definition for a specific AWS Schemas waiter used in boto3 client.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs module; no external data input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network, file, or system commands; no untrusted data outputs identified.",
  "flows": "Code flow involves class inheritance and method definition with type annotations; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior. The code appears to be straightforward documentation and class extension for AWS SDK.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of botocore.waiter.Waiter with a type-annotated wait method, utilizing conditional imports based on Python version. No dynamic code execution, no data leaks, and no suspicious operations detected. The code serves as a type-stub for AWS waiters, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type annotation and subclass extension for AWS boto3 waiters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a well-structured SDK helper module with no anomalies.",
