  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the code's security posture, scores, and any inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward subclass of `botocore.waiter.Waiter`, with type annotations and documentation links. No suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code content. The code is purely for type annotations and class extension, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with a focus on the wait() method accepting parameters typed by `DescribeCodeBindingRequestWaitTypeDef`. No dangerous actions observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk is set to 0.1, citing the unpacking of parameters. Since the method does not process or execute these parameters, and there's no external activity, this risk score seems slightly overestimated.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce securityRisk to 0, as no actual risk is present. The unpacking is just type annotation, not a security concern.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are slightly inflated; should be 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines a subclass with a wait() method accepting unpacked request parameters. No malicious behavior or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is purely for type annotations and class structure.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with focus on the class and method structure, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Again, the unpacking of parameters does not introduce security risks. The score should be 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Reduce securityRisk to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign class extension with no suspicious features.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, matching the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight overestimation in reports 2 and 4 (0.1). The code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks. The unpacking of parameters is purely for type annotations and does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Security Risk:** Should be 0 for all, as no actual risk is present.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a well-structured, type-annotated extension for AWS boto3 waiters, serving documentation and type checking purposes. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign nature and the analysis provided.",
