{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and a class wrapper for a boto3 waiters interface related to the schemas service, specifically for waiting on the 'code_binding_exists' condition.",
  "sources": "Import of sys for Python version check, import of Waiter class from botocore.waiter, and type definitions from .type_defs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily defines a class and method with static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated code detected. Use of sys.version_info for version checking is standard. The code is solely a type annotation and class extension for boto3 waiters.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, performs a version check to import Unpack from appropriate typing module, and defines a subclass of boto3's Waiter with a wait method that accepts unpacked request parameters. The code includes docstrings linking to boto3 and botocore documentation. No dynamic code execution, external network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The code appears to be straightforward, intended to provide type annotations and structure for AWS schemas waiters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type annotation and class extension for boto3 waiters, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves a utility purpose without performing any untrusted or harmful actions.",
