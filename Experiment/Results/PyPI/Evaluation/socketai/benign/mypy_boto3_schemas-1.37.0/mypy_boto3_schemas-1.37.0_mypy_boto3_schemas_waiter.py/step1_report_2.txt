  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definition for a SchemasClient waiter in boto3, facilitating waiting for a specific AWS schemas operation to complete.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs module; class method wait() which accepts parameters defined by DescribeCodeBindingRequestWaitTypeDef.",
  "sinks": "The wait() method receives arbitrary keyword arguments unpacked from DescribeCodeBindingRequestWaitTypeDef, but does not perform any dangerous actions like executing system commands or network calls directly.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to wait() are accepted from the caller and unpacked into the method, but the method implementation calls the parent class Waiter's wait() without additional data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is primarily type annotations and class inheritance with documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Waiter with a wait() method that accepts parameters typed by DescribeCodeBindingRequestWaitTypeDef. The method does not contain logic beyond calling the parent class, indicating standard implementation. No input/output data flows suggest malicious manipulation. Import statements are standard, with conditional import for typing_extensions based on Python version, which is normal practice. No signs of code injection, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type-annotated subclass for AWS SDK waiters with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It serves a documentation and typing purpose without executing unsafe operations or data leaks.",
