  "purpose": "Type annotations and class extension for AWS boto3 waiters, providing type hints and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries, conditional import for Unpack, and class inheritance; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, external communication, or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Parameters unpacked in wait() method are only used for type annotations; no data flow leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; use of sys.version_info for compatibility is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward subclass of botocore.waiter.Waiter with type annotations and documentation. It accepts parameters via unpacking but does not process or execute untrusted data. No dynamic code, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The minimal risk scores (0 or 0.1) assigned in reports are justified, as the code only serves as a type stub and helper.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a type annotation helper for AWS SDK waiters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
