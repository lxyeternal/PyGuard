  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and evaluate the security implications, scores, and potential anomalies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes type annotations and class definition, no external data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or dangerous operations.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, serving as a type stub for AWS waiters. No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — correct.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n- Risk: 0 — appropriate, given no security concerns.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully benign. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; defines a waiter class with type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous operations; accepts parameters but doesn't execute unsafe code.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard subclass with no malicious logic; mainly type annotations.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — correct.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n- Risk: 0.1 — slightly above zero, justified by the mention of potential security risk, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**Justification for securityRisk=0.1:**  \nThe score reflects a minimal concern due to the presence of a wait method accepting parameters. However, since no dangerous operations are performed, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar to others, defines a class with documentation links.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or external commands.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of sys.version_info for conditional import is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; utility for type annotations.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n- Risk: 0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; defines a class with documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Straightforward, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — correct.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n- Risk: 0.1 — consistent with previous reports, given the minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar pattern.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, utility-focused code.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n- Risk: 0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to the presence of methods accepting parameters, but no actual security risk exists.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n- The code is a benign, well-structured SDK helper module with no security issues.\n- No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk:** 0 — the code is purely for type annotations and class extension, with no security implications.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, with scores appropriately assigned. It functions as intended for SDK type annotations, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
