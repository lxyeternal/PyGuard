  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for schemas service client waiters, specifically for the CodeBindingExistsWaiter class.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules (__future__, sys, botocore.waiter, and .type_defs). It does not read external or untrusted input sources at runtime.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted. The code mainly defines a subclass and a method signature.",
  "flows": "The flow involves type hinting for the wait() method with unpacked request types, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward type annotation and class extension without any obfuscated constructs or suspicious logic. The license comment mentions a future year (2025) but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Waiter with a method wait() that accepts parameters matching DescribeCodeBindingRequestWaitTypeDef. It uses conditional imports for typing extensions based on Python version. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type annotation and class extension for a boto3 waiters module. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident. It appears to be a legitimate part of a typed boto3 client library.",
