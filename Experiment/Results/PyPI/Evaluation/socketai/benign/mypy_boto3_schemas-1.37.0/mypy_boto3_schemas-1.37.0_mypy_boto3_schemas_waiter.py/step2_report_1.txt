  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of class definitions extending `botocore.waiter.Waiter` with type annotations, designed to provide better type hints for AWS SDK waiters.\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code involves conditional imports for compatibility (`Unpack` from `typing_extensions`), which is standard practice.\n- No external data input, network activity, or system commands are present.\n- The purpose is to serve as type annotations and class wrappers, not to execute logic or handle untrusted data.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis per report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for a schemas waiter.\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no risk)\n- **Malware score:** 0 (benign)\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is documentation and class extension, with no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for a SchemasClient waiter.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** The report notes the method accepts arbitrary kwargs unpacked from a type-def but does not perform dangerous actions. The minimal risk score (0.1) seems appropriate given the absence of actual logic or data processing.\n- **Justification for risk:** Since the method only calls the parent `wait()` with no additional logic, the risk remains very low.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep the risk score at 0.1, as it reflects a very low but non-zero potential if future modifications introduce issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for schemas service waiter.\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Similar to others, straightforward class extension with documentation links. No suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for schemas waiter class.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Same reasoning as previous reports; no dangerous operations.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for a boto3 Schemas waiter.\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with others, no suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk:** Most assign 0, with some at 0.1, reflecting very low potential risk due to the method accepting arbitrary kwargs but not executing any malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured type stub for AWS waiters.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The minor risk scores (0.1) are justified by the fact that the method accepts arbitrary parameters, which could potentially be misused if extended improperly, but in the current state, the risk remains negligible.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.05 to 0.1 (very low, justified by the acceptance of arbitrary kwargs but no actual malicious activity)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, serving as a type annotation helper for AWS SDK waiters, with no security risks. The existing scores are reasonable, though I would suggest keeping the risk score at 0.1 or lower, reflecting the minimal potential for misuse if parameters are misused.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes to the scores are necessary; the reports are consistent and accurate based on the code provided.",
