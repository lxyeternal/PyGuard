  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for a boto3 Schemas client waiter, facilitating waiting for a specific resource state.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type definitions. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the wait method accepts parameters but does not process or transmit data externally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code features detected. The code is straightforward, focusing on type annotations and class structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Waiter for a specific resource wait condition in AWS. It imports necessary modules securely, uses conditional imports for compatibility, and provides documentation links. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. The wait method is a simple override with type annotations, without executing external code or handling sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured module for AWS boto3 waiters with no malicious intent. It primarily serves as a type-annotated extension of botocore.waiter, with no security risks identified.",
