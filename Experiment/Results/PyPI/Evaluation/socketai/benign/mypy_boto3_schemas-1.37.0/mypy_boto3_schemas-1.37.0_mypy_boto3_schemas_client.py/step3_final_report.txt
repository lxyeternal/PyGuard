  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for AWS Schemas client SDK, serving as a static stub with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "Method signatures, type annotations, property definitions, and documentation links; no runtime data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, URL generation, or external calls occur within this static interface.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only method signatures and type hints without runtime execution.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard SDK stub structure with no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, auto-generated SDK interface with method signatures, type annotations, and documentation. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks are present. The minimal security risk scores assigned in the original reports are justified; the code is purely structural and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured SDK interface for AWS Schemas with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its nature, and the scores should be set to malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 for an accurate security assessment.",
