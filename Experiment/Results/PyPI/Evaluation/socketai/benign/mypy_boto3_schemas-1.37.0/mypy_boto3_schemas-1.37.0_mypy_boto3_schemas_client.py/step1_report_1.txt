  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS Schemas service, providing a structured way to interact with the service API.",
  "sources": "The code imports various type definitions, the sys module for version checks, and boto3 and botocore classes and exceptions. It does not read external input directly.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or write data to external systems. It mainly defines a class interface and type annotations.",
  "flows": "The code provides method signatures for API calls but does not implement data flows or logic that handle untrusted input; it primarily defines API method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The code is mainly type annotations, class definitions, and method signatures aligned with boto3 standards.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'SchemasClient' with method signatures matching AWS SDK operations, including paginator and waiter methods, with proper type annotations. It imports necessary modules conditionally based on Python version. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is present. The code serves as a type-safe interface for AWS Schemas client.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured type annotation and interface definition for AWS Schemas SDK client. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious SDK interface definition.",
