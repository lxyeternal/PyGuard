{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the boto3 Schemas service, facilitating static type checking and improved developer experience.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class and method definitions; property and overload decorators.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; functions mainly define interfaces, type annotations, and documentation links.",
  "flows": "No execution flow of untrusted data; the code mainly sets up class interfaces and type annotations without dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `Unpack` for type hinting; property `exceptions` is defined but lacks implementation; extensive type annotation usage; no actual logic or data processing; docstrings link to documentation; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive type-annotated interface layer for the boto3 Schemas client, with no executable logic or data processing. It defines class properties, method signatures, overloads for paginators and waiters, and documentation links. There are no signs of code injection, data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behavior. Use of type hints like `Unpack` and `Literal` are standard for static typing support. The property `exceptions` is declared but not implemented here, indicating interface definition only. No hardcoded credentials or malicious instructions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a purely structural and type annotation definition for the boto3 Schemas client. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as an interface layer to improve static analysis and IDE support, with no signs of sabotage, malware, or security threats.",
