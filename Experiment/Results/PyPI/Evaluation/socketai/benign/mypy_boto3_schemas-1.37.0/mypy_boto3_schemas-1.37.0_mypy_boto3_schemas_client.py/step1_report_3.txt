{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS Schemas service, providing structured method signatures for interacting with the service.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class and method definitions; property and method signatures.",
  "sinks": "Methods accepting **kwargs unpacked from type definitions, which typically contain request parameters; no direct untrusted input sources or data leakage points are evident.",
  "flows": "Method calls accepting unpacked parameters lead to AWS API requests; no evidence of data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within the code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments detected. Use of dynamic typing and method overloads is standard for boto3 stubs and SDKs; no obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a stub interface defining a client for AWS Schemas service with type annotations. It leverages standard Python typing, boto3, and botocore structures, including method overloads for paginators and waiters. No malicious code or behavior, such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors, is present. The code appears to be auto-generated or boilerplate for SDK bindings, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface with no indicators of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It functions as a type-annotated wrapper for AWS Schemas API operations, with no suspicious or malicious logic detected.",
