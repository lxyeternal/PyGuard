  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-schemas package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup from setuptools, and defining package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs detected.",
  "flows": "Reading file content for description, then passing static configuration data to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors identified. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and reads a local README.md file for description content. It then calls setup() with static, hardcoded package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are used. The code structure follows standard Python packaging practices. No signs of malicious code or supply chain attacks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies. The code appears safe and intended solely for package configuration.",
