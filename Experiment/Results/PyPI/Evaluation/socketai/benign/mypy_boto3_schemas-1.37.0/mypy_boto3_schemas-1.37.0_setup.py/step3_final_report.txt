{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the mypy-boto3-schemas Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata and dependencies defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "Static data from local file and hardcoded metadata used directly in setup() call; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup configuration script using setuptools. It reads a local README file for description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs explicitly. No dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or external data processing is present. All signals indicate benign, standard package setup code with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's static and transparent nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign Python package setup file with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. All reports accurately reflect this assessment, and the scores are justified.",
