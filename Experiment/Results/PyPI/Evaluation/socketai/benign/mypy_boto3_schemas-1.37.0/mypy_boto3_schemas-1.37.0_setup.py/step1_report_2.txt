{
  "purpose": "This setup script is intended to configure the packaging and distribution of the 'mypy-boto3-schemas' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing 'setup' from setuptools, and defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands; all data sources are static or file-based.",
  "flows": "The code reads the README.md file to set the long description, then passes static parameters and metadata to the 'setup()' function. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, dynamic code execution, or hardcoded secrets observed. The code is a standard package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a markdown file for description, and calls 'setup()' with static, well-formed parameters. No dynamic or user input is processed. The dependencies are specified with conditional environment markers. All operations are typical for a Python package setup script. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies.",
