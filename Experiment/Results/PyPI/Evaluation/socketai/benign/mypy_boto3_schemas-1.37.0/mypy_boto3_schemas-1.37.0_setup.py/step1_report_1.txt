  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging the mypy-boto3-schemas Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading the script itself, including the import statements, Path usage for reading README.md, and setup() arguments.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function parameters that could potentially execute or process external data or files, such as long_description content, package data, dependencies, and URLs.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setting package data and metadata -> configuring dependencies and URLs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard Python packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It reads the README.md file for long description, defines package metadata, dependencies, URLs, and package data. There are no dynamic code executions, no external data injections, or obfuscated sections. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are observed. The script's purpose is purely to configure package distribution with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior detected. It contains no suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. It is safe and serves its intended purpose.",
