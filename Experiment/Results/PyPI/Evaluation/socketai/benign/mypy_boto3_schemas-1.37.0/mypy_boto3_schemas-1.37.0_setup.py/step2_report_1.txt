  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code presence and behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools.\n   - The script reads a local README.md file for the long description.\n   - It defines package metadata, dependencies, URLs, and package data statically.\n   - No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or user input handling is observed.\n   - No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n2. **Malware and obfuscation scores**:\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the observed straightforward, static nature of the script.\n   - No indication of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation techniques.\n\n3. **Security risk assessment**:\n   - No external data flows, network activity, or untrusted data processing.\n   - No signs of supply chain compromise or malicious behavior.\n   - The script is purely for package configuration, with no evident security vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Scores consistency and justification**:\n   - The reports uniformly assign high confidence (1), zero malware, zero obfuscation, and zero security risk.\n   - These are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary and final assessment**:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation techniques used)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional notes**:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the evaluations are accurate.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThis setup script is a typical, benign package configuration file with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The assessments are correct and justified based on the code content and analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation**:\n- Maintain the scores as-is: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
