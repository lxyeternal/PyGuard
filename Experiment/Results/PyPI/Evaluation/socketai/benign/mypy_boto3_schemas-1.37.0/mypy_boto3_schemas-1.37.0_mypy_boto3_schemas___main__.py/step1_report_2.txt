  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides informational outputs about the boto3 Schemas package.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout.write for output display",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs, reading from sys.argv",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments (sys.argv) influences whether print_version or print_info is called; outputs are written to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward command-line handling and printing",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic CLI functions: displaying package info or version based on command-line input. It uses standard libraries without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or access to sensitive data. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is simple, well-structured, and typical for CLI tools. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or anomalous patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI script that outputs package information and version. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
