  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) triggers output functions (print_info or print_version)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports only the standard sys module, defines functions to print static information, and checks for '--version' argument to decide output. It performs no network activity, data collection, dynamic code execution, or use of secrets. The logic is simple and static, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. All indicators point to benign behavior, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs. The code's purpose is purely informational, and the control flow is straightforward. No anomalies or risky behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring aligns with this assessment.",
