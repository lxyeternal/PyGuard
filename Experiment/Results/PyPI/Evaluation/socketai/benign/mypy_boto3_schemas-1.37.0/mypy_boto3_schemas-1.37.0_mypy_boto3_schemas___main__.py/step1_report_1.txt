  "purpose": "CLI entrypoint script that provides package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs info to stdout)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs data), sys.argv (reads command-line input)",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (from sys.argv) to decide whether to call print_version or print_info, then output to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected; simple info display functions",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and executes based on command-line arguments. No external network connections, no data collection, or suspicious logic present. The code solely outputs static information and reacts to command-line flags, with no hidden behaviors or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs package info or version. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and solely intended for informational purposes.",
