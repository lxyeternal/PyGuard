  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**1. Code Presence & Behavior Confirmation:**\n- The code provided is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line argument (“--version”).\n- All reports correctly identify that the script only reads sys.argv and writes to sys.stdout, with no network activity, no data collection, no code execution, and no obfuscation.\n- The code is straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n\n**2. Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n- The reports uniformly state the code is benign, with no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning mistakes are evident in the reports; they are consistent and accurate.\n\n**3. Score Evaluations:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1 (or 1.0)\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n- The overall risk scores are also correctly low, reflecting no security concerns.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- Since all reports assign a risk of 0, and the code is purely informational with no malicious behavior, there's no justification for higher risk scores.\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0, indicating no malicious intent.\n\n**5. Malware and Obfuscation:**\n- No malware or obfuscation is present or claimed.\n- The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on code analysis.\n- No unwarranted claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n- No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple, static CLI script that outputs package info or version details. It does not perform any network activity, data collection, code execution, or obfuscation. The analysis and scores across all reports are accurate and justified.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no security risks or malicious behavior detected. The reports are consistent and correct in their assessments.",
