  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Behavior:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It imports only the standard library (`sys`), with no network activity, data collection, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The functions `print_info()` and `print_version()` output fixed strings.\n   - The main function checks for `--version` argument and responds accordingly.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors.\n   - No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.\n   - The code is straightforward, well-structured, and typical for CLI utilities.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the script is purely informational and does not perform any risky operations.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent with the code.\n\n5. **Score Justification & Recommendations:**\n   - The assigned scores (obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable and justified.\n   - No adjustments needed based on the current code and reports.\n\n6. **Overall Risk Assessment:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 (benign, no malicious code)\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear code)\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static information based on command-line input.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports provided.",
