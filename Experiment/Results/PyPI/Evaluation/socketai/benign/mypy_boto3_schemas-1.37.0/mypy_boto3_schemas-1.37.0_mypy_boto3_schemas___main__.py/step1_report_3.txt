  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for displaying package information or version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input parameters, sys.stdout for output display.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "User input via command-line arguments influences output, flows from sys.argv to functions that write to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected; code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The script reads command-line arguments using sys.argv to determine whether to display version or package info. It writes outputs directly to stdout. There are no external data fetches, no network operations, no code execution based on untrusted input, and no malicious patterns observed. The functions are simple and serve informational purposes only. The overall code is minimal, standard, and lacks any behavior indicative of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility for displaying package information and version details with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
