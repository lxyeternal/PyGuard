  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of a comment and a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, no data processing, and no obfuscated or suspicious code.\n- The presence of a future copyright date (2025) is unusual but not malicious.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Claims:** No sinks, no data flow, minimal anomalies, straightforward.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. The code is benign and standard.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Claims:** No untrusted data handling, no dynamic behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The code is a simple version string assignment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Claims:** No functions, no data inputs/outputs, straightforward.\n- **Verdict:** Valid. No malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Claims:** Standard version declaration, no external effects.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The code is benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Claims:** Same as above, with note on future copyright date.\n- **Analysis:** The future date is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is accurate; no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Regarding scores:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **SecurityRisk:** All assign 0, which is justified.\n\n### Potential adjustments:\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), which is appropriate.\n- No changes needed in scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports — correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0 across all reports — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year (2025), which might warrant a comment, but it does not impact security.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified here.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward version declaration with no security concerns.\n- All reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the existing reports and analysis.",
