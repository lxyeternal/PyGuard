  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__` with a copyright comment.\n- No dynamic code, input/output, network activity, or data handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- The only anomaly noted is the future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static string to `__version__`. No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n- **Malicious behavior or malware:**  \n  No malware or malicious intent is evident. The code is purely metadata.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  None detected; the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Security risks:**  \n  None apparent, given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-4:**  \n- These are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Notes the future copyright year (2025).  \n- While unusual, this is not a security concern or malware indicator. It might suggest a typo or placeholder, but it does not introduce any security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All assign 0 or very close to it, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**However,** the only notable point is the future date (2025). While it doesn't pose a security risk, it could be considered an anomaly. But since it's not malicious or suspicious, it doesn't warrant a higher risk score.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Adjustments to scores:**  \n  The current scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n- **Additional considerations:**  \n  The future date could be flagged as a minor anomaly, but it doesn't impact security or malware assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no security issues.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present.\n- The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\nThese reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the simplicity and clarity, there's no indication of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only minor anomaly (future date) does not impact security assessments. The current scoring is appropriate.",
