  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string as a module attribute with a comment indicating 'Source of truth for version' and a copyright statement. It does not perform any data processing, I/O, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated logic are present.",
