  "purpose": "Define the version of the package as a static string assigned to __version__.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string '1.37.0' to __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static assignment with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The future copyright year 2025 is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static declaration of a version string with a comment. It contains no dynamic behavior, input/output, network activity, or obfuscation. The only notable point is the future copyright year, which is an anomaly but not a security concern. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The only anomaly is the future copyright date, which does not impact security. The existing assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
