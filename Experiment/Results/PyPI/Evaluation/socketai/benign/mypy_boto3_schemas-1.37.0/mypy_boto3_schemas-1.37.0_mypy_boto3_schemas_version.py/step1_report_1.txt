  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only metadata with copyright and version information. No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a version string and a copyright comment. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, or data handling beyond static variable assignment. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python packages. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. It serves as a metadata marker for the package.",
