{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface for the schemas service, providing access to client classes, paginators, and waiters for AWS schemas via boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter), and the docstring providing example usage.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly defines imports and constants.",
  "flows": "The code initializes a client class and exposes it via a variable, with no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, no network or system calls. The docstring includes a copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future, but that appears to be a typo or placeholder, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module for importing and exposing classes and functions related to AWS schemas via boto3. It includes a docstring with example usage and documentation link, but no code execution, user input handling, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The only notable anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security but suggests a possible placeholder or typo.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module interface for AWS schemas with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is a typical Python package structure for exposing SDK components.",
