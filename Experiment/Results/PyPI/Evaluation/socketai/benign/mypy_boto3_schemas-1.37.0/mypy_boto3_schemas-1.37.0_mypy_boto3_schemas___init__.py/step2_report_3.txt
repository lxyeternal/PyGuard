  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes and functions, sets up an alias, and exports them via `__all__`.\n- They note the absence of dynamic code execution, untrusted data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- The only anomaly noted is the copyright year set to 2025, which is in the future and likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n\n**Security implications:**\n- None of the reports identify any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.\n- The code is purely structural, serving as an interface layer for AWS SDK components.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The security risk score is 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n**Potential issues or points of concern:**\n- The future copyright year (2025) is unusual but not security-related. It could be a typo or placeholder, but it does not impact security.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- I agree with the provided scores and conclusions.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final notes:**\n- This code is a standard, boilerplate module for exposing AWS SDK components.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements are present.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\nThe code is safe, benign, and typical for its purpose.",
