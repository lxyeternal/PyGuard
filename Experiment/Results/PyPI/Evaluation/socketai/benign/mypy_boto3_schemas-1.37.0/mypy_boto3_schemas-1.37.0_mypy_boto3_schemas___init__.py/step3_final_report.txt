{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for AWS schemas service by importing and exporting relevant classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter); static documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static imports and definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year '2025' noted; otherwise no anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes from local modules, assigns an alias, and defines __all__ for exports. It contains static documentation with usage examples. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or data processing is present. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a placeholder. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, structural nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign interface module with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
