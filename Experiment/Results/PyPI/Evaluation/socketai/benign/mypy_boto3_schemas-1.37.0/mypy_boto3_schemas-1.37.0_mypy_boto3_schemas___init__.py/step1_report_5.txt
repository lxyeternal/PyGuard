{
  "purpose": "This module provides an interface for interacting with AWS Schemas service, including importing client classes, paginators, and waiters for schema management operations.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from imported modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter), which are internal and do not handle untrusted input directly.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process or pass untrusted data; it mainly exports classes and functions for external use.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; the code only defines and re-exports classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package interface.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports and re-exports classes related to AWS Schemas service, providing a clean interface for other modules. It contains no input handling, no data processing, and no network or system interactions. It appears to be a typical package structure without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package interface module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely organizes and exposes classes for external use, with no evidence of backdoors, data leakage, or malicious behaviors.",
