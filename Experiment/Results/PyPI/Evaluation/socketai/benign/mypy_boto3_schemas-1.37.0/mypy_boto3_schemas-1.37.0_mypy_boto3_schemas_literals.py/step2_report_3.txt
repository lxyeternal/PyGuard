  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines a series of string literal types using Python's `Literal` for various AWS service names, resource identifiers, statuses, regions, paginator names, and waiters.\n   - It conditionally imports `Literal` from `typing` or `typing_extensions` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n   - The data is entirely static, consisting of predefined string literals assigned to type aliases.\n   - There are no input/output operations, dynamic code execution, network calls, or any form of data processing.\n   - The purpose is solely to provide type hints for static analysis and better developer tooling.\n\n2. **Security and Malware Considerations:**\n   - No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.\n   - No dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n   - The code is purely declarative, serving as a static type annotation utility.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and solely for type safety.\n   - They correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The detailed enumeration of literals and conditional imports are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, consistent with the straightforward, static nature of the code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is justified since there's no security risk.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns?**\n   - No. The reports are consistent, accurate, and well-justified.\n   - The code matches the description: static, type annotations, no malicious elements.\n\n6. **Final Expert Judgment:**\n   - The code is a standard, safe, static type declaration module for AWS SDKs.\n   - The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are appropriate.\n   - No modifications or escalations are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is benign and serves a purely supportive role in type checking.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- No security concerns.\n- Maintain current scoring.\n- Consider this code safe for production use.",
