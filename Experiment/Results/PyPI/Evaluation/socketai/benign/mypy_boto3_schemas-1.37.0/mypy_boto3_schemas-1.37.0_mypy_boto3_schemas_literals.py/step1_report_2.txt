{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations using Python's Literal for various schema-related constants and identifiers, intended for use with boto3-stubs for AWS SDK.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from predefined string literals used as type annotations for various AWS resource and service names, waiters, regions, and paginator names.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code. The code primarily declares constants for type annotations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code merely assigns string literals to type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code's structure is straightforward, using conditional imports for compatibility and defining literals.",
  "analysis": "The code's main function is to provide type-safe string literals for AWS resource identifiers, regions, waiters, and pagination names. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice. The literals are statically defined and do not include any dynamic execution, external data, or potentially malicious constructs. The large list of resource names and regions appears to be a comprehensive enumeration intended for type safety and code clarity. No signs of obfuscation, code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are observed. Overall, the code appears to serve as a safe, static type declaration module for boto3 stubs.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS resource identifiers, regions, and related constants. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. Its purpose is to enhance type safety and developer tooling support without any security concern.",
