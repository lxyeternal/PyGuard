  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS service identifiers, paginator names, region names, and other related constants for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Import of 'sys' to check Python version; definitions of constants using 'Literal' from typing or typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data processing, external input, or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code sets up type aliases and constants without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden behaviors, or unusual constructs. Use of conditional import based on Python version is standard. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type alias declarations using 'Literal' to specify allowed string values for various AWS-related identifiers. The conditional import ensures compatibility across Python versions. There are no external data inputs, outputs, or network operations. The code is purely declarative with no dynamic execution or obfuscation. No anomalies, malicious patterns, or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign, straightforward set of type annotations and constants designed for type safety. It contains no malware, security risks, or malicious intent.",
