{
  "purpose": "Defines type literals for schemas service and various AWS resource identifiers for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Import statement for sys module; conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data processing or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code consists solely of type annotations and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes string literal types for various AWS services, resources, and identifiers, using conditional imports for compatibility. There are no data inputs, network communications, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and standard for type hinting in Python, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, serving as a type definitions module for AWS SDKs. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, merely defining string literal types for validation purposes.",
