  "purpose": "Define static string literal types for AWS service names, statuses, regions, paginator names, and waiters to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals assigned to type aliases within the module.",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains no data input, output, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; the code is purely static and declarative, with no data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of static type annotations for AWS resource identifiers, regions, statuses, and other constants. It uses conditional imports for compatibility. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data processing, or network calls. All data is hardcoded and static. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behaviors are present. The purpose is solely to provide type hints for static analysis, with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended for type safety support. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
