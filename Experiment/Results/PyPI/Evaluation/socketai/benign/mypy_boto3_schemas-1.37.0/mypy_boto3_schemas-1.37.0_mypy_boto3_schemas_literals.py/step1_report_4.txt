  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various schema-related constants used in a boto3-based schemas service.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'sys' and 'typing', and the definition of constants via Literal types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only defines type annotations and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only static type definitions and imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. The license and comments are informational and do not impact security.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type annotations for literals used throughout a schemas service module. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version. The large list of service names, resource names, and other literals are static constants. There is no code execution, input handling, or data processing that could be exploited or malicious. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The license comment and documentation link are harmless and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type definitions module with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It serves as a static reference for string literals used elsewhere in the project. The risk of malware or security threat is extremely low.",
