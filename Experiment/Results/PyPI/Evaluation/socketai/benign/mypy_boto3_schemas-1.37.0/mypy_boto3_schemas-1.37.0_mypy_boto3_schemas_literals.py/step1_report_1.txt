  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS service schemas, statuses, and identifiers for use in type annotations.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, imports, and conditional import based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or data sinks are present; all data is statically defined.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only sets up type literals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; code contains straightforward type alias definitions with no dynamic or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules conditionally based on Python version, then defines multiple string Literal types representing AWS service names, status types, paginator names, region names, etc. All data is static, hardcoded string literals, with no input processing, network communication, or runtime execution of dynamic code. No backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious logic detected. The purpose is solely to provide type hints for better code clarity and static type checking. The inclusion of a lengthy list of literals does not indicate malicious intent but merely comprehensive type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward collection of type definitions for AWS schema literals, with no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security risks. It appears to be a benign utility module intended for type hinting support.",
