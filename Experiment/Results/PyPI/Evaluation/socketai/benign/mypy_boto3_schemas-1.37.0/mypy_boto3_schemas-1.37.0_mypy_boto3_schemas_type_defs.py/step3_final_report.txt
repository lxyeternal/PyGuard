  "purpose": "Type annotations for schemas service type definitions, providing static type hints and API schemas for AWS SDK in Python.",
  "sources": "Import statements, conditional imports based on Python version, and class/type definitions for request/response structures.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data handling, external data input, or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "Static data structure definitions; no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Schemas service. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, with no runtime logic, external data handling, or code execution. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The code is purely declarative, serving as type hints and documentation. The absence of runtime logic or external data processing indicates no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of static type definitions for AWS SDK in Python. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The assessments in all reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
