{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for schemas service operations and data structures used in boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, botocore.response, literals, and various type definitions; type annotations within class and variable declarations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flow points include reading environment info (sys.version_info), and handling of data inputs (function parameters, TypedDict fields). No external untrusted data sources or sinks are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and class fields (e.g., resource ARNs, schema names, tags) through type annotations; no direct untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected. Usage of standard type annotations and straightforward data structures. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code logic identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type definitions for request and response structures in a boto3 client stub, with conditional imports based on Python version, and no runtime logic. It utilizes TypedDict for structured data, aligning with AWS API specifications. No code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident. The presence of licensing, documentation, and type annotations appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a set of type annotations and data structure definitions for the AWS schemas service in boto3. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is purely structural and intended for type checking. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
