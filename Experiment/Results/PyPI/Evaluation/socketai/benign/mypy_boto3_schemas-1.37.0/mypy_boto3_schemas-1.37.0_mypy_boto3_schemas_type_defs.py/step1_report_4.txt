  "purpose": "Type definitions and schema structures for AWS Schemas service SDK, primarily for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Reads from __future__ imports, sys.version_info for environment detection, standard library imports, and local literals.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling; code is mainly static type definitions with no runtime data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; no executable logic or data manipulation present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of conditional imports based on Python version is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for various request and response structures used in AWS SDK for Python. It dynamically imports typing modules based on Python version compatibility, which is typical for cross-version support. No runtime logic, data processing, or network communication occurs within this file. It contains only static definitions of data schemas with no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. All elements serve documentation or static type checking purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of type definitions and schema representations for the AWS Schemas SDK, with no runtime or executable logic. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and purely for type hinting and documentation.",
