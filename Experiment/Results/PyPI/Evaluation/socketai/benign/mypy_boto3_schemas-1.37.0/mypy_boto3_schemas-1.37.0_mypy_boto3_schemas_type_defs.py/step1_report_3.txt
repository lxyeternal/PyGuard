{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for schemas service API requests and responses, used for type checking and validation in a larger SDK or application.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions, imported modules, and class/typedict definitions; no input reading or data parsing from external sources within this code.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted data; the code only defines data structures.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines data types and class structures without runtime logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors detected. Use of standard Python features and type annotations. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely type definitions using Python's typing and TypedDict features, intended for static type checking. No input/output handling, no runtime logic, and no external code execution. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The import statements and code structure are consistent with standard SDK or type definition files. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns that suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of type definitions for a Python SDK related to AWS schemas. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign, structured, and well-organized schema for data validation and API interaction.",
