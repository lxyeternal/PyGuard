{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for schemas service data structures used in boto3 SDK, providing type hints for request and response objects.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments, imports, and type annotations for function parameters and return types.",
  "sinks": "No execution sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or external data processing are present; primarily static type definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely defines types and data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed entirely of type alias and TypedDict class definitions, which are used for static type checking in Python. It imports necessary modules and conditionally adapts to different Python versions. No runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling occurs. The code does not contain any code execution, network activity, or potentially malicious behavior. It appears to be a straightforward set of type annotations and data structure definitions for use in boto3 clients.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, standard set of type definitions for boto3's schemas service. It does not include any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The code strictly provides static type hints without any runtime behavior.",
