  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS Schemas service API requests and responses using TypedDict for type safety and clarity.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions for API request/response structures; imports from sys, datetime, and third-party typing extensions.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no code executes or handles untrusted data directly within this module.",
  "flows": "This module provides static type definitions; it does not process runtime data or handle inputs/outputs dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward type annotation definitions with no runtime logic.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly contains type definitions for AWS schemas service API requests and responses, using TypedDict. It imports standard and third-party modules for compatibility across Python versions, with no dynamic execution, no data handling, and no external inputs or outputs. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration, are present. The content is purely declarative, serving as type hints for static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, purely declarative set of type annotations for AWS Schemas service, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any runtime operations, data handling, or network activities.",
