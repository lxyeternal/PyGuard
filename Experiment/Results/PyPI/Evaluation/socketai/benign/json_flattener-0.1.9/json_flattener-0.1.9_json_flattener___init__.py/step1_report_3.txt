  "sources": "Import statement sourcing functions and classes from a local module named 'flattener'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in the provided code snippet; this is a simple import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable from the import statement alone; it only references external code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are evident in this import statement.",
  "analysis": "This code is a straightforward import statement importing various functions and classes from a local module. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or other potentially malicious actions. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. The import appears standard for modular Python code organization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security issues based solely on this snippet.",
