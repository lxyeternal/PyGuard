{
  "purpose": "Import functions and classes related to data flattening, unflattening, configuration, and serialization from a local module.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "None; the import loads symbols into the namespace but does not execute data flow or logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; straightforward import.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard import statement from a local module 'flattener'. It involves no code execution, data handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or malicious behavior are present. The confidence in benignity is high, and no further investigation is warranted based solely on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
