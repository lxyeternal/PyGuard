{
  "purpose": "Import functions and classes related to data flattening and unflattening operations, along with configuration and serialization utilities.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module named 'flattener', which is part of the same package.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sinks are apparent from this import statement.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions and classes but does not execute any logic or data flow at this point.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement is straightforward; no unusual language features or obfuscated code are present. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports functions and classes from a local module 'flattener'. There is no executable logic, no data input handling, and no external network communication. The imported functions suggest data transformation operations, but without their implementations, no malicious behavior can be inferred. The import itself is standard practice and shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple import statement from a local module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard code pattern for modular Python projects.",
