{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data without executing dynamic code or handling untrusted input.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, including package data 'config.yml', and defining dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or runtime data processing.",
  "flows": "Static configuration data flow; no external data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Only commented-out lines; no suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical, static setup configuration with no dynamic execution, no untrusted input handling, and no network activity. Reading external files without error handling is common but not malicious. No obfuscation or secrets are present. External files like 'README.md' and 'config.yml' could be tampered with, but this is outside the scope of the script itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated content. The minimal risk associated with external file reading is acknowledged but not indicative of security issues.",
