  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for the 'json_flattener' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, package data, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description, loading package data 'config.yml', and defining setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; the code primarily sets up package metadata and configuration.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from source to sink observed. No runtime data processing or external data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Commented-out code does not affect execution.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup using setuptools, reading a README file, defining dependencies, and configuring package data. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks are present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures package metadata and data.",
