{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for packaging a Python library called 'json_flattener', including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Data is read from 'README.md' (long_description) and package data files such as 'config.yml'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly handle untrusted input or data sinks; it primarily configures package setup.",
  "flows": "No input flows from untrusted sources lead to any data leak or execution flow; setup parameters are static or file-based.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains commented-out lines, but nothing unusual or suspicious is present. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools, defines package metadata, reads a README file for long description, and specifies dependencies. It avoids executing or processing untrusted data dynamically. No indicators of malicious code, backdoors, or security issues are present. The presence of commented-out code does not impact security. The configuration is typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
