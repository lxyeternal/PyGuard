{
  "purpose": "A CLI tool for data format conversion, flattening, and unflattening of structured data files such as YAML, JSON, CSV, and TSV.",
  "sources": "File input streams via open() calls, reading YAML or JSON data, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "File output streams via open() calls, writing transformed data in CSV/TSV or YAML/JSON formats.",
  "flows": "Data read from input files → parsed into Python objects → processed (flattened/unflattened, serialized/deserialized) → written to output files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries for file I/O and data serialization. It provides CLI options for flexible data transformation, with configuration options for key serialization, flattening, and data format detection. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The functions operate solely on local files and in-memory data structures, with no network or system modification activities. The code's logic is straightforward, and the security implications are minimal, primarily related to handling untrusted input files, which is typical for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe data transformation CLI utility with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate. The security risk score is minimal (~0.2), reflecting standard processing risks without malicious activity.",
