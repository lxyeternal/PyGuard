{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for flattening and unflattening data files (JSON, YAML, CSV, TSV), with configurable options for data serialization and structure transformations.",
  "sources": "Input files specified by --input, reading YAML/JSON/CSV/TSV files; configuration files via --load-config",
  "sinks": "Output files specified by --output, writing flattened or unflattened data; saving configuration files via --save-config",
  "flows": "Input files are read and parsed into data structures, processed with optional configurations, then written to output files; configuration files are loaded or saved as YAML",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and third-party modules (yaml, json, click) to process data files with configurable transformations. It safely loads configuration files and handles different data formats. No evident malicious payloads, external network calls, or backdoors are present. The only potential concern is file handling, which appears straightforward and controlled. There are no signs of code obfuscation or malicious behavior; all operations are typical data processing routines.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI tool for data transformation with no detected malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for data format conversions.",
