{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Streamlit web application that integrates a custom camera input component for capturing images via a web interface and displaying them.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters, the base64-encoded image data from the custom component, and file paths for the frontend directory.",
  "sinks": "The code decodes base64 image data and displays it using Streamlit's image function.",
  "flows": "Input from the user (via the camera component) → base64 data is extracted and decoded → image is rendered in the app.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The use of external components is declared, with no evidence of malicious intent. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for handling base64 data, file paths, and Streamlit for web UI. It declares a custom frontend component 'camera_input_live' which likely involves external frontend code in the 'frontend' folder. The function 'camera_input_live' calls this component and processes its base64 string output to generate an image stream. The main function displays the image if available. There are no signs of malicious data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or unsafe operations. The code simply processes image data for display, with no network calls aside from the component declaration, which is expected and standard for custom Streamlit components.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a camera input feature in a Streamlit app. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The only external element is the custom frontend component, which is typical for such integrations. Overall, the code is safe and does not exhibit any suspicious activities.",
