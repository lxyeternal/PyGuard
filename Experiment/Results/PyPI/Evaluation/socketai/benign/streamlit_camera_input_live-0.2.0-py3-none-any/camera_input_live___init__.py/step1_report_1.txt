{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Streamlit component for capturing images via a live camera feed and displaying the captured image.",
  "sources": "Reads base64-encoded image data from a custom frontend component (_component_func) upon user interaction.",
  "sinks": "Decodes base64 data and displays the image using Streamlit's st.image function.",
  "flows": "User interacts with frontend component -> base64 data sent to backend -> split and decode base64 -> BytesIO object created -> displayed as image.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or obfuscated code detected. No external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily acts as an interface between a custom frontend component and Streamlit. It processes image data transmitted as base64 strings. There are no evident malicious functions such as network communications, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The data handling appears straightforward and intended for capturing and displaying images. No suspicious patterns or security flaws like insecure data handling or code injection are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for capturing images in a Streamlit app, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply processes image data from a user-controlled component for display.",
