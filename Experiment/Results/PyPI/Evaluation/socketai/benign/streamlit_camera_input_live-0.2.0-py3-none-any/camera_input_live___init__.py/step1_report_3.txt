{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Streamlit-based frontend component for capturing images from a camera via a custom web component, and then displays the captured image.",
  "sources": "Input is received from the custom frontend component 'camera_input_live' which supplies base64-encoded image data as a string.",
  "sinks": "The image data is decoded from base64 and stored in a BytesIO object, then used by 'st.image()' to display the image.",
  "flows": "The custom component provides base64 image data -> the code splits and decodes the base64 string -> converts to BytesIO -> displayed via Streamlit's 'st.image()'.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. No suspicious data exfiltration, code injection, or external connections are present.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles image data from a frontend component by decoding base64 and displaying it. No user input is used in a risky manner; no network connections or sensitive data handling beyond image display is involved. The component relies on an external frontend for input, which is standard for Streamlit custom components. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities in the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for capturing and displaying camera images in a Streamlit app. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
