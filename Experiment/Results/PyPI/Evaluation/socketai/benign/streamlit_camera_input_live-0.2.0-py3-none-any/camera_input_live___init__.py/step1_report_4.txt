{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Streamlit application that integrates a custom camera input component to capture images and display them within the app.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the custom component 'camera_input_live' which provides base64-encoded image data.",
  "sinks": "The base64 data is decoded into a BytesIO object and used as an image for display via 'st.image'. No other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves receiving base64-encoded image data from the component, decoding it, and then rendering it as an image in the app.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are observed. The code primarily handles data encoding/decoding and component declaration. The use of a custom frontend component is standard for Streamlit extensions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Streamlit application that integrates a custom frontend component for live camera input. It processes base64-encoded images sent from the frontend, decodes them, and displays the image. There are no signs of malicious data handling, data leakage, or malicious code execution. The component's internal implementation is external (in the 'frontend' directory) and not accessible here, but based on this code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The flow is straightforward, and no unsafe operations are present. The code's security relies on the integrity of the external component, which cannot be evaluated here. Overall, the code appears benign and standard for such an application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a Streamlit app with a custom camera input component. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious code patterns, or security risks identified within this module. The security profile is considered low risk.",
