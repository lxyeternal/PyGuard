  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'spidev' Python package, used to build and install the package and its C extension module for Linux SPI access.",
  "sources": "Reading 'spidev_module.c' to extract version info, reading 'README.md' and 'CHANGELOG.md' for long description, and input parameters in setup().",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call that installs the package; reading files for version and description; no untrusted data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "Reading 'spidev_module.c' to determine version -> setup() parameters including description and version -> installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward setup script. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a version string from a C source file, gathers description data from markdown files, and passes static metadata to setuptools for package installation. There are no network operations, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input. The code adheres to typical setup procedures and does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with a C extension. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use.",
