{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up and configure the Python package 'spidev', including reading version information from a C source file and defining package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'spidev_module.c' to extract version; reading files 'README.md' and 'CHANGELOG.md' for long description; hardcoded package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "The setup function executes during package installation, but does not execute untrusted data or network operations; no sinks indicate data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Extracts version from source file -> uses static metadata in setup -> no untrusted data flows or network communication present.",
  "anomalies": "None detected: no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior; version extraction is straightforward; no obfuscated or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a C source file to extract version info, which is standard for such setup scripts. It constructs package metadata and invokes setuptools.setup() with static information and a defined extension module. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are involved. The code appears to be standard package setup code with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package involving a C extension. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present. It is safe and appears to be a legitimate build script.",
