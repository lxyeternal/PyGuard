  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package with a C extension, reading local files for version and description.",
  "sources": "Reads 'spidev_module.c' for version info, 'README.md' and 'CHANGELOG.md' for descriptions.",
  "sinks": "Passes data to setuptools' setup() function; no untrusted data sinks or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Reads local files, extracts version, and passes static data to setup(), with no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks, reading local files for metadata, with no network activity, dynamic code execution, or user input. It is straightforward and adheres to standard practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The reliance on local files is common in build scripts, and the code structure is transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. No modifications are necessary; the code is safe for use.",
