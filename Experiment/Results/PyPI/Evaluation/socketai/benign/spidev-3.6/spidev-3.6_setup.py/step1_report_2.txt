  "purpose": "This script sets up and installs a Python package named 'spidev' with C extension modules, intended for Linux SPI hardware access.",
  "sources": "Reads 'spidev_module.c' to extract version info; reads 'README.md' and 'CHANGELOG.md' for long description; static strings for author, maintainer, and URL; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "Passes data to setuptools' setup() function for package creation; no data sinks related to untrusted data or security-critical operations.",
  "flows": "Extracts version from 'spidev_module.c' and feeds it into setup() along with static package metadata; no dynamic data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard setup tasks with straightforward file reading and package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a C source file to obtain version info, then uses setuptools to configure package metadata and extension modules. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. All data sources are static or local files, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a hardware access Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs typical package configuration tasks without suspicious activity.",
