{
  "purpose": "This module provides functionality for reading and processing pcap files, specifically supporting offline capture files, mimicking the interface of pcapy for offline analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from specified files or standard input (stdin) when opening offline pcap files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are explicitly present in this code; the main output is file creation/writing in the Dumper class, which writes packet data to a file.",
  "flows": "Data is read from the input file in the Reader class, processed into packet headers and data, and optionally written to output files via Dumper. There are no flows involving untrusted input affecting system state or external services.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code appears standard for a pcap file parser. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variables are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a pcap file parser with standard features: reading global headers, packet headers, and packet data. It includes functions for byte order correction, file opening, and error handling. No network operations, external data transmission, or suspicious behaviors are present. The open_live, lookupdev, findalldevs, compile, getnet, getmask, and setnonblock functions raise NotImplementedError, indicating limited scope to offline file processing. The code adheres to standard file I/O and struct unpacking, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a pcap file reader and writer, intended for offline packet analysis. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. No suspicious or malicious code is found. The overall security risk is low.",
