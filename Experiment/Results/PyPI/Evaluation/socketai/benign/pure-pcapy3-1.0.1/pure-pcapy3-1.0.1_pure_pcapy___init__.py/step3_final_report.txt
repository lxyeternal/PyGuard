{
  "purpose": "A Python module for reading and writing pcap files, supporting offline file processing with no live capture capabilities.",
  "sources": "File input streams, specifically reading from pcap files or stdin",
  "sinks": "File output streams when writing pcap files via Dumper",
  "flows": "Data flows from file source through parsing functions, with no external network or system command interactions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with proper error handling and no suspicious behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard pcap file parser and writer in Python, handling endianness, parsing headers, and reading packet data. It does not perform network operations, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. Functions related to live capture are unimplemented, indicating limited scope. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. Error handling is appropriate, and the code structure is clear and readable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for offline pcap file processing with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0.1 are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
