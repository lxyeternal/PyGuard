{
  "purpose": "This module provides a pure Python interface for reading and writing PCAP files, mimicking the pcapy library for offline packet analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from specified pcap files via open_offline(), and reads packet data within the Reader.next() method.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks for untrusted data or external communication; the code writes pcap data via the Dumper.dump() method, which writes to local files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the file source into packet headers and data within the Reader.next() method, with no external network interactions or data leaks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments detected. All code appears consistent with standard pcap file processing. Exception handling is standard; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard pcap file parser and writer with appropriate data handling, header unpacking, and byte order correction. The functions open_offline(), Reader, and Dumper perform file I/O operations without suspicious or malicious behavior. No network activity, external data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The only potentially sensitive data involved are pcap files, which are read and written locally. No hardcoded secrets, environment variable misuse, or insecure data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a pcap file reader and writer, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network communication or data exfiltration. No anomalies or malware indicators identified.",
