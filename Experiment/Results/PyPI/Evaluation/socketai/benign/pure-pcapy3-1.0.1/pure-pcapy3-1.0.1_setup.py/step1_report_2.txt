  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'pure-pcapy3' Python package, providing metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static metadata and package setup functions; no input data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code is purely configuration without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and test configuration. There are no dynamic or insecure operations, no hardcoded credentials, and no external data inputs or outputs. The script appears to be straightforward and adheres to common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
