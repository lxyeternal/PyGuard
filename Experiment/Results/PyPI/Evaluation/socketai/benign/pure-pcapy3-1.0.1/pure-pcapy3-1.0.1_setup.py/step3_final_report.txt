  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. It does not perform any runtime data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution.",
  "sources": "Package metadata fields (name, version, author, description, url, long_description), find_packages() for package discovery",
  "sinks": "None; the script does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects",
  "flows": "N/A; the script is static and declarative, with no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected; the code is straightforward and adheres to standard packaging practices",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration script using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and test suite without executing any dynamic or malicious code. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which are justified given the code's static, declarative nature.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package configuration file with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
