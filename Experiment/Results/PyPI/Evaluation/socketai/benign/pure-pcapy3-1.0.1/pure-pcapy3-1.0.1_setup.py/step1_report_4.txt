  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'pure-pcapy3' Python package, providing metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Standard Python setup script sources: package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery via find_packages.",
  "sinks": "None. The code does not execute untrusted input or perform data leakage.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this is static configuration code without data flow or external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code follows standard setup script conventions without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools to define package setup parameters such as name, version, author info, description, license, keywords, URL, long description, required dependencies, and test suite. It uses find_packages to discover packages excluding 'test'. The code is purely declarative and does not include any dynamic execution, external input handling, or potentially malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
