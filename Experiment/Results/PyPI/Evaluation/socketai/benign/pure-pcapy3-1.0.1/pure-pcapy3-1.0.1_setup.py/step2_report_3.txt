  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python library called `pure-pcapy3`.\n- It uses `setuptools` to specify package metadata, dependencies, and test configuration.\n- There are no runtime data handling, external input, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code appears to be straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious constructs.\n- They consistently state that the code is a typical setup script, with no anomalies, obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n- The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code or malware?**  \n  No. The code is purely declarative, defining package metadata. There are no embedded scripts, code injection, or external data handling.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or security risks?**  \n  None. The script does not process untrusted data, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations.\n\n- **Any suspicious claims?**  \n  No. All reports agree on benign nature.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware score: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated score: 0 (correct)\n  - Security risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the consistent findings and the nature of the code, **there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks**. The code is a standard packaging script.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely static configuration, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The high confidence scores from reports are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate. The code is benign, standard, and safe. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
