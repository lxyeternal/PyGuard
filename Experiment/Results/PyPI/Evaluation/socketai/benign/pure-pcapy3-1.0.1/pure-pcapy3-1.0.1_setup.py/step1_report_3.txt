{
  "purpose": "This code defines setup configuration for a Python package called 'pure-pcapy3'. Its purpose is to package and distribute a Python reimplementation of pcapy.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata such as name, version, author info, description, dependencies, and URL.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or user input; the code only defines package metadata and installation parameters.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing setup tools, defining package configuration, and calling setup() with static parameters. There are no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present. All code is standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and test configuration. No code execution or untrusted data handling occurs. The code does not include any external input processing, dynamic code execution, or other behaviors that could be malicious. It simply declares static package information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is a benign configuration file used for package distribution.",
