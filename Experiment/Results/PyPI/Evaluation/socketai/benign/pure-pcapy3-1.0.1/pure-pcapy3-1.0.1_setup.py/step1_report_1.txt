  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the script follows standard setup pattern. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration for packaging a Python library. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and test configurations. No runtime code execution, input/output handling, or data processing occurs here. The absence of code injection, untrusted data handling, or external network interactions indicates no malicious behavior. The script adheres to common packaging standards and contains no unusual or suspicious code structures.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is benign and serves only for package distribution purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks present in this code.",
