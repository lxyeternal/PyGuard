  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: code presence, logical consistency, potential vulnerabilities, malicious indicators, and scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a setup configuration for 'lz4', involving environment variables, module imports, and file reads.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Describes the flow from environment variables to build configuration, which is accurate.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The environment variable checks are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment correctly states that the script is a typical build setup with low risk.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to environment variable influence, which is common.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on dependency detection and build configuration.\n- No suspicious activity or code anomalies.\n- Correctly notes the use of environment variables and standard build practices.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher but still very low; environment variables are standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- Focuses on dependency management and environment-based build configuration.\n- No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- Standard use of environment variables and dependency detection.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — consistent with typical build scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- Highlights environment-based configuration, dependency management, and extension compilation.\n- No suspicious code or malicious patterns.\n- Standard practices observed.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- Summarizes the script as a build configuration with environment variables and dependency checks.\n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Clear, straightforward logic.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — consistent with typical build scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code's purpose as a build script, this is expected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher than 0, but justified due to environment variable influence on build behavior, which is common and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation\n\n**Malware:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n\n**Risk:** **0.2** — low, standard build configuration with environment-based toggles.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- No evidence of supply chain attack vectors or malicious backdoors.\n- The code relies on environment variables, which is typical for configurable build scripts.\n- No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The package setup script is a legitimate, standard build configuration with no security concerns based on the provided code and reports.",
