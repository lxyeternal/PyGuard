  "purpose": "Setup script for building and installing the Python lz4 package, including optional compilation of extension modules and dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing modules, defining file paths for C extensions, reading README.rst, and configuring setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executing system commands via setup(), reading environment variables that influence build behavior, and importing modules that could execute code during import.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (e.g., PYLZ4_EXPERIMENTAL, PYLZ4_USE_SYSTEM_LZ4) influence conditional logic for building extensions; imported modules like setuptools and pkgconfig influence build process; setup() call initiates build and install actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious network activity; no unusual code constructs. The code mainly handles build configuration with standard library functions and third-party modules.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment-based configuration for building Python C extensions, with optional experimental features. It uses environment variables to determine whether to include certain modules or use system libraries. Imports are limited to standard and well-known third-party modules like setuptools and pkgconfig, with error handling that defaults to safe options. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is detected. The setup process appears standard for a C extension Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code flow.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with C extensions. It includes environment-based configuration, dependency management, and extension compilation. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. The code appears safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
