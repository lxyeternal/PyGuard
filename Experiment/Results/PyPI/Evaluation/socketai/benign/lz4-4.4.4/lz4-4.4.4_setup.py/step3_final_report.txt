  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration script for the 'lz4' Python package, managing dependencies, environment variables, and build extension modules.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PYLZ4_EXPERIMENTAL, PYLZ4_USE_SYSTEM_LZ4), imported modules, file reads (README.rst), dependency detection via pkgconfig.",
  "sinks": "Build configuration parameters influencing compiler flags, included libraries, and extension modules; no data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence build flags and feature inclusion; dependency detection determines system vs bundled libraries; ultimately calls setup() to build/install.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected; code follows standard practices for build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs dependency checks, manages environment variables for optional features, sets compiler flags based on platform and compiler, and configures extension modules accordingly. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The logic is straightforward, with standard error handling and dependency management. No network activity or data exfiltration is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard build setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly zero; the low risk score (~0.1-0.2) is appropriate given the environment-based configuration but does not indicate any threat.",
