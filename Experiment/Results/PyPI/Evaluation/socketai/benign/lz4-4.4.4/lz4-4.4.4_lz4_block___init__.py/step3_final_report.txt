  "purpose": "Import functions and error class from a local module '_block' for use within the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data, nor does it perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "The import loads symbols into the namespace; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present; the import is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard import statement from a local module, with a linter suppression comment. It does not process data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign nature of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
