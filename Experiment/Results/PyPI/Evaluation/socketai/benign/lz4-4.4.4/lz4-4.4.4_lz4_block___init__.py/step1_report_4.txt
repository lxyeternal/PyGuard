  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are evident in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined from this isolated import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward import with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three elements (compress, decompress, LZ4BlockError) from a relative module _block, which appears to be a local module. There are no data inputs, network operations, or suspicious code behaviors present. The import statement is standard and does not indicate malicious intent or malware. The presence of a noqa comment indicates standard linting suppression and does not add any malicious context.",
