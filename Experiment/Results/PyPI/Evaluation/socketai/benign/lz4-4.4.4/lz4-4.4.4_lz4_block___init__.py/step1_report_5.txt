{
  "purpose": "This code imports functions and an exception class related to data compression and decompression, likely for handling data streams or files.",
  "sources": "Import statement accessing internal module _block for compression functions and error class",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data output operations are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are observable within this minimal code snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import from a relative internal module named _block. It imports three identifiers: 'compress', 'decompress', and 'LZ4BlockError'. These are typical for a compression library and do not indicate malicious intent. The use of '# noqa: F401' suggests that some imported names may not be used in this module, possibly for external API or future use. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The code is simple and appears to be a normal part of a compression library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign import statement for compression functions and error handling, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
