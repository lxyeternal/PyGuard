  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement from a local module `_block`.\n   - There are no signs of code anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior in the snippet.\n   - The import is straightforward, and the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - Since the code is a benign import statement with no data flow, no external communication, and no suspicious behavior, the risk score remains at 0.\n   - Malware score is correctly 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they do not infer malicious intent where none exists.\n   - They correctly interpret the import as part of a larger compression library, not suspicious in itself.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code snippet is benign and does not pose any security threat.** It is a standard import statement typical of internal modules in a package.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately score the snippet as safe. No changes are needed.",
