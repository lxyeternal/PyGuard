  "purpose": "Import functions and error class related to block compression and decompression, likely part of a larger compression library.",
  "sources": "The import statement sourcing from a relative module '_block' within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs an import, no data flow occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; this is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three items from a local module '_block': 'compress', 'decompress', and 'LZ4BlockError'. There is no use of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The import appears standard for a package that handles compression operations. No external inputs or outputs are present in this snippet. Given the simplicity, it does not contain obfuscation, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic import from a local module with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is a standard part of a package's internal structure.",
