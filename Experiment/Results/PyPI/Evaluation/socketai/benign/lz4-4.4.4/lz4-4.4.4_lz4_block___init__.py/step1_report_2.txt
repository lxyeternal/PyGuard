  "purpose": "Import compression and decompression functions and an error class from a local module, likely for data processing within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module '_block'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; this is a simple import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; the code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three elements: 'compress', 'decompress', and 'LZ4BlockError' from a local module '_block'. The use of a relative import suggests internal modularization. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or external communications are present. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors in this minimal snippet. It is a typical import statement for a compression library component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement for local compression functionalities and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
