{
  "purpose": "The code imports compression and decompression functions along with an error class from a local module named _block.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module _block for importing functions and classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or output within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and only contains import statements. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and an error class from a local module. There is no data processing, user input handling, or external communication. The import statement appears standard and legitimate, assuming the _block module is part of the same package. No anomalies, malicious behavior, or security risks are detectable within this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement from a local module, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger compression library without any malicious intent.",
