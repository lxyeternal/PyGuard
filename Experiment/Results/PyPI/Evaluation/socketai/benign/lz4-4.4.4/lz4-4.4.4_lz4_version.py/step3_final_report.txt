  "purpose": "Static version information module generated by setuptools-scm, providing version strings and tuples.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string '4.4.4' and version tuple (4, 4, 4). No external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with standard type hints and no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static module defining version information with no dynamic behavior, external inputs, or network activity. The use of TYPE_CHECKING is standard for type hints and does not introduce security issues. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The version string and tuple are hardcoded, which is typical for such modules. All indicators point to benign, auto-generated code intended solely for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version info module with no malicious intent or security risks. All previous reports correctly identified its nature, and their assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
