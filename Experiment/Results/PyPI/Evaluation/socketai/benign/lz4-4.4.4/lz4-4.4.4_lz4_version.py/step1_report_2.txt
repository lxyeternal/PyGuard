{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, and sets version variables.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and version tuples.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing, input/output, or network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only assigns static version information without any data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The use of TYPE_CHECKING and conditional definitions are standard; no suspicious or unusual code constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of variable definitions and type hints for versioning, generated by setuptools-scm. There are no input sources, external data, or potential security-sensitive sinks. The use of conditional typing is standard for type hints and does not introduce security concerns. Overall, the code appears to be boilerplate version information with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version info module generated by setuptools-scm. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks are present.",
