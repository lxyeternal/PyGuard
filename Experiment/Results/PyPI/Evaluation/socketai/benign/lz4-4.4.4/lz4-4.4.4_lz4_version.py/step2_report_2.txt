  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency, correctness, and to identify any potential discrepancies or overlooked risks.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is static, auto-generated version info with no external data input, no network activity, and no dynamic behavior.\n- The use of TYPE_CHECKING and conditional type hints is standard practice.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The version string '4.4.4' and the tuple (4, 4, 4) are hardcoded and typical for version management.\n\n**Specific points per report:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - Confirms benign, straightforward code with no malicious intent.  \n   - Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — aligns well with the analysis.\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - Also describes standard boilerplate code with no external data or malicious behavior.  \n   - Scores are consistent.\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - Highlights the static assignment and standard type hinting practices.  \n   - No issues detected; scores are appropriate.\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - Same conclusions; the code is auto-generated version info with no risks.  \n   - Scores are consistent.\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - Similar to others; no malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n   - Scores match the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, static, and auto-generated. No issues are present.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  **No.** All reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  - **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.  \n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; no obfuscation detected.  \n  - **Security risk score:** 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or risks are present.\n\n- **Any claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports base their conclusions on observable code features, which are benign.\n\n- **Are the scores consistent with the report content?**  \n  Yes, they are.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the code's static, straightforward nature, the lack of any malicious or suspicious features, and the correct identification in all reports, I agree with the provided scores.\n\n**However, considering the scoring system:**\n\n- The malware score is 0, which is correct.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n- The overall security risk is 0, which is correct.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat. The scoring aligns with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a benign, static version info module with no malicious or obfuscated elements.  \n- All reports correctly identify this, and their scores are appropriate.  \n- No further action needed.",
