  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version module for a Python package.\n- It contains only static assignments of version strings and tuples.\n- The use of TYPE_CHECKING and conditional type hints is typical and harmless.\n- No external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, straightforward, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Fully accurate. No issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the static, boilerplate nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Correctly states the code is static, with no external inputs or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Notes the static assignment and the standard type-checking block, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the code as auto-generated, benign, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusions:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n- No report overstates or underestimates the risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and auto-generated.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n**Note:** Given the static, auto-generated nature of this version module, there is no reason to assign any higher scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is a standard version info module with no security concerns.",
