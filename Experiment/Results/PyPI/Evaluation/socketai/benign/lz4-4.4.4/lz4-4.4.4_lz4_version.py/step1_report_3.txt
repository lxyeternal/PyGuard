  "purpose": "Defines version information for a package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples directly in code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Direct assignment of static version data; no data flow from external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version information variables explicitly with static strings and tuples. There are no inputs, external data sources, or complex logic. The TYPE_CHECKING block is standard for type hinting and is conditionally compiled, which is typical in type hinting practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static version information definition with no malicious intent or security risks.",
