  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version info module.\n- It contains static version strings and tuples.\n- No external data input, no network or I/O operations.\n- The conditional `TYPE_CHECKING` block is standard for type hints and does not execute at runtime.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The code is straightforward and typical for package versioning.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, straightforward, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `risk=0.5` (not explicitly given, but should be low).\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly states that the code is boilerplate, with no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `risk=0`.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above, no issues.\n- **Scores:** Consistent with benign code.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above, standard version info code.\n- **Scores:** No issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign `0`. The code contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign `0`, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign `0`. Given the static, benign nature, this is appropriate. The only potential concern could be the version string, but hardcoded version info is standard and not risky.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- The code does not execute any external data, nor does it contain any obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- No reason to increase malware or risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned by all reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- No modifications needed.\n- The code is entirely benign, with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own assessment:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n| **0** | **0** | **0** |\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard version info module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action required.",
