{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm, providing version strings and tuples for package management.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version and version tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only sets static version information.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external inputs; static assignment of version variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. It includes a type-checking conditional, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily initializes version-related variables with static data and includes a type checking block that does not execute at runtime. The only potential concern is the version string, but it is a hardcoded static value, typical for package versioning. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard version info module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be auto-generated by a build tool and contains no sensitive or dangerous code.",
