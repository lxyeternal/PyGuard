  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and version tuples; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leak points present.",
  "flows": "No flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; straightforward assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns; simple version definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple) with fixed, hardcoded version data ('4.4.4' and corresponding tuple). It includes conditional typing constructs but no dynamic code execution, no data input/output, and no malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is standard for version info in Python packages and contains no malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version definition module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
