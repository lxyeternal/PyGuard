{
  "purpose": "Defines version information for the package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings assigned to __version__, version, __version_tuple__, and version_tuple.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; purely static assignment of version information.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "Contains an unnecessary TYPE_CHECKING block and type annotations, but no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version metadata for a Python package, including version strings and tuples. It includes a conditional block for type checking that does not execute at runtime and assigns static version values. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no network operations, or any suspicious logic. The code appears to be auto-generated by setuptools-scm, intended solely for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign version definition module with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to provide version info in a static manner.",
