{
  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions for incremental LZ4 frame compression and decompression, as well as file wrappers for transparent compression/decompression of files.",
  "sources": "Input data from method parameters (e.g., compress(), decompress()), file reads/writes, external libraries (_compression, lz4).",
  "sinks": "Output compressed/decompressed data, file output, data passed to external functions, or written to files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters or files into compression/decompression functions, then to output buffers or files, with context management for incremental processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. Uses standard external libraries and well-structured classes.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard LZ4 frame compression/decompression with file support, managing contexts properly, and providing incremental processing. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. External dependencies are trusted, and code clarity is high. The data flow is straightforward, with no suspicious sinks or flows. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an LZ4 compression library with file wrappers. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
