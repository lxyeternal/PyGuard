  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a standard Sphinx configuration file for the python-lz4 project.\n- They consistently note that the code only sets configuration parameters, imports standard modules, and retrieves version info in a typical, safe manner.\n- No untrusted data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are observed.\n- The code appears static and solely intended for documentation setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code presence:** The code is a straightforward configuration script, with no anomalies or malicious constructs.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: consistently 0\n  - Obfuscated: consistently 0\n  - Risk: consistently 0\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The import of `importlib.metadata` with a fallback to `pkg_resources.get_distribution` is standard for compatibility.\n- No user input, untrusted data, or external commands are executed.\n- No suspicious patterns or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code's purpose is solely configuration, with no potential for malicious side effects.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious intent or activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate; no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the detailed analysis, **the overall scores should remain at zero** for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a benign, standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation. There are no indications of supply chain or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent in identifying this code as safe and standard. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
