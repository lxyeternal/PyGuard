  "purpose": "Configuration script for building documentation for the python-lz4 project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, os, importlib.metadata or pkg_resources, sphinx_bootstrap_theme; Reads configuration variables and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; configuration variables are static, no user input handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; code primarily sets configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. Usage of importlib.metadata or pkg_resources to retrieve package version is standard practice. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation generation, containing imports, setup for themes, paths, and project metadata. It uses conventional Python modules and libraries for setting project info, theming, and output options. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or malware. No data leaks, network activities, or unsafe operations are evident. The script is static and mainly assigns configuration variables.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears solely for documentation setup purposes.",
