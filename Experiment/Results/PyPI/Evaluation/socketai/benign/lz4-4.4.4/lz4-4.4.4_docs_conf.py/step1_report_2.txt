  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building project documentation using Sphinx, including theme settings, project info, and output options.",
  "sources": "Imports 'sys', 'os', 'importlib.metadata' (or 'pkg_resources'), and 'sphinx_bootstrap_theme'; reads project metadata and configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "No potential sink points for untrusted data or malicious output identified.",
  "flows": "Imports and reads project version info; configuration variables are set directly; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns observed. Commented-out code is standard for configuration files.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx documentation configuration file, defining settings for themes, extensions, paths, and project metadata. It imports necessary modules to dynamically determine project version, which is standard practice. No data is read from untrusted sources, and no functions or code perform network or system modifications. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This file is a standard configuration script for Sphinx documentation generation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages documentation settings without executing harmful actions.",
