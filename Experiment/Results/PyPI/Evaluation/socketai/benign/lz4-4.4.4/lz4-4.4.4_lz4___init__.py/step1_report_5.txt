  "purpose": "To import the package version information from local files instead of using slow system calls.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .version and ._version",
  "sinks": "None; the code only imports data from local modules, no external untrusted data sources or outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code referencing potentially slow system package queries; no active suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages version information by importing from local modules, bypassing potentially slow system calls. No input handling, network activity, or execution of untrusted code is present. The commented-out section suggests awareness of alternative version retrieval methods but is inactive. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to set version variables from local files with no malicious intent or security risks.",
