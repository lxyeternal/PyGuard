{
  "purpose": "Define and set the package version using a local file instead of slow package resource lookup.",
  "sources": "Import from .version and ._version modules which presumably contain version information.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "The code imports version information from local modules to assign to __version__ and VERSION variables.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code for package version retrieval via pkg_resources, replaced by local imports. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code replaces a potentially slow method of retrieving package version with local imports from modules that likely contain version info. No external inputs, no data leaks, and no dynamic execution or obfuscated code. The approach appears legitimate and standard for managing package versions. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, handling version information safely via local modules. No malicious intent or security issues identified.",
