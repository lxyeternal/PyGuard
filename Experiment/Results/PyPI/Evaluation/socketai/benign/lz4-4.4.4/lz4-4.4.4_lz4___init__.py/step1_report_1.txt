{
  "purpose": "The code manages the retrieval of the package version, favoring a local file over slow system queries, and imports version-related information from internal modules.",
  "sources": "Reading from local module files (.version and ._version) for version information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or external output, only internal data access and variable assignment.",
  "flows": "Local module imports provide version data; no external or untrusted data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code for dynamic version retrieval indicates an awareness of potential performance issues, but nothing unusual or suspicious is present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code comments explain an alternative method for version retrieval to avoid performance issues with 'pkg_resources'. The active code imports version information from local modules, which is standard practice for managing package metadata. The presence of commented-out code suggests consideration for dynamic version fetching but is not active. No input handling, external data processing, or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focused solely on version management within the package. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
