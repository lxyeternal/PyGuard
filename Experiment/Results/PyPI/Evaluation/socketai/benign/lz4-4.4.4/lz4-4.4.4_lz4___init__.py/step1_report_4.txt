{
  "purpose": "The code aims to define and retrieve the package version information, either from a local file or, as commented out, via the pkg_resources method for compatibility and speed.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information from local files imported from the package's internal modules (.version and ._version). The commented section indicates a potential source from external package metadata via pkg_resources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or exposed; the code only sets version variables.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the imported local version variables to the global VERSION variable, with no external data flow or untrusted input handling present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. The code contains commented-out legacy code for obtaining version info, which is normal for compatibility considerations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages package versioning by importing version details from local files, avoiding the slower pkg_resources method. The commented-out code indicates awareness of alternative approaches. No user input, network operations, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code's structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version management snippet, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It maintains good practice by avoiding potentially slow external package queries. Overall, it appears benign and safe.",
