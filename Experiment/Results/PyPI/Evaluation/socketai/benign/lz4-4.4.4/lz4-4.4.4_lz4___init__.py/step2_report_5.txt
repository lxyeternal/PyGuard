  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the claims, scoring, and overall security implications.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core code: importing version info from local modules (.version and ._version), with commented-out code for dynamic retrieval via pkg_resources.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or user input is involved.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.\n- The commented-out code indicates awareness of alternative approaches but is inactive.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: it imports version info from local modules, avoiding the slow pkg_resources method.\n- No active malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The code appears to be standard package version management.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The commented-out code could be cleaned up or documented for clarity, but this does not impact security.\n- The approach is acceptable, balancing performance and correctness.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is detected or suggested.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- No reason exists to increase any scores; the code is benign and standard.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable in their scoring.\n- The confidence level is 1, which is justified given the clear and standard code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no malicious intent.\n- The commented-out code does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n- Importing version info from local modules is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The code is benign, secure, and well-understood. No further action or concern is necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.",
