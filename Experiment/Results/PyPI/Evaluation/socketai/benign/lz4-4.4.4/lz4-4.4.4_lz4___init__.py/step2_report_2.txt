  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code's purpose is to manage package version information, favoring local module imports over the slower `pkg_resources` method.\n- The commented-out code indicates awareness of alternative approaches but is inactive.\n- No external data, user input, or network activity is involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The code is standard for package version management.\n\n**Malware and obfuscation scores:**\n\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.\n\n**Security risk scores:**\n\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's benign purpose.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- Given the code's straightforward nature, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Risk score justification:**\n\n- The overall risk score is 0 for all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The malware score remains 0, reflecting no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The confidence score is 1, indicating high certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports correctly assess the code as benign, with no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and no security risks. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n**Final note:** No further action or concern is warranted based on these reports.",
