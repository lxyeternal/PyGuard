{
  "purpose": "The code defines and assigns version information for a Python package, either by importing from local files or (commented out) via a slower method from installed distributions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.version' and '._version'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; version information assignment does not involve external untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Imports version info from local files; no data flow from external sources or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the commented-out code indicates awareness of alternative methods but is inactive.",
  "analysis": "The script provides version information for a package, opting for a local version file due to performance concerns with the standard 'pkg_resources' method. The code is straightforward, referencing local modules, with no dynamic code execution or data handling from external sources. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The presence of commented code shows awareness but does not introduce malicious behavior. Overall, the code is normal package version management code, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package version definition with no malicious behavior or security risks. It employs standard practices, with no active suspicious code or vulnerabilities.",
