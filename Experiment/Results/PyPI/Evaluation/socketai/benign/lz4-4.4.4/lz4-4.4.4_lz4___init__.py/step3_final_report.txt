  "purpose": "Manage package version information by importing from local modules, avoiding the slower pkg_resources method.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .version and ._version modules; commented-out code for external pkg_resources retrieval.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements with no data flow.",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version import with commented-out alternative approach.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info from local modules, with no external data, user input, or network activity. The commented code indicates awareness of alternative methods but is inactive. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code is standard for package version management, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence in benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and standard for version management. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
