  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines two classes: `LZ4StreamDecompressor` and `LZ4StreamCompressor`.\n- Both classes initialize internal contexts via `_create_context`, passing user parameters.\n- They provide methods for streaming compression/decompression, such as `decompress`, `compress`, and `get_block`.\n- The actual core processing is delegated to external functions `_decompress`, `_compress`, `_get_block`, which are imported from an internal module.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or obfuscated code are present.\n- Context management (`__enter__`, `__exit__`) is implemented but does nothing beyond standard pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n**Issue presence in code:**\n- The code appears consistent with the reports' description. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code.\n- The functions `_create_context`, `_decompress`, `_compress`, `_get_block` are external and not shown, but their usage appears standard for a wrapper.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident in the visible code.\n- The `__exit__` methods are empty, which is acceptable if cleanup is handled elsewhere or not needed.\n- No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present.\n\n**Scores and their reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the benign analysis.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1 to 0.2), justified by the lack of external communication or malicious logic.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which matches the straightforward code.\n\n**Risk scores > 0.5 justification:**\n- No high-risk features are present. The code is a wrapper around trusted native functions, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The highest risk score is 0.2, which seems appropriate.\n\n**Malware score justification:**\n- Since no malicious activity or backdoors are detected, malware scores of 0 are justified.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about the internal functions' security, acknowledging that their implementation is not visible.\n- They correctly focus on the visible code and its structure.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis and code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- The code is a standard wrapper for LZ4 streaming compression/decompression.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n- The internal functions are external; their security depends on their implementation, but from this code alone, no issues are evident.\n- The context management methods are standard and do not introduce risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.1 — Minimal risk, primarily due to reliance on external functions whose security cannot be assessed here but are presumed safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, standard Python wrapper for LZ4 streaming compression/decompression. It does not contain malicious features, backdoors, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**My final assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis indicates a safe and well-structured implementation suitable for production use, assuming the underlying native functions are secure.",
