  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the provided context.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines classes for streaming compression and decompression using the LZ4 protocol.\n- It relies heavily on external internal functions: `_create_context`, `_decompress`, `_compress`, `_get_block`.\n- These functions are imported from an internal module `_stream`, whose implementation is not shown.\n- The classes manage context creation, resource management, and data flow, with standard exception handling.\n- No network activity, file I/O, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward wrapper for LZ4 streaming functions.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as a Python wrapper for LZ4 stream protocol.\n- **Assessment:** Finds no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; the code is a benign wrapper. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, describing the code as a wrapper for streaming compression/decompression.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, no suspicious code, straightforward implementation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Again, a wrapper for LZ4 streaming.\n- **Assessment:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no network activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, relies on trusted internal functions.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Well-reasoned; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar wrapper classes.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity, no suspicious code, safe delegation to internal functions.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, benign wrapper around native LZ4 functions.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The reliance on external functions `_create_context`, `_decompress`, `_compress`, `_get_block` is noted, but their implementation is not provided. However, their usage appears standard and safe.\n- The code does not handle sensitive data beyond compression/decompression, nor does it perform network or file operations.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, security risk: very low) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should be **0**; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be **0**; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's purpose and the absence of suspicious behavior, a **very low risk score (~0.1)** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0.1** |\n\nThe code is a standard, benign wrapper for LZ4 streaming functions. The external functions' security depends on their implementation, but based on the provided code and context, no malicious intent or security issues are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always verify the security of underlying native extensions, but within the scope of this code snippet, there are no concerns.",
