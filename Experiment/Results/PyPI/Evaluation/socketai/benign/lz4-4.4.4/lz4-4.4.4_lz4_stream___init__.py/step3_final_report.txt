{
  "purpose": "A Python wrapper for the LZ4 stream protocol, providing classes for streaming compression and decompression.",
  "sources": "Input data received via method parameters such as 'chunk', 'stream', 'dictionary'; internal context creation functions.",
  "sinks": "Processed output data returned by methods; no external sinks like network or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into compression/decompression functions, which utilize internal context; output data is returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual control flow detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for streaming compression/decompression, delegating core processing to external trusted functions. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or external communication are present. The context management methods are standard placeholders. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, wrapper nature of the code. The reliance on external functions means security depends on their implementation, but the wrapper itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured wrapper around trusted native functions for LZ4 streaming, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
