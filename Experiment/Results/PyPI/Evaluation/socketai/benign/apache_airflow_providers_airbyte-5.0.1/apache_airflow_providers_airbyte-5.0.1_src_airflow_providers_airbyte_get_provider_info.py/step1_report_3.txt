{
  "purpose": "This code provides metadata and configuration information for the Apache Airflow provider package for Airbyte, including package details, version history, integrations, operators, hooks, sensors, triggers, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is static configuration data returned by the get_provider_info() function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data or send it to external systems; it only returns a static dictionary.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input or data manipulation; the function simply returns predefined metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code constructs; the file contains standard license headers, descriptive comments, and a straightforward function returning static data.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of license headers, descriptive comments, and a single function that returns a static dictionary with package metadata. It does not perform any input/output operations, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The data appears to be static configuration information for a Python package. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity are present. The structure and content are consistent with auto-generated package metadata files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated metadata provider for the Apache Airflow Airbyte provider package. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security risks. The code serves a purely informational purpose.",
