  "purpose": "Provides static metadata information about the 'apache-airflow-providers-airbyte' package, including versions, integrations, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static data returned by the function get_provider_info().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the function only returns a predefined dictionary.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static function returning a hardcoded dictionary with package metadata. It contains no dynamic input, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code. The comments clarify it is auto-generated. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, which aligns with the code's static and benign nature. The confidence score is 1, reflecting certainty about its safety. Overall, the code is a benign, static configuration artifact with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static metadata provider with no malicious intent or activity. All reports correctly identify this, and the current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
