  "purpose": "Provides metadata and configuration information for the apache-airflow-providers-airbyte package, including version info, integrations, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The function get_provider_info() which returns a static dictionary with package details.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static return data, no external data handling or output.",
  "flows": "Function call to return static package info; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscated code. The code is a straightforward static data provider.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single function that returns a static dictionary containing package metadata such as name, versions, dependencies, and integrations. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or dynamic behaviors. The structure appears typical for a generated metadata module. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static metadata provider for the Apache Airflow Airbyte provider package, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a generated, non-malicious configuration script.",
