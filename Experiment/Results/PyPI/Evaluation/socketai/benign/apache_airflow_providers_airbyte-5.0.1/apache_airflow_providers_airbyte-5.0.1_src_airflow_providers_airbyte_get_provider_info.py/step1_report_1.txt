  "purpose": "This code provides metadata and configuration information for the 'apache-airflow-providers-airbyte' package, including version history, integrations, operators, hooks, sensors, triggers, connection types, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The function get_provider_info() returns a static dictionary; data is hardcoded within the code itself.",
  "sinks": "There are no dynamic inputs, user data, or external data sources involved in this code.",
  "flows": "The function returns a predefined dictionary; no data flow from external sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward and static, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function returning a static data structure containing package metadata. It includes version info, integration details, and dependencies. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic operations. The structure appears consistent with a typical package metadata script. No signs of malicious code, external data handling, or obfuscation are present. The comments clarify that the file is automatically generated and should be overwritten, indicating it is a standard, controlled artifact.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious metadata provider for an Airflow package. No suspicious activity, malware, or security risks are detected based on the content. It appears safe and legitimate.",
