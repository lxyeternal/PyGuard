  "purpose": "Provides metadata information about the apache-airflow-providers-airbyte package, including versions, integrations, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data within the get_provider_info() function, including package details, version list, and integration info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not handle external input or output sensitive data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the function returns static configuration data only.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be automatically generated and contains no dynamic or suspicious operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function returning a dictionary with static metadata about the package. It contains version info, integration details, dependencies, and documentation URLs. No input/output handling, no external data fetching, and no malicious code patterns observed. The code structure is straightforward and primarily informational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated metadata function providing package info. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It is safe for use.",
