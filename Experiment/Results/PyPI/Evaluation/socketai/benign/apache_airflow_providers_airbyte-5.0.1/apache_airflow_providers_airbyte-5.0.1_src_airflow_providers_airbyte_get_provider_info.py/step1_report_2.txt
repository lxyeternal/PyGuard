  "purpose": "Provides metadata and configuration details for the 'apache-airflow-providers-airbyte' package, including version info, integrations, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from predefined static dictionaries and lists within the function get_provider_info(). No external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to or send data to external systems or untrusted destinations.",
  "flows": "The code solely returns static data; there are no data flows from sources to sinks, nor any data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual logic, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. It is a straightforward static configuration script.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function returning a static dictionary with package metadata, version lists, and integration info. It does not process external input or perform network operations. It appears to be an auto-generated configuration file with no signs of obfuscated code or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated configuration data provider with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely supplies package metadata without external data handling or code execution.",
