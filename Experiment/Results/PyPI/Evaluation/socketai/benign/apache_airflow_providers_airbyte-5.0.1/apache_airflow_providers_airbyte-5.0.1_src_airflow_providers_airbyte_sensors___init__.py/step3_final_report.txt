  "purpose": "This code contains only license headers and comments, serving as legal and attribution information.",
  "sources": "The header comments and license notices within the code file.",
  "sinks": "There are no data inputs, outputs, or untrusted data flows; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data or control flows exist beyond static comments; thus, no source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or embedded malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license and copyright comments with no executable code or dynamic content. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of these headers, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, benign content. Confidence levels are high, and no issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard license header with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
