  "purpose": "This code contains only licensing header comments with no executable code or data handling.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only static comments present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; comments do not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward licensing comments with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a licensing header comment, standard in open-source projects. It contains no executable code, no data input/output, and no logic that could be malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified. The confidence level is high (1) due to the simplicity and clarity of the content. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present, and the content poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign licensing boilerplate with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores and assessments across all reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
