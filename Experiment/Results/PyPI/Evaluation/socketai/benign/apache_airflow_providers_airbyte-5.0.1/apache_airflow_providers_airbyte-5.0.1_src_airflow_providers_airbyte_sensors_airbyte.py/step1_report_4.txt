{
  "purpose": "This module defines an Airbyte job sensor for monitoring the status of Airbyte data pipeline jobs within an Airflow environment.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration values (deferrable, timeouts), job details via AirbyteHook.get_job_details(), and context parameters.",
  "sinks": "Raises exceptions on job failure, cancellation, or unexpected states; logs information about job status.",
  "flows": "Fetch job details from Airbyte API -> Check job status -> Raise exception or log success -> Defer if in deferrable mode -> Handle trigger events.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present. No obfuscated or unusual code constructs. No dynamic code execution or network communication observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an Airbyte job sensor for Airflow, with appropriate handling of job states and deferral logic. It uses configuration and API hooks securely, raises exceptions on failure states, and logs progress. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code does not contain obfuscated parts, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. It is consistent with typical workflow sensor implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured Airbyte job sensor without malicious intent. It performs monitoring tasks with no indications of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
