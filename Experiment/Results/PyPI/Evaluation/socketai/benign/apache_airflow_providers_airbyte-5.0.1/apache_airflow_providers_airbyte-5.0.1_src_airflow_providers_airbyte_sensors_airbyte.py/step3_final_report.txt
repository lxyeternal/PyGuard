{
  "purpose": "Monitor the status of a previously submitted Airbyte job within an Airflow environment, polling for completion, failure, or cancellation.",
  "sources": "API call via AirbyteHook to fetch job details using job ID.",
  "sinks": "Exception handling on job failure or cancellation; logging on success.",
  "flows": "Source: API request to get job status; Sink: raise exceptions or log completion; flow includes polling and deferral for asynchronous execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Airflow sensor pattern for monitoring external Airbyte jobs. It uses configuration parameters, external API calls, and exception handling appropriately. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The logic is straightforward, with clear status checks and deferral support. External API interactions are typical and do not introduce significant security risks. The code's structure and behavior align with best practices for such sensors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation of an Airflow sensor for Airbyte jobs. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with external API interactions. No modifications are necessary.",
