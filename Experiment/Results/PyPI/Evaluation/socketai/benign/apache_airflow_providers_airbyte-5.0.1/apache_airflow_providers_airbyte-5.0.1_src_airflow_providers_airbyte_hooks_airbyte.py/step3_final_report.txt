  "purpose": "A Python class implementing an Airbyte API client for Airflow, managing connections, job status, and health checks.",
  "sources": "Connection parameters fetched from Airflow's connection system; API responses from Airbyte API calls.",
  "sinks": "API responses used for job details, status, and health; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Fetch connection info -> create API session -> perform API calls (get_job, create_job, cancel_job, health check) -> handle responses and exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client for Airbyte within Airflow, securely obtaining credentials from external connection management, with proper exception handling. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are present. The code's purpose is clear, and it interacts with external APIs in a typical manner. The malware score is 0 due to absence of malicious patterns. The obfuscated score is 0 as the code is straightforward. The security risk score is low (around 0.1-0.2), justified by external API interactions but no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of an Airbyte API hook for Airflow, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assessments provided are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
