  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard autogenerated Python module for an Apache Airflow provider package.\n- It performs a straightforward version check, importing `packaging.version` and `airflow.__version__`.\n- It raises a RuntimeError if the current Airflow version is below 2.9.0.\n- The `__version__` string is hardcoded as \"5.0.1,\" which appears to be a normal package version.\n- No external network activity, data processing, or sensitive operations are present.\n- No obfuscated, suspicious, or malicious code is detected.\n- The code is well-structured, with comments indicating it is autogenerated and should be modified via templates.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with a couple of reports assigning 0.1. The minor increase appears to be due to the version check, but this is a standard practice and not a security risk.\n- **Logic and reasoning:** The logic is sound, and the reasoning is consistent with best practices for dependency validation.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or handle credentials.\n- The version check is a common pattern to enforce environment compatibility.\n- The hardcoded version string is typical and not suspicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are accurate; the code is benign.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable.\n- No changes are necessary based on the current analysis.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (standard dependency check with no security implications)\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical, safe version validation snippet, with no security concerns.",
