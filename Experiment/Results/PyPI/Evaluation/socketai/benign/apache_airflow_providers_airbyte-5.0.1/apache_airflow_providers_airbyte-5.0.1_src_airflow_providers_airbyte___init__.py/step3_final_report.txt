{
  "purpose": "This code performs a version check for the apache-airflow-providers-airbyte package, ensuring the installed Airflow version meets the minimum requirement of 2.9.0. If not, it raises a RuntimeError to prevent incompatibility issues.",
  "sources": "Reads the current Airflow version from airflow.__version__",
  "sinks": "Raises RuntimeError if the version is below 2.9.0, halting execution",
  "flows": "Imports airflow.__version__, compares it with '2.9.0', and raises an error if the condition is not met",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for dependency validation",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard autogenerated dependency validation script. It imports necessary modules, retrieves the current Airflow version, and compares it against a minimum required version. If the environment does not meet the requirement, it raises a RuntimeError. The version string is hardcoded as '5.0.1', which is typical for package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling. The logic is simple, clear, and follows best practices for dependency enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard version check without any malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, with no suspicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (0.1), reflecting the minimal risk associated with version validation logic.",
