{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to set version compatibility checks for an Apache Airflow provider package and ensure proper environment setup.",
  "sources": "Reads the imported modules (packaging.version, airflow.__version__) and the environment variable 'airflow_version'.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the RuntimeError raised if the airflow version is below 2.9.0, which is a standard exception to enforce version compatibility.",
  "flows": "Sources (imported modules and environment variable) -> Version parsing and comparison -> Potentially raising RuntimeError.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated behavior. The version check logic is straightforward and standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version parsing utilities, reads the current Airflow version, compares it with a minimum required version, and raises an exception if the requirement isn't met. It is a common pattern for dependency validation. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or backdoors. The license and documentation comments are standard and do not impact security. The version string '5.0.1' is hardcoded but appears to be a normal package version, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard version validation for package compatibility. No malicious intent or suspicious activity is evident. The logic is straightforward, and there are no indicators of security risks or malware.",
