{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of an auto-generated Python module related to Apache Airflow providers, specifically handling version checks and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (airflow.__version__), imports modules (packaging.version), and reads the package version string (__version__).",
  "sinks": "Raises a RuntimeError if the airflow version is below 2.9.0, which is a control flow that depends on the version check.",
  "flows": "Imports airflow version -> compares parsed version -> raises error if condition met.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs straightforward version checking and module metadata handling. The comment about the file being automatically generated suggests standard code generation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and checks if the installed Airflow version is at least 2.9.0. It raises a RuntimeError if the version requirement isn't met. The version string __version__ is hardcoded. The code is well-structured and follows standard practices. No suspicious imports, no data leaks, no embedded malicious code or backdoors, and no obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version check and metadata module for an Apache Airflow provider package. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
