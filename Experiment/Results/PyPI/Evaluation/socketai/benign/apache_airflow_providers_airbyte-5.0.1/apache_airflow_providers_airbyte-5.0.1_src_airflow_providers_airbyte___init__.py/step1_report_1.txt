{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an autogenerated module for an Apache Airflow provider package, mainly performing version checks and imports related to airflow and packaging modules.",
  "sources": "Reading the airflow version via __version__ and importing 'packaging.version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks. No external network or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Airflow version is retrieved and parsed; a version comparison leads to a RuntimeError if conditions are not met.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; the code performs standard version validation. The __version__ string is hardcoded but this is typical for package versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard autogenerated Python module for a package, with imports and version validation logic. It checks if the current airflow version is at least 2.9.0, raising an error otherwise. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code contains no obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or credential handling. The version check is straightforward and does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving primarily as a version validation and import setup for an airflow provider package. It contains no malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
