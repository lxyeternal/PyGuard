  "purpose": "Define and enforce version compatibility for the apache-airflow-providers-airbyte package.",
  "sources": "Imports from packaging.version, airflow.__version__",
  "sinks": "Runtime exception if version check fails",
  "flows": "airflow_version -> version comparison -> potential RuntimeError",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward version check and exception raising",
  "analysis": "The code imports version parsing utilities and the airflow version, then compares the current airflow version with a minimum required version (2.9.0). If the current version is below the threshold, it raises a RuntimeError to prevent incompatible package usage. The logic is simple, direct, and does not involve handling untrusted data or performing suspicious actions. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or network operations. The comments clarify that this is an automatically generated file and should be modified via templates, not directly. Overall, the code performs a standard version check with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign version check for package compatibility, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions as expected for version enforcement and does not contain any malicious or suspicious code.",
