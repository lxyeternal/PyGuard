  "purpose": "This code is part of a package initialization script that verifies the version of Apache Airflow and sets package metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ import annotations, packaging.version, airflow.__version__",
  "sinks": "The version comparison and the RuntimeError raise if version requirements are not met",
  "flows": "Imports -> version check -> potential RuntimeError raise",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. The version string is hardcoded but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for version handling and performs a version check on airflow. If the airflow version is below 2.9.0, it raises a RuntimeError to enforce version compatibility. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. It is part of standard package validation logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script that enforces version compatibility. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected. The code is clean, readable, and performs a legitimate check.",
