  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and determine the accuracy of their assessments, especially regarding malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: Correctly identifies that the code is a parameter utility for Airtable API, handling flexible input formats, encoding, and dynamic parameter discovery.\n- **Code Presence**: The classes and methods described are present and function as described.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation**: No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk**: None evident.\n- **Conclusion**: Accurate. The report correctly states the code is safe, well-structured, and standard.\n\n**Score Justification**: Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.5 (or lower). No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Recognizes the parameter classes, with a focus on the potential for user input in formulas.\n- **Code Presence**: The `from_name_and_value` method constructs formulas from user input, which could be misused if input is malicious.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation**: No malware or obfuscation; formula string construction is standard.\n- **Security Risk**: Slightly elevated (0.2) due to potential misuse of formula strings, but this is normal for formula generation.\n- **Conclusion**: Fair assessment; no malicious intent detected.\n\n**Score Justification**: Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Finds the code well-structured, safe, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Code Presence**: All described classes and methods are present.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation**: None detected.\n- **Security Risk**: Very low, as the code is purely parameter formatting.\n- **Conclusion**: Accurate.\n\n**Score Justification**: Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to previous, emphasizes safe parameter handling.\n- **Code Presence**: All features match.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation**: No issues.\n- **Security Risk**: None.\n- **Conclusion**: Correct.\n\n**Score Justification**: Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Correctly describes the purpose and behavior.\n- **Code Presence**: Matches the code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation**: No malicious elements.\n- **Security Risk**: Zero.\n- **Conclusion**: Accurate.\n\n**Score Justification**: Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports agree there is no malware present. I concur. The code is purely for parameter formatting and handling.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: No obfuscation detected in any report or code.\n- **Risk Score**: The only slight concern is the `from_name_and_value` method in `FormulaParam`, which constructs formulas from user input. While it sanitizes quotes, this is a standard practice and not malicious. The risk is minimal and aligns with normal formula usage.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware**: **0** (No malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated**: **0** (Clear, readable code with no obfuscation)\n- **Security Risk**: **0.1 to 0.2** (Very low; mainly due to formula string construction, which is a normal feature)\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is a standard, safe utility for constructing API parameters with no supply chain security issues or malware. The minor concern about formula string creation is normal and does not elevate the risk significantly.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: ~0.1–0.2 (considering the formula string construction, but it's standard and safe)\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more conservative or aggressive scoring approach.",
