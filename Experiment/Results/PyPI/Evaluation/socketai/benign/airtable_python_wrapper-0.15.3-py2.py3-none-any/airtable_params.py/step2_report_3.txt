  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the consistency of their scores, and any potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides parameter classes for Airtable API, with no suspicious or malicious code detected. The only noteworthy aspect is regex escaping in formulas, which is standard.\n\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, network calls, or obfuscated code. The code is purely about formatting request parameters.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0 — **appropriate**. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No security concerns here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the potential for misuse in the formula string construction via `from_name_and_value`. However, it notes that this is a normal feature and not malicious.\n\n- **Findings:** The only potential concern is the formula string creation, which could be misused if user input is maliciously crafted, but this is inherent to formula usage.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2 — **reasonable**, considering the formula string creation could be misused if inputs are malicious, but not inherently malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is cautious but fair. No actual malware or backdoors detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is standard parameter formatting logic.\n\n- **Findings:** No network, file, or system modifications. The only dynamic aspect is the formula string, which is sanitized.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. The code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. Focused on safe parameter handling.\n\n- **Findings:** No external data flows or system interactions. The formula escaping is standard.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing safe parameter handling. No malicious activity.\n\n- **Findings:** No network or file I/O, no obfuscation, no malicious payloads.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which aligns with the code's content—no malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation in securityRisk (0.2 in report 2, others at 0), which is reasonable given the formula string construction that involves user input. Since no actual malicious activity is present, these are acceptable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The formula string construction via `from_name_and_value` is a potential vector if user input is malicious, but the code sanitizes string values with regex substitution, which mitigates injection risks.\n\n- The overall code is a standard parameter utility module for API requests, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — minimal risk due to formula string handling, but well within safe bounds.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code appears safe, well-structured, and appropriate for its purpose. The minor concern about formula string input is addressed by sanitization, and no malicious activity is evident.",
