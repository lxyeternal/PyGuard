  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides parameter classes for Airtable API, with no malicious code or suspicious behavior. The regex in `from_name_and_value` is for escaping quotes in formulas, a standard practice.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — appropriate, no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence in assessment.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate; the code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code constructs API parameters; potential sink is in `to_param_dict` where untrusted data could be injected. The `from_name_and_value` method creates formula strings that could be misused if user input is malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware, but potential for misuse if user input is malicious.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to the possibility of formula injection if user input is malicious.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence, with awareness of potential misuse.\n\n**Note:** The potential for formula injection exists but is part of normal formula usage; no malicious code or backdoors are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with emphasis on safe parameter formatting. No network or system interactions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with standard parameter handling.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles parameters securely; no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Conclusion:** Safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with no malicious activity. The only concern is the formula escaping, which is standard and safe.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code. The only minor concern is the formula string construction, which is a standard sanitization method and not malicious.\n- **Obfuscated:** None of the reports detect obfuscation; code is clear.\n- **Risk scores:** The small security risk in report 2 (0.2) is justified due to potential formula injection if user input is malicious, but this is a known and expected behavior in formula handling, not an actual vulnerability or malware.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, primarily theoretical risk if user input is maliciously crafted, but not an actual vulnerability.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured parameter utility for Airtable API interactions. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The small potential for formula injection is a normal aspect of formula handling, not an indication of malicious intent.",
