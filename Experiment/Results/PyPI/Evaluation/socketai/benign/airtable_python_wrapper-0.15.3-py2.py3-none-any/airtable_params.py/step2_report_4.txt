  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details, potential risks, and consistency with the code.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes that the code is a standard parameter utility for Airtable API requests, with no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It notes the regex escaping in formulas as standard and harmless.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. This seems appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Justification:** The code only handles parameter formatting; no network, file, or malicious code is present. The regex used is for escaping quotes in formulas, which is normal.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** The report recognizes the potential for misuse in the `from_name_and_value` method, which constructs formula strings from user input. It correctly notes that this could be a vector if user input is maliciously crafted but emphasizes that no malicious behavior is present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. The small security risk score reflects the potential for formula injection if user input is malicious, but since the code does not execute or send data externally, this is a low risk.\n- **Justification:** The main concern is the formula string construction, which could be exploited if user input is malicious, but this is typical for formula generation. No network or file operations are involved.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** The report finds the code to be purely parameter formatting with no malicious behavior or backdoors. It emphasizes the absence of obfuscation, external calls, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. This aligns well with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no external data sinks or malicious features.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, it concludes the code is a safe utility for request parameter construction, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. This seems reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The code's sole purpose is parameter formatting; no network or system modifications are present.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the report emphasizes the code's role in safe parameter construction, with no malicious behavior. It notes the escaping in formulas as standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious payloads or suspicious operations are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified. The code does not contain any malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The only point of concern is the potential for formula injection via `from_name_and_value`. While this is a normal feature, if user input is maliciously crafted, it could lead to formula injection issues. However, since the code does not execute or send these formulas externally, the actual security risk remains minimal.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** Considering the potential for formula injection if user input is malicious, but no active exploitation, a risk score of around **0.1 to 0.2** seems appropriate. The current score of 0.2 in report 2 is reasonable.\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a legitimate, well-structured parameter utility for Airtable API requests.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The only minor concern relates to formula string construction, which could be exploited if user input is malicious, but this is a common and documented behavior in such APIs.\n\n**Final Malware Score:** 0  \n**Final Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Final Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (rounded to 0.2 in reports, which is acceptable)\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more conservative or aggressive scoring approach, but based on the analysis, the current assessments are justified.",
