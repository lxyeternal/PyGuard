{
  "purpose": "This code provides parameter classes for constructing Airtable API query parameters, including handling different input formats and encoding rules.",
  "sources": "Parameters are received through class instantiation (__init__ methods) such as MaxRecordsParam, ViewParam, FormulaParam, OffsetParam, FieldsParam, and SortParam.",
  "sinks": "The code converts input parameters into dictionaries suitable for URL encoding, primarily returning dictionaries from to_param_dict methods. No direct sinks for untrusted data are evident beyond standard data formatting.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed during class instantiation, processed in to_param_dict or __init__, and stored as class attributes. These values are then retrieved via _get and _discover_params methods for further use in API requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code uses regex substitutions in from_name_and_value but only for string escaping in formulas. No network, file, or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of parameter classes for the Airtable API, with methods to convert user inputs into URL parameters. It handles multiple input formats, including lists, strings, and tuples, to ensure flexible parameter passing. The _discover_params method dynamically creates a mapping of parameter class keywords, supporting both snake_case and camelCase. No external data or network interactions are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation of request parameter handling without any malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured parameter utility for Airtable API requests, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network, file, or environment manipulations. The only notable aspect is the regex escaping in formula strings, which is a standard practice. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
