  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility for constructing Airtable API parameters. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities. The minor potential for formula injection is a known aspect of formula handling and is mitigated by input sanitization. Overall, it poses minimal security risk."
