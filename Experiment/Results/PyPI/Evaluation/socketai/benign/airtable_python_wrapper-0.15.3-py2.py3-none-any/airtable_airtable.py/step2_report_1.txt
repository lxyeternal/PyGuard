  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the validity of their assessments, the consistency of their scores, and any potential issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report states the code is a standard Python wrapper for Airtable, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. It notes proper error handling, rate limiting, and safe data processing.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning appears sound. No suspicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are detected. The high confidence (0.95) aligns with the thorough analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a standard API wrapper with no malicious behavior. Slight concern about untrusted data (formulas, record IDs) but considered standard and not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The security risk score of 0.2 reflects a minor concern about unvalidated user input possibly leading to malformed requests, but not malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, confirms the code is a typical API client with proper rate limiting, no malicious activity, and no obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports. The security risk score remains appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same conclusion—standard API wrapper, no malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the previous reports.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Reiterates that the code is a straightforward API wrapper with no malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. Highlights proper handling and standard practices.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's nature as an API wrapper with no suspicious or malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, standard code.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly elevated (0.2) in some reports, reflecting minimal concern about untrusted input leading to malformed requests but not malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, standard code with no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.2** — Slight concern about unvalidated user input potentially causing issues, but not malicious.\n\n**Note:** The code appears to be a well-structured, open-source API client for Airtable, with appropriate error handling, rate limiting, and parameter processing. No evidence suggests malicious intent or activity.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified based on the code review. No adjustments are necessary.",
