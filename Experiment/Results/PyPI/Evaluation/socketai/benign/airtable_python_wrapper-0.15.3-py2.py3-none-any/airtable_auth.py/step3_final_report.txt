  "purpose": "Defines a custom requests authentication class that injects an API key as a Bearer token into request headers for Airtable API access.",
  "sources": "The api_key provided during class instantiation, used in the __call__ method to update request headers.",
  "sinks": "The request.headers dictionary where the Authorization header is added, influencing outgoing HTTP requests.",
  "flows": "The api_key flows from __init__ to __call__, where it is formatted and inserted into request headers before transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard pattern for API key injection via a custom AuthBase class. It securely accepts an external API key, avoiding hardcoding. No obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are present. The header update is a typical operation. External API key management remains a security concern but outside the scope of this code. The code's simplicity and adherence to best practices indicate no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for API authentication. No malicious behavior or security flaws are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal external API key handling concerns. The confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9-1).",
