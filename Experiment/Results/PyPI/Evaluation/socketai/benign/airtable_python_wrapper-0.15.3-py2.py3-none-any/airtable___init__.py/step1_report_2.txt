{
  "purpose": "Import the Airtable class from a local module named airtable, likely for data interaction or API communication.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .airtable import Airtable indicates reading the Airtable class definition from a local module file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet since there is no data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this minimal code snippet; it only imports a class definition.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no obvious anomalies. The import path is relative, which is standard for internal modules. No suspicious or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "This code imports a class named Airtable from a local module within the same package. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code is too brief to determine specific security concerns beyond the import itself. It appears to be a standard module import statement for internal use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement for an internal Airtable class. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
