  "purpose": "Importing the Airtable class from a local module for use in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing a local module 'airtable'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this single line; it is merely an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only a local import statement with no additional logic or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, which is a common practice. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The import statement itself is harmless and does not execute any code at runtime beyond loading the module. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are visible in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard import with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is a simple, benign statement.",
