  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .airtable import Airtable`.\n- The reports consistently identify this as a standard, benign import statement.\n- No data flows, sinks, or external inputs are involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1.0), indicating the reviewers agree on benignity.\n- Malware scores are all 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0.1 or 0), reflecting minimal concern.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code is a simple, standard import statement.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage.\n- No obfuscation or hidden code.\n- No external data sources or sinks.\n\n**Potential issues or considerations:**\n- Since the import is from a local module (`.airtable`), there is no external risk or network activity involved.\n- The only minor point is the use of a relative import, which is common in package code and not inherently suspicious.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk scores are very low, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the clarity of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their benign interpretation.\n- The import statement is standard and does not pose any security threat.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, standard code with negligible risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code snippet is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
