{
  "purpose": "This code snippet performs a relative import of the Airtable class from a local module, likely used for interacting with Airtable APIs or data structures.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output data, nor does it execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the import is static and does not involve runtime data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import of a class from a local module, with no data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution. All reviews correctly identify this as benign, with high confidence. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate given the minimal and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and poses no security threat. The scores are accurate and justified; no changes are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
