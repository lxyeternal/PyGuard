  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the airtable-python-wrapper library",
  "sources": "Constant assignments at the beginning of the file setting version, name, description, URL, author, email, license, and copyright",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no code execution or external data handling present",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; all assignments are straightforward metadata",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of variable assignments that store static package information. There are no data inputs, no code execution, and no dynamic behaviors. The metadata appears standard for a Python package setup. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are present. The code's structure and content are typical for defining package info.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only static metadata definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard package description snippet with no suspicious or harmful elements.",
