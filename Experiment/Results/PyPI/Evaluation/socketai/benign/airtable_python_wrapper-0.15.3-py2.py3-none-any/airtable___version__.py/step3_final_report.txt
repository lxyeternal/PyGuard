  "sources": "Assignment of static string variables (__version__, __name__, __description__, __url__, __author__, __authoremail__, __license__, __copyright__).",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static variable assignments without data flow or execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. There are no functions, data flows, external inputs, code execution, or dynamic behaviors. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, metadata-only, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the static, non-executable nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious elements are present, and the code poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, static package metadata snippet with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
