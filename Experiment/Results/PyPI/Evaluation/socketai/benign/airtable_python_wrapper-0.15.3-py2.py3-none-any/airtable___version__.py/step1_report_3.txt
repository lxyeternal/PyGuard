  "flows": "Initialization of metadata variables without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected; only metadata declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of metadata variable assignments with hardcoded string literals describing package info. No external input, network calls, or executable logic is present. This is standard package metadata setup, typical for Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to define package metadata with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
