  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code solely consists of static variable assignments. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or secret handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of variable assignments containing package metadata. No user input, external data processing, or network operations are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious activity. It serves as a standard package metadata declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely declarative, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
