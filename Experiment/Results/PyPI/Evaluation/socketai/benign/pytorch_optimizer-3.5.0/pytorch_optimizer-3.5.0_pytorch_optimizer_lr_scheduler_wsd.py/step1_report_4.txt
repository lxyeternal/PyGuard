{
  "purpose": "Provides a learning rate scheduler for training neural networks with warmup, stable, and decay phases, specifically implementing a cosine decay schedule.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through parameters such as current_step, optimizer, and training steps. It does not read external or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that leak data or execute untrusted code. The functions only perform mathematical calculations and configuration of a learning rate scheduler.",
  "flows": "The functions take parameters, compute a cosine-based decay value, and set up a learning rate scheduler, with no untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code uses standard mathematical functions and library calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for scheduling learning rates during model training using cosine decay with warmup and stable phases. It imports only standard Python and PyTorch libraries, and no external or untrusted sources. The functions are parameterized, and no dynamic code execution or data exfiltration is present. The partial function captures parameters for a lambda scheduler, which is a common pattern in deep learning workflows. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a cosine learning rate scheduler with warmup and decay phases. It appears to be legitimate, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
