{
  "purpose": "Provides a learning rate scheduler for training neural networks using a warmup-stable-decay cosine schedule.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters (current_step, optimizer, training steps, ratios), no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Uses mathematical functions and config parameters, no data sinks or external connections; no side effects observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> get_wsd_scheduler_lambda -> LambdaLR with partial function -> optimizer updates",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard learning rate scheduling logic without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for calculating learning rate schedules with warmup, stable, and decay phases. It utilizes standard math functions, the 'partial' function for creating a lambda-based scheduler, and the PyTorch library. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or external data interactions. The code appears to be a typical implementation of a custom learning rate scheduler for deep learning training routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a learning rate scheduler without malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard programming practices and PyTorch APIs for training model optimization. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
