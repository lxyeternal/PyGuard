  "purpose": "Implement a cosine decay learning rate scheduler with warmup and stable phases for PyTorch optimizers.",
  "sources": "current_step parameter in get_wsd_scheduler_lambda function",
  "sinks": "Return value of get_wsd_scheduler_lambda used in LambdaLR, affecting optimizer's learning rate",
  "flows": "current_step influences the output of get_wsd_scheduler_lambda, which is used by LambdaLR to adjust learning rate",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard libraries and practices; no obfuscation or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard cosine decay learning rate schedule with warmup and decay phases, using Python's math library and PyTorch's LambdaLR. It calculates learning rate scaling factors based on current training step, with parameters for warmup, stable, and decay durations, as well as minimum learning rate ratio and number of cosine cycles. The implementation is straightforward, parameterized, and employs common practices without obfuscation or malicious constructs. No external data, network activity, or side effects are present. The code's logic is correct and aligns with typical ML training routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a cosine learning rate scheduler with warmup and decay phases. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are justified and consistent with the code's functionality.",
