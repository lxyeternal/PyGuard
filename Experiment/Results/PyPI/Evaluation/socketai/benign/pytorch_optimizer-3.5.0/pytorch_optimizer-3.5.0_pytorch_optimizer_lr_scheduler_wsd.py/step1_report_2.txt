{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions to generate a cosine schedule for learning rate adjustment during training, including warmup, stable, and decay phases, using PyTorch's LR scheduler framework.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as current_step, optimizer, and configuration parameters for the schedule (num_warmup_steps, num_stable_steps, etc.).",
  "sinks": "Returns a learning rate schedule object (LambdaLR) that modifies the optimizer's learning rate based on the specified schedule.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → get_wsd_scheduler_lambda computes a float ratio based on current_step → get_wsd_schedule creates a partial function with schedule parameters → LambdaLR applies the schedule to the optimizer.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for implementing a cosine learning rate schedule with warmup, stable, and decay phases. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes common PyTorch functions and well-known scheduling techniques. The functions are straightforward, parameterized for flexibility, and follow typical patterns for learning rate scheduling. No input handling of untrusted data or network activity is present. No potential for malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a warmup-stable-decay cosine learning rate schedule using PyTorch, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
