{
  "purpose": "This code defines functions to generate a custom learning rate schedule for PyTorch optimizers, specifically implementing a warmup-stable-decay cosine schedule.",
  "sources": "Inputs include current_step, optimizer, and schedule parameters; code reads these values directly.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a LambdaLR scheduler object, which affects the optimizer's learning rate during training.",
  "flows": "current_step flows into get_wsd_scheduler_lambda to compute learning rate ratio, which is used by LambdaLR to update optimizer's learning rate.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; no network activity, data leakage, or system modification evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard cosine decay learning rate scheduler with warmup and stable phases. It uses only mathematical operations and PyTorch scheduler functions without external or hidden behaviors. There are no signs of malicious data handling, code injection, or sabotage. The structure and functions appear typical for ML training routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving to provide a customizable learning rate schedule for training neural networks. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on the code content.",
