  "purpose": "Implement a custom learning rate scheduler for PyTorch optimizers with warmup and cosine annealing features.",
  "sources": "Imports math, typing.List, Optional, and PyTorch optimizer and scheduler classes. Reads input parameters during class instantiation. Accesses optimizer.param_groups for setting learning rates. Uses math functions for calculations.",
  "sinks": "Sets 'lr' attribute in optimizer's param_groups, which influences training process. No untrusted data input or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Initializes 'lr' in init_lr(). During get_lr(), calculates learning rates based on internal state. During step(), updates internal state and recalculates 'lr' for each param group.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic. The code performs standard scheduler operations with mathematical calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a learning rate scheduler class with typical parameters and methods. It initializes learning rates, calculates scheduled learning rates with warmup and cosine decay, and updates parameters during training steps. All computations and method calls are standard for such a scheduler. No external input handling or data leaks are present. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a cosine annealing warmup scheduler for PyTorch. It performs normal mathematical computations for learning rate scheduling without malicious intent or security issues.",
