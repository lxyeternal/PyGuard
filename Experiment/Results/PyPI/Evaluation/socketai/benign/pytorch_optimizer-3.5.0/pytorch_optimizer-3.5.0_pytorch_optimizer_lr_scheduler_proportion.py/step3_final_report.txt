{
  "purpose": "Implements a proportional scheduler that computes a value scaled based on the current learning rate from an external scheduler object, intended for use in machine learning training routines.",
  "sources": "Reads learning rate from either 'lr_scheduler.last_lr' or 'lr_scheduler.optimizer.param_groups[0][\"lr\"]'.",
  "sinks": "Stores the computed proportional value internally in 'self.last_lr'; no external data transfer or output.",
  "flows": "Extracts learning rate -> computes scaled value -> stores in 'self.last_lr'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a scheduler component, reading the current learning rate from an external object, calculating a scaled value between 'min_value' and 'max_value', and storing it internally. No network activity, file I/O, or obfuscation is present. The logic is standard and safe. The only minor concern is reliance on external objects which could be maliciously crafted, but this is typical in such frameworks and does not indicate malicious intent within this code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard component for ML training routines with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 and low security risk, which aligns with the analysis. The code is safe and well-structured.",
