  "purpose": "Manage and retrieve learning rate schedulers for PyTorch, including filtering and loading functionalities.",
  "sources": "User input strings for scheduler names, internal dictionary lookups, and filtering functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input strings -> normalization to lowercase -> dictionary lookup -> filtered list generation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward enum, dictionary, and filtering logic with no suspicious code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enumeration for scheduler types, maps these to corresponding classes or functions, and provides functions to load schedulers by name and list supported schedulers with optional filtering. It performs safe string handling, dictionary lookups, and uses standard library functions for filtering. No external code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The filtering relies on fnmatch, which is safe, and the data flow is controlled. The overall structure is typical for configuration management modules in ML frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing learning rate schedulers with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate, and malware and obfuscation scores are zero. The assessments in the reports are accurate and justified.",
