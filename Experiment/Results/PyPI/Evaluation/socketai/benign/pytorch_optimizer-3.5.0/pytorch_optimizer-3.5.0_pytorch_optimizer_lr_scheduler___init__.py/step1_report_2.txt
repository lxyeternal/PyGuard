  "purpose": "Define and load various learning rate scheduler classes for use in training models, providing support for filtering and selection.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules and classes, and the function arguments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external output effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'lr_scheduler' flows through 'load_lr_scheduler' to map to a scheduler; 'filters' parameter in 'get_supported_lr_schedulers' is processed for filtering scheduler names.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed. All imported modules are standard or project-specific. The code mainly defines mappings and functions for scheduler management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enumeration for scheduler types, mappings from scheduler types to their implementations, and functions to load schedulers and filter available options. It includes standard error handling for unknown scheduler names. No external or untrusted data sources are involved. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for managing scheduler classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured scheduler management module with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It functions solely to map, load, and filter scheduler classes for training purposes.",
