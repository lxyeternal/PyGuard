{
  "purpose": "This code consists solely of import statements from the 'pytorch_optimizer' library, intended to load various loss functions, learning rate schedulers, and optimizers for deep learning training workflows.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'pytorch_optimizer' modules, which read static module data during execution.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; the code does not process external input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Static import statements load modules; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; no execution flow leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import statements with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of static import statements from a reputable open-source library. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with benign static imports. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is evident. The code is typical for setting up a machine learning training environment and does not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements from a trusted library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
