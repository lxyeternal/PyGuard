{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error conditions related to optimizer and learning rate configurations in machine learning code.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their initializers, which assign messages and notes for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks, no untrusted input processing or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with standard initialization of message strings. There are no functions accepting user input, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious code constructs. All classes extend from Python's built-in Exception and are used to represent specific error conditions. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of custom exception classes intended for error handling in a machine learning context. It contains no malicious code, no data leaks, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears safe and standard.",
