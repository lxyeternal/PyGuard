  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error conditions related to optimization procedures.",
  "sources": "No external data input; the code defines exception classes with hardcoded messages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks present; no external outputs or network interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly class definitions with message strings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Exception, with straightforward messages. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external interactions are present. The classes serve as structured error reporting for a larger system, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, structured exception classes intended for error handling within a larger application. No malicious behavior, security issues, or anomalies detected.",
