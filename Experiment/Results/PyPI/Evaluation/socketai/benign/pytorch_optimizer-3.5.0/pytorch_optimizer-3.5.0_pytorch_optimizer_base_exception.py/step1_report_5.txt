{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to optimizer parameters, such as sparse gradients, zero parameters, missing closure functions, negative learning rates, and negative steps.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters for error messages, such as optimizer names, notes, learning rates, and step counts.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or transmits data, nor does it process untrusted input beyond generating exception messages.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (optimizer_name, note, lr, num_steps) are used to construct exception messages; no data flows from external sources to critical sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual behaviors, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions for custom exceptions, each initializing an error message based on provided parameters. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The code appears to serve a utility purpose within a larger framework for optimizer validation or error handling, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of clean, standard exception classes used for parameter validation in a machine learning or optimization context. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
