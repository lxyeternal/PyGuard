{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for optimizer-related errors, such as sparse gradients, zero parameters, missing closure, negative learning rate, and negative steps.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to exception constructors (optimizer name, notes, learning rate, step count).",
  "sinks": "Error messages formatted from parameters; no untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into message strings during exception instantiation; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple, standard custom exception classes used for error handling in optimization routines. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. The messages are generated from parameters, which are presumably controlled within the application context. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is purely utility-based, and the implementation is clear and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
