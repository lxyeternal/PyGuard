{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for various error conditions related to optimizer parameters and training configurations.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; only exception message construction.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or untrusted data handling beyond exception message formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions in Python, used for error handling in a machine learning or optimization context. It defines exception classes with constructors that format error messages based on input parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code patterns. The code does not perform any network operations, data storage, or other potentially malicious activities. The structure is clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "This code is safe, serves a standard purpose of custom exception definitions, and contains no malicious or security-related concerns.",
