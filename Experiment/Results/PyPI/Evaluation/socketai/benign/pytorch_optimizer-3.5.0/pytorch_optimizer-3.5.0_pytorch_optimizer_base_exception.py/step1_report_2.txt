  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a machine learning or optimization framework.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; all data are internal parameters or messages.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages could potentially be used to influence error logs or error handling systems if misused, but no direct data leaks or malicious data handling are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; exceptions are raised with static or parameter-based messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code is straightforward class definitions for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception classes with descriptive messages. No external input is processed, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The classes are designed for error handling related to optimizer configurations and parameters, with no evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, benign exception class definitions for a machine learning framework. No malicious activity or security risks are identified.",
