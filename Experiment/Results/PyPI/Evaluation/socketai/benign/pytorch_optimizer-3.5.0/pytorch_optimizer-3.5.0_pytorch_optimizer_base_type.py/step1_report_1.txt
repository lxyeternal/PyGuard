  "purpose": "Define type aliases, literals, and import statements for a PyTorch-based optimization and scheduling framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements from typing and torch modules; variable and type alias definitions",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static type definitions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements and the definition of type aliases and string literals for use in a PyTorch training context. There are no functions, data processing, or runtime behavior. All elements are standard Python and PyTorch constructs for type safety and readability. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no data leakage or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, setting up types and constants for a PyTorch project. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
