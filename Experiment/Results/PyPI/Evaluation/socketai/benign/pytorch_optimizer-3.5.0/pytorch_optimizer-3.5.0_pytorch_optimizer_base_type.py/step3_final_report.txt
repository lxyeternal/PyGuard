  "purpose": "Type aliases, literal definitions, and import statements for a PyTorch-based framework, intended for type safety and clarity.",
  "sources": "Import statements and type alias/literal definitions; no runtime data handling or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data flow operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static type definitions with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, type aliases, and string literal definitions for a PyTorch ML project. There are no runtime behaviors, data processing, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The high confidence scores are justified, and no issues are identified that warrant concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as static type annotations and constants for a PyTorch project. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
