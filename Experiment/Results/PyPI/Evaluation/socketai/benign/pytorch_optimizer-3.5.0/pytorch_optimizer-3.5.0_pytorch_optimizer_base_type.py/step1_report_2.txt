{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and constants for a machine learning framework using PyTorch, including optimizers, schedulers, and data formats.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' and 'torch' modules; type alias definitions; constant string literals.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors detected. The code strictly defines type annotations and constants for type safety.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing and torch modules, then defines various type aliases and string literal constants related to machine learning workflows. No user input handling, network operations, file operations, or dynamic code execution present. It appears to be a standard type annotation setup for a machine learning project, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of type definitions and constants for ML code. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
