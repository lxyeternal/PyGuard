  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious or security-related issues, the validity of the scoring, and consistency across the reports.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as purely defining type aliases, string literals, and importing standard modules for a PyTorch ML framework.\n- No data processing, dynamic code execution, network operations, or untrusted input handling are present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is static, purely definitional, and intended for type safety and clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Security and Malware Scores\n\n**Malware Score (0):**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious intent or behavior. Given the code's nature—type aliases and constants—this is appropriate.\n\n**Security Risk Score (0):**  \nSimilarly, all reports assign a security risk score of 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Validity of the Scores and Analysis\n\n- The code is straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- The high confidence score (1) across all reports is justified, as the analysis correctly identifies the code as benign.\n- The obfuscated score (0) is correct, given the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- No report overstates the risk or malware potential.\n- The reasoning is sound: static type definitions pose no security threat.\n\n### Potential Changes to Scores\n\n- Since all evidence points to no malicious or security issues, **no changes are necessary**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reports correctly identify the code as purely definitional, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
