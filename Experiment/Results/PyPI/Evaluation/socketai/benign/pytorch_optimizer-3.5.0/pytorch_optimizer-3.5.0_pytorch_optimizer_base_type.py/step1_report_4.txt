  "purpose": "Define type aliases, constants, and literals for a machine learning framework involving PyTorch optimizers, schedulers, and data formats.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources; the code consists solely of type hints and constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; the code does not process or output data, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; purely type annotations and constants without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward collection of type aliases and literals meant for type checking and documentation. It imports standard Python and PyTorch modules, and defines various type constants for use elsewhere. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or data handling that could be malicious. It appears to be part of a larger project but contains no malicious behavior in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as type annotations and constants for a machine learning codebase. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are identified.",
