  "purpose": "Define type aliases and constants for PyTorch optimization and scheduling configurations.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and constant definitions for optimization, scheduling, and data formats.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code is primarily type definitions and constants.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only type aliases, Literal definitions, and imported modules relevant to PyTorch. There are no data inputs, network communications, or sensitive operations. No code execution, data handling, or external interactions are present. The code appears to be standard type annotations for clarity and type checking purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical set of type definitions and constants for a PyTorch-based project, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
