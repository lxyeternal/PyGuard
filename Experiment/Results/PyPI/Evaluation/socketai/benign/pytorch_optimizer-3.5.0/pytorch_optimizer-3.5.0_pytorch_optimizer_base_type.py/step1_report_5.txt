{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases, constants, and literal types for use in PyTorch-based optimization and scheduling code.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and import statements, particularly the 'typing' and 'torch' modules.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data sinks that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A — primarily type annotations and constants; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is standard for type hinting in a Python ML context.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines various type aliases and literal types relevant to PyTorch model training. No dynamic execution, data processing, or untrusted input handling is present. The constants and types are typical and do not introduce security risks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a straightforward type and constant definition module for use in other parts of a machine learning project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign configuration of type aliases and literals for a PyTorch ML project. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks.",
