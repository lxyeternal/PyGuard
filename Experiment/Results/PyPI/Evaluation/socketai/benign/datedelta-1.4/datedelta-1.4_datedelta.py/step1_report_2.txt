{
  "purpose": "Define an immutable class 'datedelta' for representing differences in years, months, and days, with arithmetic operations and compatibility with datetime.date objects.",
  "sources": "Imports 'datetime' and internal functions; class constructor parameters; property methods; magic methods (__add__, __sub__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "Potentially when __radd__ and __rsub__ are called with datetime.date objects, manipulating date objects based on internal 'datedelta' values.",
  "flows": "Input data (date, timedelta, parameters) flows through arithmetic or property methods to produce modified date objects or string representations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The code is a straightforward implementation of date difference handling with no hidden payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'datedelta' class that encapsulates differences in years, months, and days, ensuring immutability and hashability. It includes arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication), comparison, and string representations. The __radd__ and __rsub__ methods extend functionality to interact with datetime.date objects, allowing date adjustments based on 'datedelta'. No external inputs are processed directly, and there are no network calls, data leaks, or hidden code. The internal functions and constants are standard date calculations, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for date calculations with no malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is to provide a robust, immutable date difference class with various arithmetic capabilities. There are no signs of malware, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities.",
