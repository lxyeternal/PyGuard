  "purpose": "Define an immutable class 'datedelta' for representing date intervals in years, months, and days with arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Constants for time intervals (YEAR, MONTH, WEEK, DAY), internal functions _days_in_month and _s, and class methods accessing internal attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous operations include date arithmetic via __radd__ and __rsub__, which modify date objects using replace and timedelta.",
  "flows": "Input date objects through __radd__ and __rsub__, combined with internal interval attributes, produce modified date results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Arithmetic checks for signs are standard. The code operates only on date arithmetic and internal constants.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a 'datedelta' class for date interval representation with standard arithmetic operations and comparison methods. It ensures immutability and supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and integration with datetime.date objects. The methods __radd__ and __rsub__ adjust date objects by adding or subtracting the interval, using replace and timedelta. These operations are standard and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or data leaks. No network activity, file access, or external resource usage is present. The code does not contain obfuscated logic or malicious payloads. It primarily provides utility functions for date calculations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured utility class for date intervals with standard arithmetic operations. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior, and there is no evidence of supply chain threats or malware. It appears safe for use in a project. No security risks are identified beyond standard date arithmetic considerations.",
