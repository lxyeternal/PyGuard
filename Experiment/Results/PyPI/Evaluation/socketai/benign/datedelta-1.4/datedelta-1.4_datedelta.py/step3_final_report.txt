{
  "purpose": "A date delta utility class representing durations with years, months, and days, providing arithmetic operations and date adjustments.",
  "sources": "Constructor arguments (years, months, days), date objects in __radd__ and __rsub__ methods, internal functions for date calculations.",
  "sinks": "Uses date.replace() and datetime.timedelta() for date adjustments; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (constructor args, date objects) flow through arithmetic and date adjustment methods to produce new date objects or internal state.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward date arithmetic; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard, well-structured date delta class with input validation, immutable design, and safe date manipulations. It handles leap years and month lengths correctly. No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious behavior are present. The use of date.replace() and timedelta() is standard and safe. Minor concerns about date adjustments in __radd__ and __rsub__ are typical for such utilities and are handled carefully. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard date delta utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for supply chain use, with negligible security risk.",
