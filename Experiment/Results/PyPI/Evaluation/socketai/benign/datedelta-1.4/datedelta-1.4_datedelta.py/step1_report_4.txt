  "purpose": "Defines an immutable class 'datedelta' for representing date intervals with years, months, and days, along with various arithmetic and comparison operations.",
  "sources": "The class reads input from constructor parameters, property methods, and data involved in arithmetic operations (__add__, __sub__, __mul__), as well as date manipulations within __radd__ and __rsub__ methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points are the __radd__ and __rsub__ methods where untrusted datetime.date objects are modified or used in replace(), and where arithmetic with days is performed. These involve untrusted data flows if the input date objects are not trusted.",
  "flows": "Input from external date objects flows into __radd__ and __rsub__, which modify and return new date objects after adding/subtracting date deltas and days. The data flows from constructor parameters through properties into operations that modify dates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code uses custom date interval logic and standard datetime operations. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected. The helper function _s is simple. The use of assertions and explicit type conversions is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a date delta class with support for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and comparison. The methods __radd__ and __rsub__ adjust provided date objects by adding/subtracting years, months, and days, relying on the date.replace() method. These methods perform calculations that could, in rare cases, produce invalid dates if the adjustments are not handled carefully. However, the code includes logic to adjust months and handle days outside the valid range, reducing risks. There is no evidence of code injection, malicious data exfiltration, or backdoors. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or data leaks are present. The overall code is a self-contained implementation of date arithmetic without external dependencies or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured implementation of a date delta class with arithmetic operations. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The only potential concern is the manipulation of external date objects, but this is part of normal date arithmetic functionality. No security risks or malicious intent detected.",
