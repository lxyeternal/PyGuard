  "purpose": "This code sets up and configures the Python package 'datedelta' for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, version, description, long description, author info, URL, modules list, and Python version requirements.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process or handle untrusted input or data; it only uses predefined static data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the setup process involves only predefined metadata.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "This script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It imports the 'setuptools' library and defines package metadata, modules, and requirements. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or potentially malicious logic is present. The code is purely declarative, specifying package info for distribution purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks detected. It performs standard package configuration tasks securely.",
