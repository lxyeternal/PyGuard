  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'datedelta' Python package, providing package metadata and installation instructions.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and configuration data directly from variable definitions within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks related to untrusted input, external data, or sensitive data handling in this code.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves defining metadata and then passing it to the setup() function, with no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code solely performs package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup using setuptools, defining package information, modules, and dependencies. It does not include any dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious logic. The content appears to be documentation and metadata for publishing the package. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply defines package metadata and invokes setuptools.setup().",
