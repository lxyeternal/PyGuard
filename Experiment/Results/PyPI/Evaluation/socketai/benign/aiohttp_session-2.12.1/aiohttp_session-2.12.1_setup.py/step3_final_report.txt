{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'aiohttp-session' Python package, handling version extraction, dependencies, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__init__.py' using regex; reads README and CHANGES files; defines dependencies and package info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or external data sources; no network operations or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and documentation files; passes dependencies and metadata to setup() without external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'latin1' encoding for reading '__init__.py', which is benign but somewhat unusual; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no obfuscated or malicious code. It performs standard operations: reading static files, extracting version info via regex, and defining dependencies. There are no signs of network activity, code injection, or suspicious patterns. The version extraction and file reading are safe and common practices. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The dependencies are standard for a web package. Overall, the script is benign and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, secure setup script with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate, though a risk score of 0 would be slightly more accurate. Overall, the package is safe, and the assessments are consistent with the code's behavior.",
