  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, secure setup script with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate, though a risk score of 0 would be slightly more accurate. Overall, the package is safe, and the assessments are consistent with the code's behavior."
