  "purpose": "Set up configuration and dependencies for the 'aiohttp-session' Python package.",
  "sources": "File reading operations for '__init__.py', 'README.rst', and 'CHANGES.txt'; variable definitions for dependencies; version extraction from source code.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or input handling; package setup parameters are static or derived from source files.",
  "flows": "Reading version info from source file → Using file content to determine version → Package setup with static metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a version string from a source file, constructs dependency lists, and configures package metadata for setuptools. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. The file reading functions are straightforward, with no input from external untrusted sources beyond local files. The dependencies listed are common third-party packages. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It performs standard package setup tasks securely and transparently.",
