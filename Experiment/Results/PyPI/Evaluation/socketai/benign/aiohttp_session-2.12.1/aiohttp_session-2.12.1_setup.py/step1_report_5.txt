{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the 'aiohttp-session' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reading the '__init__.py' file to extract version, reading README and CHANGES files for long description, and static definitions of dependencies and package info.",
  "sinks": "Potential injection points include reading external files and processing version info, but no untrusted input is explicitly used for critical operations.",
  "flows": "File reading operations flow from filesystem to variables; dependencies are statically defined; no user input or network data is processed at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The version extraction is standard; no obfuscation or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup configuration for a Python package. It reads files to get the version and long description, sets package metadata, and defines dependencies. All operations are typical for Python packaging. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The risk score is minimal, with no suspicious activity detected.",
