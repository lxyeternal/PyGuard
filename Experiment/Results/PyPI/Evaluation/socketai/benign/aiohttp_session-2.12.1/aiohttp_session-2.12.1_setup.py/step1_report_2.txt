{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'aiohttp-session' Python package, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version from '__init__.py'; reading README.rst and CHANGES.txt files for long description; reading dependencies from predefined lists.",
  "sinks": "Reading files for version and long description; no untrusted data sinks or external command execution present.",
  "flows": "File reads for version and description → package setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. Usage of regex for version extraction is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads static files to gather metadata and dependencies, then calls setup() with this information. No untrusted inputs, network activity, or malicious code execution is present. The dependencies listed are typical for a Python package and do not suggest malicious intent. There is proper exception handling when reading version info, and no suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected operations for package configuration.",
