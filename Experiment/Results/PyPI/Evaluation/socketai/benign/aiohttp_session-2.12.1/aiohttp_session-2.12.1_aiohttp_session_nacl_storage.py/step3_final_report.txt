{
  "purpose": "Encrypted JSON session storage using NaCl's SecretBox, providing secure cookie-based sessions with encryption and decryption.",
  "sources": "Request cookies for encrypted data; external secret key for decryption; session data serialization.",
  "sinks": "Response cookies for storing encrypted session data.",
  "flows": "Load cookie from request -> decrypt and decode to session data -> create session; Save session -> serialize, encrypt, and store in cookie.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard cryptographic practices with proper nonce handling, error management, and JSON serialization. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The secret key is externally supplied, which is typical but relies on external secure management. Exception handling correctly manages decryption failures, defaulting to empty sessions. No obfuscation or code anomalies are present. The security and malware scores are consistent with the code's intent and implementation quality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation of encrypted session cookies using NaCl. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The risk score is low, primarily dependent on external key management. The reports are accurate and consistent; no modifications are necessary.",
