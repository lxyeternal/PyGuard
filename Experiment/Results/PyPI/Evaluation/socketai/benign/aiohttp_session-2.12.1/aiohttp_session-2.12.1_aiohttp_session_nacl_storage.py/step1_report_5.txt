  "purpose": "Implement secure cookie-based session storage with NaCl encryption in an aiohttp web application.",
  "sources": "Reads secret_key during initialization, reads cookie value during load_session, reads session data during save_session.",
  "sinks": "Decrypts cookie data with nacl.secret.SecretBox.decrypt, encrypts session data with nacl.secret.SecretBox.encrypt, writes encrypted data to cookies.",
  "flows": "Load cookie -> decrypt cookie data -> decode JSON -> create session; Save session -> encode session data -> encrypt -> set cookie.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; standard use of nacl library; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation; no external network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard cryptographic library (PyNaCl) for encrypting and decrypting session data, with proper use of secure secrets, nonces, and encoding. It handles exceptions appropriately during decryption failures. No input/output sources or sinks suggest malicious behavior, and no unusual or obfuscated code features are present. Overall, it appears to be a typical implementation of encrypted cookie storage with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements secure session storage with encryption; it does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears well-structured and consistent with best practices for cryptography and session handling.",
