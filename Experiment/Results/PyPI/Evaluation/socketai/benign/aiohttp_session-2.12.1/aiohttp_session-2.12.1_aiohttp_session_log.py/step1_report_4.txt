  "purpose": "Configure logging for the package using the logger associated with the current package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __package__ variable to obtain the package name for logging configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input is used in a way that could lead to data leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "N/A – No data flows from sources to sinks that could cause vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __package__ is normal for logging setup; no unusual or suspicious code features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger named after the current package using Python's standard logging module. There are no malicious or suspicious constructs; the code simply sets up logging context. No user input, environment variables, or external data is handled. The code is minimal and appears to serve a standard purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup for logging in a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
