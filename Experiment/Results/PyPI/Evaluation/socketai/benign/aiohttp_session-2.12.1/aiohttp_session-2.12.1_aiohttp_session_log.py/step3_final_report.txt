  "purpose": "This code initializes a logger for a Python package using the standard logging module.",
  "sources": "Import of the logging module, creation of a logger with __package__ as the name.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data flows, no outputs or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Import of logging -> creation of logger with __package__ -> no further data flows or data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module and creates a logger object using __package__, which is typical for Python package logging. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows that could be exploited. The code is minimal, clear, and does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate benign behavior. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless logging setup with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are justified. No further action or concern is necessary.",
