  "purpose": "Configuration script for building Sphinx documentation for the aiohttp_session project.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '__init__.py', importing modules, setting up sys.path, and reading configuration files.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or code execution points are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads the version info from a source file, sets up paths, and configures documentation generation parameters without executing untrusted data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors are detected. The code strictly performs configuration setup for documentation generation. No hardcoded credentials, malicious backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads version info from a file using regex, modifies sys.path, and sets configuration options for Sphinx documentation. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or data leaks. The regex used is safe, targeting a specific pattern for version extraction. The rest of the script only sets static configuration parameters for documentation purposes. No signs of obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs typical setup tasks without executing untrusted code or handling sensitive data.",
