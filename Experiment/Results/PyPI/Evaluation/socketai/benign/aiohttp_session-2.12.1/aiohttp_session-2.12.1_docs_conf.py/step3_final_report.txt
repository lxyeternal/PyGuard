  "purpose": "This code is a Sphinx configuration script for building documentation, primarily setting paths, extensions, and version info.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'aiohttp_session/__init__.py' using regex; modifies sys.path; static configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local file -> sets configuration variables -> no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward static configuration with safe regex parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static setup tasks for documentation generation. It reads version info safely, modifies sys.path in a standard way, and sets static parameters. There are no dynamic or untrusted data operations, no network calls, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The regex used for version parsing is simple and safe. Overall, the script is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
