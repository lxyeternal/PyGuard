  "purpose": "Configuration script for building documentation with Sphinx for the 'aiohttp_session' project.",
  "sources": "File system reads (os.path, codecs.open), regex searches, sys.path modification, static asset paths, and configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present. No network or data leaks are identified.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a local __init__.py file; configures paths and extensions; sets documentation parameters; loads static resources; configures HTML and other output options.",
  "anomalies": "None of the code performs any unusual activities. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. No obfuscation, malware signatures, or malicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily loads version info from a local file, configures Sphinx documentation parameters, and sets static and theme options. It does not include any code that reads untrusted input, communicates externally, or executes dynamic code. The regex usage is straightforward for version parsing, and path modifications are standard for Sphinx setups. No suspicious behavior or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file for documentation generation. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security assessment is very high confidence that this code is benign.",
