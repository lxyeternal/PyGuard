  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Sphinx configuration script.\n- The code reads version info from a local source file (__init__.py) using regex, which is common practice.\n- No untrusted data, user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The scores assigned are all zero for malware and security risk, and all reports have confidence=1.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues present in code?**  \n  No. The code performs static configuration tasks only.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  None. The regex is straightforward and safe, and no suspicious logic is present.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review:\n- The **malware score of 0** is appropriate; no malicious activity is detected.\n- The **obfuscated score of 0** is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The **security risk score of 0** is justified; the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n### Justification for high scores (if any):\n- None of the reports suggest any reason to assign higher scores. The code is a typical configuration script.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- Confirm that the code is safe for deployment and documentation generation.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nIf I were to assign my own scores based on the analysis, I would concur with the existing scores:  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a typical, safe configuration script with no security concerns.",
