  "purpose": "Define a type alias for an asynchronous function that takes an aiohttp web application and returns a TestClient.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'typing' and 'aiohttp' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code only defines a type alias.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for asynchronous web testing in Python. It defines a type alias 'AiohttpClient' for a function that accepts a web application and returns a coroutine yielding a TestClient. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or network activities. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and typical for test setups.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple type alias definition for testing purposes using aiohttp. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and poses no security risks.",
