  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward type alias definition for functions related to aiohttp testing.\n- No source, sink, or flow points suggest any data handling or malicious activity.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are noted.\n- The code imports standard modules and defines a simple type alias.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is purely declarative, serving as a type hint for functions that match a particular signature.\n- There are no executable statements, data processing, or external interactions.\n- The reported \"malware\" score is consistently 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score is also 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature and the code's purpose, I concur with the given scores.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score is 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation.\n- The \"malware\" score is 0, correctly reflecting no malicious behavior.\n- The \"risk\" score is 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard type alias definition for testing aiohttp applications.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious intent are present.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code snippet is safe, benign, and serves a development/testing purpose. No further action or concern is warranted.",
