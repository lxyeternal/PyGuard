  "purpose": "Define a type alias for an asynchronous function that takes a web.Application and returns a TestClient, used for testing aiohttp applications.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, aiohttp, and aiohttp.test_utils; no runtime data input or output.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "None; the code only defines a type alias without execution or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a straightforward type alias with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines a type alias for a function signature used in testing aiohttp web applications. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code is typical for type hinting and testing setups, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward type alias used for testing aiohttp applications. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and the current scores are appropriate and consistent with its nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
