  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the session management via encrypted cookies, matching the code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, proper cryptography, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-reasoned, high confidence, no malware, low risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is secure, with no malicious behavior. The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk is low (0.1). The obfuscated score is 0, matching the code clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correctly notes session management with NaCl encryption, matching the code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, standard cryptography, proper handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Consistent, thorough, no malware, low risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The malware score of 0 is justified. The overall security assessment aligns with the code. The risk score of 0.1 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Same as above, accurate.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity, standard practices, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate, consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** Malware score of 0 is justified. Risk score of 0.2 seems slightly higher but still low, considering the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, proper cryptography, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded.\n\n**Assessment:** Malware score remains 0. Appropriate. Risk score of 0.2 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Notes that nonces are generated securely, no suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified.\n\n**Assessment:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate. Risk score of 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious payloads are evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the code's clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are acceptable given the context. The code employs cryptography properly, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are observed.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, well-structured, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, considering the cryptographic practices and thorough testing.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears secure, with no indicators of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified based on the provided code and analysis.",
