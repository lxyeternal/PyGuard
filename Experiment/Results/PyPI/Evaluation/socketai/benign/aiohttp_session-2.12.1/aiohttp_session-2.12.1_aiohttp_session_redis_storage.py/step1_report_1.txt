  "purpose": "Implement a Redis-based session storage system for an aiohttp web application, managing session cookies and data serialization.",
  "sources": "Reading cookies from the request, generating session keys, encoding/decoding session data, interacting with Redis via get/set.",
  "sinks": "Redis get/set operations, saving cookies in HTTP response, decoding/encoding session data.",
  "flows": "Cookie read from request -> session key generation/lookup -> Redis get for session data -> session data decoding -> session saving -> Redis set with serialized data -> cookie saving in response.",
  "anomalies": "Use of uuid4 for session key generation is standard; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious external calls or code obfuscation; deprecation warning for aioredis is benign. No unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages sessions via cookies and Redis. It reads session cookies, retrieves session data from Redis, decodes it, and stores it back. The key factory generates session IDs without hardcoded secrets. Redis interactions are straightforward with no data leaks or injection points. No external network calls other than Redis. No suspicious or malicious logic present. The only potential concern is reliance on external Redis without validation, but this is standard practice. No backdoors or malware are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical, well-structured session management component using Redis. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are present. The implementation is standard and secure given proper Redis configuration.",
