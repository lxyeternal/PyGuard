  "purpose": "This code implements Redis-backed session management for aiohttp, handling session storage, retrieval, and cookie management.",
  "sources": "Cookies from HTTP request, Redis database via get/set operations, session data encoding/decoding functions.",
  "sinks": "Redis get/set commands, cookie setting functions, JSON decoding/encoding, potential decoding errors.",
  "flows": "Cookie read -> session key extraction -> Redis get (retrieve data) -> JSON decode -> session creation; session save -> JSON encode -> Redis set -> cookie update.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Warnings about deprecated aioredis are benign. No external network calls besides Redis, no backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of session storage using Redis. It generates session keys with uuid4, serializes session data with JSON, and interacts with Redis via get/set. Error handling for dependencies and data decoding is appropriate. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The deprecation warning for aioredis is benign. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on Redis configuration outside the code scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, aligning with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard Redis session backend with no malicious or supply chain risks detected. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
