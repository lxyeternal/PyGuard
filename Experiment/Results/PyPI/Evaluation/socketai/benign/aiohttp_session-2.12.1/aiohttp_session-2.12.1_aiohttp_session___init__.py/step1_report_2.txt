{
  "purpose": "Provides session management for aiohttp.web applications, including session creation, retrieval, and cookie handling.",
  "sources": "Request cookies, request attributes, in-memory session data, request handlers, and time functions.",
  "sinks": "Response cookies for session storage, in-memory session modifications, and time-based cookie expiry setting.",
  "flows": "Loading cookie data from request -> decoding -> creating session object -> modifying session -> encoding -> saving cookie into response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of json for encoding session data is standard, though insecure for sensitive data. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard session management, with functions to load and save session data via cookies, using JSON serialization. It ensures proper handling of session creation, expiration, and modification. The middleware correctly integrates with aiohttp, storing session state in request attributes and setting cookies in responses. No malicious or sabotage behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden network activity are evident. The storage implementation is simple and insecure for production, but intended for testing only. The code does not manipulate or access sensitive system resources maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical session management library with no apparent malicious intent or security sabotage. It securely manages session data via cookies, with appropriate flow control and error handling. No malicious behaviors or malware are detected.",
