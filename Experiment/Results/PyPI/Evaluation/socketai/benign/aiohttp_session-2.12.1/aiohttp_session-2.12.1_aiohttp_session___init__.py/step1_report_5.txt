{
  "purpose": "The code provides session management for aiohttp.web applications, including session creation, storage, and middleware setup.",
  "sources": "Input data from request cookies, environment variables (none in code), and parameters passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "Response cookies (set_cookie, del_cookie), potential data stored or retrieved in session objects, and possibly data serialization/deserialization.",
  "flows": "Request cookies → load_session / load_cookie → session data → save_session / save_cookie → response cookies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. Use of JSON serialization without encryption poses potential privacy issues but not malicious. No unusual code structures or obfuscation detected. No external network calls or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard session handling for aiohttp, using JSON for encoding session data stored in cookies. It handles session creation, loading, saving, and invalidation with appropriate checks for response state. No suspicious code paths, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. It strictly manages session data within the application scope, with no external network activity or security-critical vulnerabilities identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical, straightforward implementation of session management for aiohttp applications. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It focuses solely on session data handling with no harmful behaviors observed.",
