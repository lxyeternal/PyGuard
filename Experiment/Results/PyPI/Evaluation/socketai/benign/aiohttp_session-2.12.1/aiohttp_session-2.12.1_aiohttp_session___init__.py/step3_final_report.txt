  "purpose": "Provides session management for aiohttp.web using cookies and pluggable storage backends, enabling creation, retrieval, and persistence of user sessions.",
  "sources": "Request cookies (load_session), request.get for storage, internal session data (setitem, delitem), request cookies for load_cookie.",
  "sinks": "Cookie set_cookie/del_cookie in save_cookie, storage.save_session, response object for setting cookies.",
  "flows": "Request cookies -> load_session -> Session object -> modifications -> save_session -> set cookie in response.",
  "anomalies": "Uses JSON serialization without encryption or signing, making session data vulnerable to tampering; no cryptographic validation or integrity checks.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie-based session management with a pluggable storage interface. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The main security concern is the lack of encryption/signing of session data stored in cookies, which could allow tampering or session hijacking if sensitive data is stored. No suspicious network activity or code injection is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and follows common patterns, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward session management implementation. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or sabotage. The primary security issue is the insecure storage of session data via JSON in cookies, which should be addressed for sensitive data but does not constitute malicious activity.",
