{
  "purpose": "The code implements a session storage mechanism using Memcached for a web application, managing session data securely with cookie handling.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include cookies from incoming web requests and session data stored in Memcached. Environment variables are not used.",
  "sinks": "Data is stored in Memcached, and cookies are set in HTTP responses. No direct data leakage or system modification occurs.",
  "flows": "Session keys from cookies are retrieved, validated, and used as keys to get/set data in Memcached. Encoded session data flows from application to cache storage and vice versa.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are observed. Use of lambda for key_factory is safe. No obfuscation or hidden behavior identified.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages session data, generating session keys and encoding/decoding JSON data. It handles expiration correctly, considering maximum age. There are no signs of malicious data handling, code injection, or backdoors. No network connections beyond Memcached interactions, and no sensitive data exposure is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of Memcached-backed session management. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks within this module.",
