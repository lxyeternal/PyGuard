  "purpose": "Implement session storage and management using Memcached with secure cookie handling and expiration logic.",
  "sources": "Reading cookie from request; session data stored/retrieved from Memcached; session key generated via UUID; session data encoded/decoded with JSON.",
  "sinks": "Memcached set/get operations; cookie setting in response; session data serialization/deserialization.",
  "flows": "Cookie read -> session key retrieval -> Memcached get -> decode data -> session creation; session save -> encode data -> Memcached set; cookie update in response.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity beyond Memcached interactions; expiration logic correctly implemented; use of UUIDs for session keys is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of session management with Memcached, handling cookies securely, generating unique session IDs, and managing expiration properly. No malicious, suspicious, or obfuscated behavior is evident. The decoding and encoding are standard, with error handling for decoding failures. The use of a lambda for key generation and JSON for data serialization aligns with best practices. No anomalies or security flaws are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure session management component with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
