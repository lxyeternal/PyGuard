{
  "purpose": "Static version information retrieval generated by 'versioneer.py', containing version metadata in JSON format.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded JSON string 'version_json' within the code.",
  "sinks": "json.loads() function parsing the static JSON string.",
  "flows": "The code reads the static JSON string and passes it directly to json.loads() to produce a Python dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and generated for version tracking purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static JSON string with version info, imports json, and provides a function to parse and return this data. It involves no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be generated by 'versioneer.py' and serves as a benign version info provider. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. The confidence level is high (1), given the simplicity and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version info loader with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
