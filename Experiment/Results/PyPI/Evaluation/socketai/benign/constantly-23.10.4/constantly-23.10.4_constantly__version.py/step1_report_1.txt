  "purpose": "This code generates version information from a static JSON string, likely used for tracking or displaying package version details.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded JSON string assigned to the variable 'version_json'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any untrusted input/output operations or data leaks; it only loads JSON from a predefined string.",
  "flows": "The function get_versions() loads and returns data from the hardcoded JSON string 'version_json', with no external data or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the json module, defines a static JSON string with version metadata, and provides a function to parse and return this data. There are no external inputs, network communications, or dynamic code execution. The code is simple and serves a configuration or version-tracking purpose without any malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, standard version information retrieval from a hardcoded string. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
