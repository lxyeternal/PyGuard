{
  "purpose": "This code extracts version information generated by 'versioneer.py' from a JSON string.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded JSON string assigned to 'version_json'.",
  "sinks": "The code processes the JSON string with 'json.loads', converting it into a Python dictionary.",
  "flows": "The JSON string 'version_json' is parsed by 'json.loads' to produce a dictionary with version info.",
  "anomalies": "The JSON string is hardcoded; no external input or data is read. The code appears static and standard for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward. It defines a static JSON string with version info, then provides a function to parse and return this data. No user input, network access, or external data processing occurs. The structure and content are typical for auto-generated version info files. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple version info loader generated by 'versioneer.py'. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified.",
