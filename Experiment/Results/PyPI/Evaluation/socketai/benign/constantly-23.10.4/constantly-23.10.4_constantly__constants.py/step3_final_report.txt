{
  "purpose": "The code implements a framework for defining symbolic constants, including support for ordering, comparison, and bitwise operations, using classes, metaclasses, and operator overloading. It manages collections of named, valued, and flag-based constants.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions within subclasses of _ConstantsContainer, internal dictionaries (_enumerants), and class-level attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, output, or network communication; internal class and data structure manipulations only.",
  "flows": "Internal class attribute access and method calls, with no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code segments detected. The code uses standard Python features and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a structured constants management system with metaclasses to enforce constant collection creation. It supports comparison and bitwise operations for flag constants. No external data sources, network activity, or system modifications are present. The implementation is straightforward, with clear class hierarchies and no obfuscation or malicious behavior. Static analysis indicates no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured constants framework with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use in larger projects, with scores reflecting no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns.",
