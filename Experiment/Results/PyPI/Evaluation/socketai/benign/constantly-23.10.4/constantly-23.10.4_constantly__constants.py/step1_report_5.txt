{
  "purpose": "The code defines a framework for creating symbolic constants, including named, value-based, and flag (bitmask) constants, with support for comparison, ordering, and bitwise operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes for constants, and methods such as lookupByName and iterconstants access internal dictionaries of constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this code; no untrusted data is written to files, network, or external systems.",
  "flows": "Constants are created and stored in class-level dictionaries; lookup functions retrieve constants by name or value, but no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of object comparison, ordering, and set operations appears standard. No obfuscated code, malicious network access, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of symbolic constants with support for different types (named, valued, flags). It uses class attributes and class-level dictionaries to manage constants, with methods for lookup and iteration. The structure aligns with common patterns for symbolic enums or constants. No code injection, external network access, or malicious behavior is detected. The code appears well-structured, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign constants framework intended for defining and managing symbolic constants, including support for ordered, named, and flag-based constants. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this code segment.",
