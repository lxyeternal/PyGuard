{
  "purpose": "The code provides a framework for defining, managing, and comparing symbolic constants, including named constants, value constants, and flag constants, mainly used for organizing symbolic constants with ordering and type safety.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes for constants definitions, class methods like lookupByName and lookupByValue for constant retrieval, and methods involving constant instantiation and realization.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly defined; no untrusted data is processed or executed in a way that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Constants are created and realized during class definition via metaclass processing; lookup methods access internal dictionaries; operator overloading methods combine constants or compare them.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The use of _constantOrder with count() is standard for ordering constants. No obfuscated or malicious-looking code structures are present. The only dynamic aspects are class-based constants, which are typical in such frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a sophisticated constants framework with ordered, comparable, and combinable constants using Python classes, metaclasses, and operator overloading. The design appears consistent with typical symbolic constant patterns. No external data is fetched or used insecurely, no code injection points are present, and no suspicious behavior such as network activity, file access, or environment variable misuse is evident. The structure relies on class attributes and internal data structures, typical for constant management. There are no signs of malware or malicious payloads embedded in the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of symbolic constant management, with no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It functions as intended for organizing constants within a larger system, with no harmful or malicious features detected.",
