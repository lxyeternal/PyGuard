{
  "purpose": "The code defines a framework for creating and managing symbolic constants, including named constants, value-based constants, and flag-based bitmask constants, mainly for use as symbolic or enumerated values in larger systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources; it only defines classes and methods for creating constants and looking them up by name or value.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions such as network communication, file modification, or system calls.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely class and data structure definitions with internal logic for managing constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors, are present. The code is a standard implementation of symbolic constants with ordering and bitwise operations.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a structured approach to defining constants with support for ordering, comparison, and bitwise flag operations. It uses standard Python features like metaclasses and class attributes to manage collections of constants. No external data input, network activity, or code injection points are present. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are detected. The functions are straightforward, and all operations are related to defining and manipulating constants. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or system compromise behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, well-structured constants management framework with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not interact with external systems or sensitive data, nor does it include any suspicious operations. The code appears to be a standard implementation of constants management used in larger systems.",
