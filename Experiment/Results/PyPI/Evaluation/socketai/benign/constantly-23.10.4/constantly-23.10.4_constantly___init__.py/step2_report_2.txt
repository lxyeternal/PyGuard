  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Behavior & Logic Confirmation:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is primarily importing constants and retrieving version info via `get_versions()`.\n   - No untrusted input, output, or data processing is involved.\n   - The code structure is straightforward, typical for package setup files.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic:**\n   - No logical errors or mistakes are evident.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is standard package metadata code.\n\n3. **Scores Review & Justification:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious patterns, these scores seem appropriate.\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, indicating certainty.\n\n4. **Risk & Malware Score Justification:**\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain any suspicious or obfuscated code.\n   - The only dynamic element is fetching version info via `get_versions()`, which is standard.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are consistent with the code; no assumptions are made about malicious intent.\n   - The reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n6. **Score Consistency & Final Estimation:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - Given the comprehensive analysis, I concur with the assigned scores.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n- The code is a standard, benign module for package metadata.\n- No malicious or obfuscated behavior detected.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code poses no security risks, malware concerns, or obfuscation issues. It is a typical setup module for package metadata with no vulnerabilities.",
