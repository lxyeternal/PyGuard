{
  "purpose": "To define module metadata and import constants from a submodule for use in the package.",
  "sources": "Importing from 'constantly._constants' and '_version' module, retrieving version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; no data outputs or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Import statements and version retrieval flow from submodules to module namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The version string is retrieved dynamically, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants from a submodule, retrieves version info dynamically, and defines metadata variables. All operations are straightforward and typical for package initialization. No malicious or suspicious code patterns identified, no network activity or data leaks. The code appears to be purely for module setup and metadata definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs imports and sets metadata variables safely.",
