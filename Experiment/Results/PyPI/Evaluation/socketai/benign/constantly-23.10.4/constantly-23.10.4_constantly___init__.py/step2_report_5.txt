  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is straightforward, involving importing constants, retrieving version info, and setting metadata variables. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code is standard for package setup and metadata management.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the only dynamic aspect is the version retrieval via `_version.get_versions()`, which is typical and does not pose security risks. No logical flaws are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - malware: 0\n   - securityRisk: 0\n   - obfuscated: 0  \n   These are appropriate given the code's nature. The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious operations.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely for package metadata and constants, with no untrusted input, no external data processing, and no network activity, there is no justification for higher risk scores. The assessments are justified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. There is no malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious code.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports are cautious and based on the code's actual content, not assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical package metadata module with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — standard package setup code with no security issues.\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe code is safe, and the reports are accurate. No further action needed.",
