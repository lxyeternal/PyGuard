{
  "purpose": "The code initializes constants and retrieves version information for the package, primarily for configuration and metadata purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'constantly._constants' and local '_version' module; retrieves version info via '_version.get_versions()'.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data processing or external data output present.",
  "flows": "Version information retrieved from '_version.get_versions()', which is used to set '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the only dynamic element is fetching version info, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports predefined constants from a package and sets package metadata variables. It dynamically retrieves the version number via a function call to '_version.get_versions()'. The version info is used solely for package identification. No input/output streams or untrusted data handling are present. The code appears to be standard package setup code with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package metadata setup with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It correctly retrieves and sets version information for the package.",
