{
  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata and imports constants for use within the package, with a dynamic version retrieval via an internal module.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the imported constants and calls _version.get_versions() to obtain version info.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the import statements and the version function call to the setting of module-level variables; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setting package metadata, importing constants, and retrieving version info via a function call. It involves no user input, network activity, or data processing. The version retrieval is standard and internal. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package metadata module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no further scrutiny is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
