{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and retrieves version information for the package, likely used for configuration and metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'constantly._constants' module, and calls 'get_versions()' from '_version' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "Imports constants; retrieves version info via a function call; no flow from untrusted input to output.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward, with no suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific constants, sets version and author metadata, and defines an export list. The only dynamic aspect is fetching the version via 'get_versions()'. This is standard practice for package metadata and does not involve untrusted input or malicious behavior. No anomalies or malicious patterns are evident. The structure is clear, with no obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package metadata module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines constants and retrieves version information, which is standard practice.",
