{
  "purpose": "To define constants and version information for the Twisted Matrix Laboratories package.",
  "sources": "Importing constant definitions from 'constantly._constants' and obtaining version info from '_version.get_versions()'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that handle untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Version data obtained from '_version.get_versions()' flows into the '__version__' variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors are present. The code mainly imports modules, assigns variables, and formats strings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constant definitions from a likely internal module, retrieves version info via a function call, and assigns author, license, and copyright details. The version retrieval is straightforward and does not involve any external input or network operations. All imported modules appear to be part of the package's internal structure. There are no suspicious operations, hidden code, or obfuscated segments. The overall structure is typical for a package's metadata file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard package metadata and constant definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs straightforward imports and variable assignments without processing untrusted data or executing dangerous operations.",
