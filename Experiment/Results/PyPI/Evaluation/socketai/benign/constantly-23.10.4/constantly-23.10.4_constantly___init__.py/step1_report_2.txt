{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and export constants and version information for a Python package, likely part of a larger library.",
  "sources": "Imports from constantly._constants module and a call to _version.get_versions()",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing, output, or untrusted data handling occurs",
  "flows": "Import statements lead to the assignment of __version__, which is derived from _version.get_versions()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The version retrieval relies on an external module, but this is typical for versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants and version info, sets author and license metadata, and defines exportable symbols. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. The version info retrieval depends on an external module, but without more details, it appears standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module metadata and constants definition file with no apparent malicious intent or security issues.",
