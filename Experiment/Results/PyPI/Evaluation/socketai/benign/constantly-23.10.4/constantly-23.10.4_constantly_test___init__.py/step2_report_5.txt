  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code snippet and the details within each report.\n\n**Summary of the code snippet:**\n- Contains only comments, license notices, and a docstring indicating tests for a module named \"Constantly.\"\n- No executable code, functions, data flows, or external interactions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Comments indicating tests for \"Constantly.\"\n- **Analysis:** Only comments and license info; no code or suspicious activity.\n- **Risk assessment:** No malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- **Score justification:** The score of 0 for malware and security risk is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the absence of code and malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, matching the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Again, only comments and license info.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, consistent with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Same reasoning; no executable code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** All zeros.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Same conclusion; benign comments and license notices.\n- **Scores:** All zeros.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- **Code presence:** None; only comments and documentation.\n- **Malware risk:** None; no executable code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; straightforward comments.\n- **Security risk:** None; no data flows, no network activity, no code execution.\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- The scores assigned in all reports are consistent with the actual content.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score should be 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- The risk score should be 0, given the absence of any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the assessments are appropriate given the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Since the code is purely comments and license info, there is no need to adjust scores or suspect hidden malicious intent. The overall security posture is benign.",
