  "purpose": "Commented header indicating the file contains tests for a component called 'Constantly'.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potential leak points present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow since the code contains only comments and license notices.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code structure; no suspicious or unusual code patterns. The comments and license info are standard.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of license comments and a docstring indicating it is a test file for 'Constantly'. There is no executable code, no data input, no processing, and no network communication or side effects. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The absence of code reduces the risk profile significantly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard header and comment block with no executable logic, data flows, or suspicious constructs. It poses no security risks or malware concerns. The code appears benign and is likely part of a test suite.",
