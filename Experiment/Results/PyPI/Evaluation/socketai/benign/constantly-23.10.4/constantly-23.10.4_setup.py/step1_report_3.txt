  "purpose": "Set up the package using versioneer for version management and distribution.",
  "sources": "Importing versioneer module, calling versioneer.get_version() and versioneer.get_cmdclass()",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external output involved",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; setup parameters are derived from versioneer functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with versioneer integration, no suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports versioneer for dynamic version management, a common practice in Python packaging. It calls get_version() and get_cmdclass() methods, which are standard functions provided by versioneer. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or unusual behaviors. The script's purpose is straightforward to facilitate versioning and setup, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package using versioneer. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
