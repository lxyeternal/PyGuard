  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for a Python package using versioneer for version management.",
  "sources": "Import statements for versioneer and setuptools, call to setup() with version and cmdclass from versioneer.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static code with no external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard setup code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package setup script that imports versioneer and setuptools, then calls setup() with version info. It contains no user input, environment variables, or external data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is widely used in open-source projects for version management. All signals indicate benign, standard code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
