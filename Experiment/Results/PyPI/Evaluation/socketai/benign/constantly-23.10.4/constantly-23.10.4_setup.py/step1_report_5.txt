  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package using versioneer for version management.",
  "sources": "Imports versioneer module, retrieves version and command classes for setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup parameters are standard.",
  "flows": "Imports versioneer → calls get_version() and get_cmdclass() → passes to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the versioneer module, which is used to manage versioning dynamically. It then calls versioneer.get_version() and versioneer.get_cmdclass() to integrate version information into the setup process. The code is minimal and standard for a Python package setup script that uses versioneer. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script leveraging versioneer for version management. No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
