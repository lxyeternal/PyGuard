  "anomalies": "Use of versioneer, a common version management tool; no suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code imports versioneer to handle versioning and sets up the package with setuptools. No user input, environment variables, or external data is processed. The code structure is straightforward, following standard package setup patterns. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues. The use of versioneer is typical in open-source projects for automated version management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package using versioneer. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and typical for open-source projects.",
