  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, using versioneer to manage versioning.",
  "sources": "Import statements: versioneer module, setup function from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or external data leakage.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script primarily calls functions to set up package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of versioneer is standard for version management; no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports versioneer and setuptools, then calls setup with version information obtained via versioneer. It is a minimal setup configuration, typical for open-source Python packages. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No obfuscation, unnecessary dynamic code, or unusual constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package that uses versioneer for version management. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
