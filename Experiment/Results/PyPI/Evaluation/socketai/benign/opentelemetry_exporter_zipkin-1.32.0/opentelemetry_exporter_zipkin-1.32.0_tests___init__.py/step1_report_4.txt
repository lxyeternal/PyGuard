  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but no explicit purpose is clear due to lack of context and absence of comments or documentation.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from environment variables, imported modules, and possibly from function parameters or input prompts.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file writes, or printing outputs, though explicit code for such actions is not visible in the provided fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables and inputs through functions and into processing routines, but specific flow paths are unclear without more code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function names, or obfuscated code are evident. The code does not contain obvious malicious behavior or anomalies based on the provided fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment provided is minimal and does not show any malicious activity or security issues. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code uses standard library modules and functions without suspicious patterns. Without additional context or more code, no anomalies or malicious behaviors can be confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no signs of malware or security risks. The code appears benign, with no malicious intent detected in the fragment provided.",
