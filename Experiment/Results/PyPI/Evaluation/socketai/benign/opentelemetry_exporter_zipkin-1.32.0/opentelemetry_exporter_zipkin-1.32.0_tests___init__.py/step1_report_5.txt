  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform a specific task which is not explicitly described in the provided snippet. It may be part of a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from environment variables, function parameters, or external libraries, but specific sources are not clearly identifiable without more context.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, file operations, or execution of dynamically generated code, but no explicit sinks are detected in the snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through internal processing, but no clear source-to-sink flow can be established based solely on the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are evident in the given code segment. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code has been reviewed thoroughly, including the beginning, middle, and end sections. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads, are observed. Usage of third-party libraries is not inherently suspicious and no malicious code injections are detected. The code does not perform any insecure operations like unsafe SQL, code injection, or unsafe environment variable usage. There are no indicators of obfuscation or malicious intent within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code appears benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to serve a legitimate purpose without introducing vulnerabilities or malware.",
