      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no malicious activity; Report 3's obfuscation and suspicion justify moderate concern. The current scores are appropriate, with a slight recommendation to lower the malware score in Report 3 from 0.4 to around 0.3 for increased accuracy. Overall, the security assessment indicates low to moderate risk, primarily driven by obfuscation and dynamic code patterns in one report."
