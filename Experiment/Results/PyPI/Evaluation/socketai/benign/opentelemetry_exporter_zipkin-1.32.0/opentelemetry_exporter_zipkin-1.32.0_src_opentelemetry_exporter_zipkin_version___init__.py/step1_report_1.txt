  "anomalies": "Presence of licensing comments, but no suspicious or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a single version assignment statement. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no use of sensitive information. The license comments are standard boilerplate. The __version__ variable is assigned a static string value. No malicious or suspicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign code snippet setting a version variable with licensing comments. It contains no malicious code or security risks.",
