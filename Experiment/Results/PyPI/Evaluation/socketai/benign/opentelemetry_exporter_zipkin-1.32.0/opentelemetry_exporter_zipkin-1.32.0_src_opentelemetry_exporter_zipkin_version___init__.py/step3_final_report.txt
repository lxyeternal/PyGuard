  "purpose": "The code serves as a license header and defines a static version string for the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it contains only comments and a static assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted sinks or data flows; the code does not process or output any data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code is static and contains only comments and a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard open-source license header with a version variable. It contains only comments and a static string assignment, with no dynamic code, data input/output, or external dependencies. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. The confidence level is high (1), given the straightforward and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign license header with a version declaration, posing no security risks or malicious intent. All reports and scores are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
