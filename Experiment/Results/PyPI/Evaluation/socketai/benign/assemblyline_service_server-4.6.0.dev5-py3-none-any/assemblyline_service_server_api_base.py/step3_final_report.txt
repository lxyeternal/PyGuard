  "purpose": "Provides API version listing and authentication via environment variables, with monitoring integration.",
  "sources": "Request headers ('HTTP_X_APIKEY', 'HTTP_CONTAINER_ID', etc.), environment variables (AUTH_KEY, config), Flask route rules.",
  "sinks": "Logging detailed request headers and environment variables on failed authentication, setting user context in Elastic APM.",
  "flows": "Request headers/env -> API key validation -> Logging (if invalid) -> User context setting in APM -> Route inspection for version listing.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive logging of headers and environment variables on failed auth, which could leak sensitive info if logs are exposed. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Flask API setup with environment-based API key validation, detailed logging for failed attempts, and Elastic APM user context setting. No obfuscated or malicious code is present. The detailed logs could pose privacy risks but are typical for debugging. The API version listing inspects route rules dynamically, which is standard. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate given the code's behavior. The security concern is minor and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Flask API implementation with minor security considerations related to verbose logging. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
