      "conclusion": "The reports' scoring and reasoning are generally sound. To better reflect the potential severity, increase Report 1's malware score from 0.4 to 0.5 and Report 4's from 0.2 to 0.4. The overall assessment remains conservative but appropriate, emphasizing obfuscation and dynamic execution as key risk indicators requiring further review."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard server configuration snippet with no malicious or suspicious elements. The environment variable usage is typical and safe in the code context. The security risk is minimal and related to deployment practices rather than code flaws. Scores should reflect no malware or obfuscation, with a very low security risk (~0.1-0.2) due to TLS configuration considerations."

Obfuscation and complexity in some reports warrant vigilance, but current scores accurately reflect the low threat level. Minor adjustments to malware scoring in report 3 can improve consistency, but overall, the security posture remains low risk with no active malware detected."
