  "purpose": "This code provides an API endpoint for generating API documentation by introspecting Flask application's registered routes, functions, and blueprints.",
  "sources": "current_app.url_map.iter_rules(), current_app.view_functions, request.path, rule.endpoint, func.__doc__",
  "sinks": "Access to current_app.blueprints, reading function __doc__, constructing API response object",
  "flows": "Reads route rules and function docs (source) and constructs API documentation (sink) based on route rules and function metadata",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious function calls, no suspicious data leaks or network operations",
  "analysis": "The code performs route inspection within Flask, extracting route rules, allowed methods, associated functions, and documentation strings. It constructs a list of API definitions for documentation purposes. The process involves reading internal Flask app data structures, which are standard for dynamic API documentation. No user input is processed directly or used insecurely. No external network access, data leakage, or malicious activity is evident. The code appears straightforward and adheres to common Flask patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Flask API documentation generator, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It solely inspects existing route definitions and function docstrings to produce documentation, without performing any suspicious actions.",
