  "purpose": "Generate API documentation by introspecting Flask's registered routes, functions, and blueprints to produce a structured JSON overview.",
  "sources": "current_app.url_map.iter_rules(), current_app.view_functions, request.path",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads internal Flask app data and constructs a response",
  "flows": "Reads route rules and function docstrings, constructs API list and blueprint info, returns response",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling; filtering routes based on request.path which may be overly restrictive but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Flask introspection to generate API documentation without executing external code or network operations. It reads internal app structures safely, handles missing data gracefully, and constructs a JSON response. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical Flask documentation endpoints.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Flask API documentation generator with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
