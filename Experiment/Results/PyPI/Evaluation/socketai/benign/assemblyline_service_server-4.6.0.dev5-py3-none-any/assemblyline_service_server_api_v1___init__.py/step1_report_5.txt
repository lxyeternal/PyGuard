  "purpose": "Defines an API endpoint for retrieving documentation of registered API routes in a Flask application.",
  "sources": "current_app.url_map.iter_rules(), request.path, current_app.view_functions, rule.endpoint, rule.methods",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code primarily reads data and generates a response. No untrusted data is used in sensitive operations or system commands.",
  "flows": "The code reads route rules and function docstrings, processes them, and returns a structured JSON response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or data leaks present.",
  "analysis": "The code accesses Flask application routing rules and view functions to generate documentation data. It filters routes based on the request path, extracts function docstrings, and constructs a JSON response. Error handling is minimal but appropriate for documentation generation. There are no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or security compromises. The code is structured for legitimate documentation purposes, with no external calls, network activity, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API documentation generator within a Flask app. It performs safe, read-only operations on Flask internals with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
