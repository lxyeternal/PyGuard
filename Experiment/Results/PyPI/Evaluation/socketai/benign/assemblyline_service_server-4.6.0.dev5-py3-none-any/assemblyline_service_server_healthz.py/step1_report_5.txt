  "purpose": "Provide health check endpoints for liveness and readiness of a web service",
  "sources": "HTTP request handlers for /healthz/live and /healthz/ready endpoints",
  "sinks": "make_response() and abort() functions which generate HTTP responses based on internal state",
  "flows": "Requests to /live invoke liveness(), requests to /ready invoke readyness(), which may trigger abort(503)",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic observed; use of standard Flask health check pattern",
  "analysis": "The code defines two health check endpoints: one for liveness (/live) always returning 'OK', and one for readiness (/ready) which checks the ping() method on STORAGE.ds. The error handler returns 'FAIL' on 503 errors. The implementation uses standard Flask functions with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or suspicious behavior. The storage ping check might be a point of failure, but it appears intended for health monitoring, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides straightforward health check endpoints without any signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to be standard monitoring code, with no suspicious anomalies or malicious patterns.",
