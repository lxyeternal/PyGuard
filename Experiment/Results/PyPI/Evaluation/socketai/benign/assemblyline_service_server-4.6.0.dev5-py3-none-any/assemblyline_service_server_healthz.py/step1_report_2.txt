{
  "purpose": "This code implements health check endpoints for a Flask application, providing liveness and readiness status.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from 'assemblyline_service_server.config', specifically 'STORAGE'.",
  "sinks": "Returns simple string responses ('OK' or 'FAIL') and an HTTP 503 status code via Flask's make_response and abort functions.",
  "flows": "Health check functions invoke 'STORAGE.ds.ping()' to determine readiness; responses are based on this check.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or malicious code, no external network connections, no obfuscated code, and no unusual data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two health check endpoints '/live' and '/ready'. The '/ready' endpoint calls 'STORAGE.ds.ping()' to verify system health. The error handler for 503 returns a 'FAIL' message. The code relies on external configuration and data source 'STORAGE', but nothing indicates malicious intent. There are no suspicious code patterns, no data leaks, and no signs of malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of health check endpoints with no malicious behavior or security risks. It safely verifies system liveness and readiness based on the status of 'STORAGE'.",
