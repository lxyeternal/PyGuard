{
  "purpose": "Implement health check endpoints (/live and /ready) for service liveness and readiness verification.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the Flask request context and the STORAGE configuration object.",
  "sinks": "The code returns HTTP responses; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input from HTTP requests triggers endpoint functions, which respond based on STORAGE.ds.ping() status.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward health check implementation with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard health endpoints: /live always returns 'OK'; /ready checks STORAGE.ds.ping() to determine readiness. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The reliance on STORAGE.ds.ping() is typical for health checks. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign health check implementation with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.",
