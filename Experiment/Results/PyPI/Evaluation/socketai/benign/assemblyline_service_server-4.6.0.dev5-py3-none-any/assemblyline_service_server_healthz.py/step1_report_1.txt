  "purpose": "Provide health check endpoints for liveness and readiness status of a Flask-based service",
  "sources": "import statements, STORAGE.ds.ping() call",
  "sinks": "make_response, abort, errorhandler",
  "flows": "HTTP request to /healthz/live triggers liveness response; request to /healthz/ready triggers STORAGE.ds.ping() check, potentially leading to abort with 503",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed; no hidden backdoors or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple health check endpoints for a Flask application. The liveness check always returns 'OK'. The readiness check calls STORAGE.ds.ping() to determine if the service is ready; if ping fails, it aborts with a 503. The error handler returns 'FAIL' on 503 errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscation. Usage of the STORAGE object could be a point to verify, but it appears to be a configuration/state check rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements straightforward health check endpoints with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on STORAGE.ds.ping() for readiness status, which is standard for health endpoints. No malicious behavior detected.",
