{
  "purpose": "This code provides health check endpoints for a Flask-based web service, specifically for liveness and readiness probes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the STORAGE.ds.ping() function to determine service readiness.",
  "sinks": "The code returns static responses or aborts with an HTTP 503 status code; it does not write to external systems or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The liveness endpoint returns 'OK' unconditionally; the readiness endpoint calls STORAGE.ds.ping() and returns 'OK' if true or aborts with 503 if false.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or unusual data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward health check implementation using Flask. It imports configuration and defines two routes for health monitoring. The 'ping' method on STORAGE.ds appears to be a standard health check call; no evidence of malicious behavior or data leakage. Error handling is standard, with 503 response for service unavailability. No hidden or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements basic health check endpoints without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard pattern for service health monitoring and does not contain malicious behaviors.",
