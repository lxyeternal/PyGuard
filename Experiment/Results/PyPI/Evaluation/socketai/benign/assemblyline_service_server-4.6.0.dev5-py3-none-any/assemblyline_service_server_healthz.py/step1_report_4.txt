{
  "purpose": "Provides health check endpoints for liveness and readiness status of a web service",
  "sources": "Reads request routes and configuration from Flask Blueprint; checks the STORAGE.ds.ping() method for health status",
  "sinks": "Returns 'OK' or triggers abort(503); no direct sink of untrusted data or sensitive information",
  "flows": "Request hits /live route, returns static 'OK'; request hits /ready route, calls STORAGE.ds.ping(), returns 'OK' or aborts 503",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors; straightforward health check implementation",
  "analysis": "The code defines health check endpoints using Flask Blueprint. The /live route always returns 'OK', indicating the service is alive. The /ready route calls STORAGE.ds.ping() to determine readiness; if ping is successful, returns 'OK', otherwise aborts with 503. No data leaks, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious inputs or outputs. Uses standard Flask response mechanisms. No external data or environment variables are used in an insecure manner. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard health check endpoints with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected functionality for service health monitoring.",
