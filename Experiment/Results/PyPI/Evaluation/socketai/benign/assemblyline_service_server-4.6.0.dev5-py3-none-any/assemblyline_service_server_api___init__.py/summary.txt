  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed show no definitive malicious activity. Obfuscation and complexity in some reports warrant vigilance, but current scores accurately reflect the low threat level. Minor adjustments to malware scoring in report 3 can improve consistency, but overall, the security posture remains low risk with no active malware detected."
