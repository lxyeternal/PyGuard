  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module or script intended for general functionality, but without specific context, its purpose cannot be precisely determined.",
  "sources": "Input is read from environment variables, user input via function parameters or standard input, and potentially from external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to the console (stdout), files, or possibly sent over network connections; environment variables may be accessed or modified.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from environment variables or user input could flow into output functions, file writes, or network communication if such functions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious obfuscation, or unusual behavior such as dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or suspicious imports are evident. The code structure appears straightforward with no clear malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed from start to finish, checking for common security issues. No suspicious imports, code injections, or data exfiltration mechanisms were observed. No hardcoded secrets or unusual control flows are present. The code uses standard libraries and patterns, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no malicious or suspicious activities detected. Confidence is high due to the straightforward nature of the code.",
