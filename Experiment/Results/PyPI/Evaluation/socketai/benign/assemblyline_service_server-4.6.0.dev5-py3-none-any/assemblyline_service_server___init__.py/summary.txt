  "conclusion": "The reports' scoring and reasoning are generally sound. To better reflect the potential severity, increase Report 1's malware score from 0.4 to 0.5 and Report 4's from 0.2 to 0.4. The overall assessment remains conservative but appropriate, emphasizing obfuscation and dynamic execution as key risk indicators requiring further review."
