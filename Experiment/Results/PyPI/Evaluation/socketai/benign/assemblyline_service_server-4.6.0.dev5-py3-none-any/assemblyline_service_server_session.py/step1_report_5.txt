{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for tracking service worker status and session data within a system.",
  "sources": "Imports from datetime, typing, and assemblyline modules; class attributes that store session IDs, IPs, service names, and statuses.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data leading to vulnerabilities; code primarily defines data structures and constants.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources like client IDs, IPs, and statuses into structured models; no dynamic data processing or external interactions observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The use of enums, optional fields, and data annotations appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a set of statuses, and creates two data models: Current and ServiceClient. The models specify fields for statuses, tasks, client IDs, IPs, service info, and metrics. The default status is 'INITIALIZING', and optional fields are appropriately used. No code execution, external network calls, or obfuscation is present. The models serve as data schemas for internal system state tracking. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward data model definitions for system status and session management. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies identified. It is a standard implementation without suspicious intent.",
