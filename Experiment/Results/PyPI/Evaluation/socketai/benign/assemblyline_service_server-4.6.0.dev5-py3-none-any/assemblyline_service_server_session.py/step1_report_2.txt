  "purpose": "Define data models for service worker status and session data using odm (Object Data Model) schema",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources are explicitly read within this code",
  "sinks": "No direct data output, network, or untrusted sink operations are present",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only defines models",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward data modeling without any suspicious constructs; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and the assemblyline ODM library to define data schemas. It includes two models: 'Current' for tracking task status and 'ServiceClient' for session data. The models specify fields with types and optional attributes. No external inputs, user inputs, or network operations are present. No encryption, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is detected. The code is consistent with schema definitions and contains no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines data models for service worker status and session information. There are no indications of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks within this snippet.",
