  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a server, defining binding port, worker processes, threading, request limits, timeouts, and TLS/SSL files.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: PORT, WORKERS, THREADS, WORKER_CONNECTIONS, MAX_REQUESTS, MAX_REQUESTS_JITTER, GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT, TIMEOUT, CERTFILE, KEYFILE",
  "sinks": "Environment variable reads influence server configuration, including port, worker count, timeouts, and SSL file paths.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at startup to set server parameters; no direct data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks during runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for configuration is standard; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code behavior. No code injection or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports environment variables and uses them to set server parameters such as port, workers, threads, request limits, timeouts, and SSL certificate files. It employs default values for some parameters. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. Usage of environment variables is common for configurable server setups. No obfuscation, malware, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration snippet for a server, securely using environment variables for flexibility. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this fragment.",
