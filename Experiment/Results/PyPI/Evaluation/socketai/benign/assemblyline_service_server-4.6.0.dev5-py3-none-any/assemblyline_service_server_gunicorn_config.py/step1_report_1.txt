  "purpose": "Configure server settings using environment variables for port, workers, threads, connections, request recycling, timeouts, and TLS/SSL certificates.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ: PORT, WORKERS, THREADS, WORKER_CONNECTIONS, MAX_REQUESTS, MAX_REQUESTS_JITTER, GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT, TIMEOUT, CERTFILE, KEYFILE.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; environment variables are used to configure parameters, and file paths for SSL certificates are read.",
  "flows": "Environment variables provide configuration parameters, used directly to set server behavior and TLS files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for configuration is standard; no anomalies or suspicious code behavior identified.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves configuration parameters for a server setup from environment variables, assigning defaults where necessary. It includes parameters for network binding, worker and thread management, request handling limits, timeouts, and SSL configuration. No code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious logic is present. The use of environment variables for configuration is common and not suspicious. The SSL certificate paths are read but not validated or used insecurely. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage in this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard server configuration snippet using environment variables for flexibility. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior and is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
