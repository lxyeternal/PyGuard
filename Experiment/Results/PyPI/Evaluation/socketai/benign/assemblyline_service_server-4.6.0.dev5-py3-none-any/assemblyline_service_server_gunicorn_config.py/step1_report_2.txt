  "purpose": "Configuration for a server setup, defining binding address, worker processes, threads, connection limits, request limits, timeouts, and TLS/SSL certificates.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via env.get() for PORT, WORKERS, THREADS, WORKER_CONNECTIONS, MAX_REQUESTS, MAX_REQUESTS_JITTER, GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT, TIMEOUT, CERTFILE, KEYFILE.",
  "sinks": "Usage of environment variables that influence server behavior, TLS/SSL certificate files.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at startup; their values configure server parameters without further untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses environment variables in a standard manner to configure server settings. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration parameters from environment variables to set server binding address, worker count, threading, connection limits, request limits, timeouts, and TLS certificates. All environment variables are used for configuration without executing untrusted data or performing risky operations. The certificate and key files are specified via env variables but not used directly in this snippet, assuming they are used elsewhere in a safe manner. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. Usage appears to be standard for server configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup for a server, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on environment variables for configuration, which is standard practice. No anomalies, malicious activities, or security threats are detected.",
