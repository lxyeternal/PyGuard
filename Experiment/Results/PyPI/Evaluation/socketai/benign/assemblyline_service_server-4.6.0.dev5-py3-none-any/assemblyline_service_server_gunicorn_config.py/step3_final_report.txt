  "purpose": "Configure server parameters such as port, workers, threads, request limits, timeouts, and TLS certificate paths via environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed through os.environ for PORT, WORKERS, THREADS, WORKER_CONNECTIONS, MAX_REQUESTS, MAX_REQUESTS_JITTER, GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT, TIMEOUT, CERTFILE, KEYFILE.",
  "sinks": "None; environment variables are used for configuration only, without insecure data handling or external data flows.",
  "flows": "Environment variables provide configuration values used directly in server setup parameters; no untrusted data flows to insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for server configuration. Usage of environment variables for TLS files could pose deployment risks if misconfigured but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration parameters from environment variables with defaults, setting up server binding, worker/thread counts, request limits, timeouts, and TLS certificate paths. No suspicious or malicious logic, obfuscation, or code injection is present. The environment variables are used in a typical manner, and the code structure is clear. The only potential concern is TLS file paths specified via environment variables, which could be misconfigured or exposed if environment variables are compromised, but this is a deployment issue, not a code flaw.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard server configuration snippet with no malicious or suspicious elements. The environment variable usage is typical and safe in the code context. The security risk is minimal and related to deployment practices rather than code flaws. Scores should reflect no malware or obfuscation, with a very low security risk (~0.1-0.2) due to TLS configuration considerations.",
