  "purpose": "Configure server parameters using environment variables, including port binding, worker processes, threads, request limits, timeouts, and TLS/SSL settings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: 'PORT', 'WORKERS', 'THREADS', 'WORKER_CONNECTIONS', 'MAX_REQUESTS', 'MAX_REQUESTS_JITTER', 'GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT', 'TIMEOUT', 'CERTFILE', 'KEYFILE'.",
  "sinks": "Variables used for server configuration which could influence server behavior, but no direct data leaks or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and assigned to configuration variables; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for configuration is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns observed. The configuration parameters are typical for server setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports environment variable handling and multiprocessing modules, then reads various configuration parameters from environment variables, providing defaults where necessary. The port is dynamically set from 'PORT', worker count from 'WORKERS', and other server parameters are configured similarly. TLS/SSL certificate files are optionally loaded via environment variables. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or unusual behavior. All data handling appears to be standard configuration without any malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely handles server configuration through environment variables, with no evidence of malicious or maliciously manipulated code. It appears to be a standard setup script for a server application, with no malware or security risks detected.",
