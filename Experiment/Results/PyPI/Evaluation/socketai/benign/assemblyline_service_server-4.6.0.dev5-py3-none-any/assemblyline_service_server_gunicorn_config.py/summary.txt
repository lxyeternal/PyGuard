  "conclusion": "The code is a standard server configuration snippet with no malicious or suspicious elements. The environment variable usage is typical and safe in the code context. The security risk is minimal and related to deployment practices rather than code flaws. Scores should reflect no malware or obfuscation, with a very low security risk (~0.1-0.2) due to TLS configuration considerations."
