  "purpose": "Configure server settings such as port, workers, threads, connection limits, request handling, and TLS/SSL certificates using environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables using os.environ.get for PORT, WORKERS, THREADS, WORKER_CONNECTIONS, MAX_REQUESTS, MAX_REQUESTS_JITTER, GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT, TIMEOUT, CERTFILE, and KEYFILE.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of environment variables for server configuration, especially TLS/SSL certificate files which, if maliciously set, could lead to insecure configurations.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and directly used to set server parameters; no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations beyond configuration.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code straightforwardly reads environment variables for configuration without any unusual code constructs or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code loads configuration parameters from environment variables to set up server behavior. It defaults to sensible values for most parameters, with optional TLS/SSL certificate files specified by env variables. No malicious code or suspicious logic is present. Usage of environment variables for configuration is standard practice. There are no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. No obfuscated or suspicious code features are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration setup for a server, relying on environment variables for flexibility. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The only consideration is ensuring environment variables are properly secured in deployment, especially for TLS certificate files.",
