  "anomalies": [
    "Hardcoded default value for 'SERVICE_API_KEY' ('ThisIsARandomAuthKey...ChangeMe!') which is insecure and likely placeholder.",
    "Use of environment variables with a default value for sensitive data.",
    "No explicit validation or encryption of environment variables or credentials.",
    "Initialization of multiple external clients without credential validation or security checks."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code sets up a service environment, loading configuration, setting environment-dependent variables, and initializing clients for Redis, datastore, and task management. The presence of a default 'SERVICE_API_KEY' indicates a placeholder that should be replaced with a secure secret. No malicious code or backdoors are present. The code appears to follow standard service initialization patterns, but the hardcoded default key poses a security risk if not properly replaced in production. No obfuscated code or malware signals are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily performs standard setup tasks for a service, with a notable security concern being the default API key, which should be secured before deployment. No malicious or backdooring behavior is evident.",
