  "purpose": "Initialize configuration, logging, and service clients for the Assemblyline service, setting environment variables and default secrets.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'ASSEMBLYLINE_VERSION' and 'SERVICE_API_KEY'; imported modules; configuration objects.",
  "sinks": "None directly; environment variables are read, but no untrusted data is used in a vulnerable manner.",
  "flows": "Environment variables set configuration parameters; default API key used in AUTH_KEY; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded default API key ('ThisIsARandomAuthKey...ChangeMe!') which is insecure if not replaced.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup: importing modules, configuring Redis clients, setting version and API key from environment variables with defaults, initializing logging, and creating service clients. The only security concern is the default API key, which is a placeholder and should be replaced in production. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2-0.3) are consistent with the code's straightforward nature and the security misconfiguration. The high confidence score (around 0.9) reflects certainty that there is no malware or obfuscation, only a security best practice issue.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard initialization code with no malicious intent or activity. The only security concern is the default placeholder API key, which should be replaced before deployment. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
