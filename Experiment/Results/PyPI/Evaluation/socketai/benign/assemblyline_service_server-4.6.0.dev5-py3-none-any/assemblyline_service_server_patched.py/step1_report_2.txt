  "purpose": "The code patches standard Python libraries for asynchronous I/O using gevent and then imports an application instance from assemblyline_service_server.app.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the gevent.monkey module and the assemblyline_service_server.app module.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this snippet; no untrusted data is processed or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "The code patches standard libraries asynchronously, then imports an application object; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. Usage of gevent.monkey.patch_all is common for asynchronous patching.",
  "analysis": "The code performs monkey patching for asynchronous I/O with gevent, which is a standard operation in Python applications needing concurrency. It then imports an application instance. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. No input or data processing occurs here. No external network interactions or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward setup for a Python web service, utilizing gevent for concurrency and importing an app object. There is no malicious behavior or security concern based on this snippet.",
