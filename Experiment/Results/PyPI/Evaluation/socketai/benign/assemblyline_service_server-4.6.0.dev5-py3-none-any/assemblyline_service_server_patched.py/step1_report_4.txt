  "purpose": "The code patches the standard library for asynchronous operation using gevent and imports a web application instance.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'from gevent.monkey import patch_all' and 'from assemblyline_service_server.app import app'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "The code patches the environment for asynchronous behavior, then loads a web app object; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The use of 'patch_all()' is common for gevent-based apps.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment patching for asynchronous IO via gevent, then imports a web app. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are present. The code is minimal and standard for gevent-based web services.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard setup code for a gevent-based application, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
