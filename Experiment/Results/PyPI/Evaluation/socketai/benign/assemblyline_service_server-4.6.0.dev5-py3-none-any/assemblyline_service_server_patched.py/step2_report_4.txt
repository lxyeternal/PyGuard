  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: importing `patch_all` from `gevent.monkey` and `app` from `assemblyline_service_server.app`.\n- The code is minimal, performing environment patching for asynchronous I/O and importing an application object.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources, no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The `patch_all()` function is standard in gevent-based applications, though it can obscure behavior if misused, but in this context, it appears legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, the code is straightforward and does not contain vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code is standard setup code. The reports correctly identify that no malicious activity or anomalies are present.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **`malware` score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. There is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n- **`securityRisk` score:**  \n  Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 in the reports, which seems slightly high given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities. Since `patch_all()` modifies standard library behavior, it can introduce risks if misused, but in this context, it's a common pattern. A more conservative score would be around 0.0 or 0.1, unless there's contextual concern.\n\n- **`obfuscated` score:**  \n  Correctly 0, as the code is clear.\n\n- **`confidence`:**  \n  High (1) in most reports, which is justified given the code's simplicity and clarity.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign such high scores, which is appropriate. The minimal code and lack of suspicious activity justify low risk scores.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- The reports correctly assume that `patch_all()` and importing `app` are benign, which aligns with standard practices.\n\n### Consistency:\n- Scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** Given the context, I would assign a **risk score of 0.1** to reflect that monkey patching can sometimes be risky if misused, but in this case, it's standard and not inherently dangerous.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The code snippet is benign and typical for gevent-based applications.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet alone.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the context provided.",
