{
  "purpose": "The code patches all gevent modules for asynchronous I/O and then imports an application instance from assemblyline_service_server.app.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import of 'patch_all' from 'gevent.monkey' and the import of 'app' from 'assemblyline_service_server.app'.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks; the code simply performs patching and imports a module.",
  "flows": "The code applies monkey patching which modifies standard library behaviors (source) and then imports an application object (sink). No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. 'patch_all()' is a common gevent function to enable asynchronous behavior, and the imports appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code applies gevent monkey patching to enable cooperative multitasking, which is a common pattern in asynchronous Python applications. It then imports an application instance from a module. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code is minimal, standard, and does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard initialization for a gevent-based Python service and imports an application object. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
