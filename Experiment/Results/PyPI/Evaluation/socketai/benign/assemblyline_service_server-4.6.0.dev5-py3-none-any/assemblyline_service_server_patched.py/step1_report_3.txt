  "purpose": "To patch standard Python libraries for cooperative multitasking and to initialize the assemblyline service server application.",
  "sources": "Import statement from gevent.monkey, which patches standard library modules.",
  "sinks": "Import statement from assemblyline_service_server.app, which loads the app module.",
  "flows": "The patch_all() function potentially modifies standard library functions; the app import loads application code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of gevent.monkey.patch_all() can sometimes obscure behavior, but is common in asynchronous applications. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code applies gevent's monkey patching to enable asynchronous IO, which is typical in networked services. The import of the app object suggests starting a web server or service. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is minimal, focusing on setting up the environment and importing the application.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard setup code for a gevent-based asynchronous service. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security concerns are evident from this snippet.",
