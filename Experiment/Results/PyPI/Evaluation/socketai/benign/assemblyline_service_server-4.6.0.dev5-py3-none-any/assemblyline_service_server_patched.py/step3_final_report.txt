  "purpose": "Set up gevent monkey patching for asynchronous I/O and import the web application instance.",
  "sources": "Importing 'patch_all' from 'gevent.monkey' and 'app' from 'assemblyline_service_server.app'.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Monkey patching affects standard library modules; importing 'app' initializes the web app.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'patch_all()' can obscure behavior but is standard in gevent setups; no suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs minimal setup for a gevent-based web service, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of 'patch_all()' is common but can sometimes be misused; however, in this context, it appears legitimate. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign low risk scores. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the obfuscation score is zero due to clear code. The risk score is slightly above zero (0.1) to reflect potential concerns with monkey patching, but given the context, this is justified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard initialization for a gevent-based Python web service, with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
