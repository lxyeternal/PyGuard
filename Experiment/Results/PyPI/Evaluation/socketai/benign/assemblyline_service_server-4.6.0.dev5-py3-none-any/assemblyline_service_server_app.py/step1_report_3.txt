  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive info in code",
    "SSL context is conditionally set based on file existence, which could be misused if files are improperly managed",
    "Secret key is from configuration, potentially external",
    "No suspicious or malicious code behavior observed",
    "No network communications or data exfiltration evident"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Flask service with logging, security, and monitoring features. SSL setup depends on the presence of certificate files, which is standard. Secret keys and APM URLs are sourced from configuration, not hardcoded. The app registers several API blueprints, indicating typical microservice setup. No suspicious behavior, data leaks, backdoors, or malicious activities are present. The code appears well-structured for secure operation, assuming external configurations are managed securely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Flask server setup with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It uses external configurations and environment variables properly, with SSL setup contingent on file presence. No signs of sabotage or malware are detected.",
