  "purpose": "This code sets up a Flask-based web service server with integrated logging, security configuration, and application performance monitoring (APM) integration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (SERVICE_SERVER_CLIENT_CERT_PATH, SERVICE_SERVER_CLIENT_KEY_PATH, config variables), imported modules, Flask app configuration",
  "sinks": "Flask app run method (listening on all interfaces), logging handlers, APM client initialization",
  "flows": "Environment variables and config data → SSL context setup; imported modules and config → Flask app setup → app.run",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials; SSL context setup based on file existence; standard import and registration of API blueprints; no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code initializes environment-based SSL certificates, sets up logging and Flask app with registered blueprints, and conditionally enables APM metrics. No hardcoded secrets are evident beyond environment variable defaults, which are standard. The SSL context is conditionally configured based on file existence, a typical pattern for secure communication. No suspicious or malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network connections, is detected. The code appears to be a legitimate server setup script without malicious intent or malware-like behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Flask server setup with environment-configured SSL, logging, and APM integration. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malware. It appears safe and legitimate.",
