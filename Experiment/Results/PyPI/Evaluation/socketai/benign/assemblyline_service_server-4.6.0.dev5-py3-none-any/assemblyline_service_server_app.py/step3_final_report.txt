  "purpose": "This code initializes a Flask-based service server with environment-configurable SSL, logging, API blueprints, and optional APM monitoring.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for SSL certificate paths, file existence checks for SSL setup, configuration objects for secret keys and APM URL, and API blueprint registrations.",
  "sinks": "The app.run() method exposing the server on all interfaces; logging handlers for debugging and monitoring; environment variables used for SSL configuration.",
  "flows": "Configuration and environment variables determine SSL context; blueprints register API endpoints; app.run() starts the server with SSL if configured.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard SSL setup based on file existence; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Flask server setup with environment-based SSL configuration, logging, API registration, and optional APM integration. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code. The SSL context is conditionally established based on the presence of certificate files, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The server exposes itself on all interfaces, which is operationally common but should be secured in deployment. The overall security risk is low, and the malware and obfuscated scores are justified at zero. The risk score is slightly elevated due to server exposure but remains low. The code is legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Flask server setup with environment-based SSL, logging, and monitoring. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
