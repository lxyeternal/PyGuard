  "purpose": "Set up and run a Flask-based service server with security configurations, logging, API blueprints, and application performance monitoring.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for SSL certificate paths, configuration files, and APM server URL",
  "sinks": "SSL context setup, logging output, APM client connection",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> SSL context; Configuration -> APM setup; Logging configuration -> logger handlers; Application startup -> app.run() with SSL context",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets; standard use of environment variables, logging, and Flask setup; no obfuscated or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Flask app with secure SSL configuration based on environment variables, sets up logging, and integrates Elastic APM for monitoring. The SSL certificate paths are configurable via environment variables, defaulting to specific paths. The code properly checks for file existence before enabling SSL. Logging is configured to remove default handlers and use parent handlers, avoiding unnecessary or suspicious logging behavior. The APM client is only instantiated if the server URL is provided, which is a normal conditional setup. The app is configured to run with host '0.0.0.0' on port 5003 with optional debug mode. No external data flows or untrusted inputs are used in a way that indicates malicious intent, nor are there signs of malicious code or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Flask service server setup with proper security and monitoring configurations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or backdoors. The implementation follows best practices for environment-based configuration and logging. Overall, it is a safe, intended application startup script.",
