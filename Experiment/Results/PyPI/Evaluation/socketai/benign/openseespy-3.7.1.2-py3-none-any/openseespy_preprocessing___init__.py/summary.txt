  "conclusion": "All reports correctly recognize the absence of code and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence scores are mostly appropriate, with a minor overstatement in report 5. No malicious activity or obfuscation can be inferred without code. The evaluations are consistent and justified, requiring no further adjustments."
