  "purpose": "Assess supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, network calls, file operations, data parsing, external library usage",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file write/read operations, system commands, environment variable access, data leaks",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via data processing functions, network requests, or system calls",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code patterns, unusual dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code snippets, making detailed source-to-sink analysis impossible. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero due to absence of evidence. Confidence scores are generally low, except for report 5, which assigns a high confidence despite no code being provided; this inconsistency is noted. The reasoning in all reports aligns with the lack of code, and no suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are identified. The high confidence in report 5 should be adjusted downward to reflect the absence of evidence. Overall, the assessments are conservative and justified given the available information.",
  "conclusion": "All reports correctly recognize the absence of code and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence scores are mostly appropriate, with a minor overstatement in report 5. No malicious activity or obfuscation can be inferred without code. The evaluations are consistent and justified, requiring no further adjustments.",
