{
  "purpose": "Detects system architecture and platform, then imports platform-specific 'opensees' modules accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reads system architecture via sys.maxsize; reads platform info via sys.platform; attempts to import platform-specific modules.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks or external data flows; no untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Source (system info) to import statements; no data flow beyond environment detection and import.",
  "anomalies": "Uses broad except clauses without logging or error handling; no validation of imported modules; no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment checks and imports platform-specific modules with exception handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The broad exception handling could mask import errors but does not introduce security risks. The reliance on external modules could be a dependency trust concern but not malicious. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign environment setup routine with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, primarily due to dependency trust considerations. Overall, the code is safe and standard for environment detection and import logic.",
