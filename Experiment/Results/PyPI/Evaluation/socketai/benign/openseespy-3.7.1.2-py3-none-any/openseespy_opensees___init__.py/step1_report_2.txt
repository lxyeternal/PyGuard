  "purpose": "To import the 'opensees' module based on the system platform, supporting Linux, Windows, and Mac OS.",
  "sources": "Reads system information from sys module, specifically sys.maxsize and sys.platform.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import of modules ('opensees' from platform-specific locations), which could potentially execute untrusted code if the modules are compromised or maliciously replaced.",
  "flows": "sys.maxsize and sys.platform are used to determine system architecture and platform. Based on platform, attempts to import specific modules. If import fails, raises RuntimeError.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs platform-dependent imports with try-except blocks but lacks any verification of the integrity or authenticity of imported modules. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs beyond normal platform checks.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for 64-bit system architecture by evaluating sys.maxsize, which is standard. It then determines the platform using sys.platform.startswith(), which is typical for platform-specific behavior. The imports are dynamic and wrapped in try-except blocks to handle import failures gracefully. The module paths ('openseespy...') seem to be standard, and errors are reported explicitly. No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded credentials, or network activity. The module import paths are fixed strings, and the logic is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard platform-dependent module loader for 'opensees'. It does not contain any malicious behavior or malware. It relies on external modules that, if compromised, could pose risks, but the code itself appears benign. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
