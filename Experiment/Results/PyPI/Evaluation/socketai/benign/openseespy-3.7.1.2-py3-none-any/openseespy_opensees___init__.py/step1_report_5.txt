  "purpose": "Determine the operating environment and import platform-specific modules for 'opensees' based on the system platform.",
  "sources": "sys.maxsize, sys.platform, module import statements inside try-except blocks",
  "sinks": "import statements that load 'opensees' modules based on platform",
  "flows": "sys.platform check -> conditional import -> module import (trusted source) -> potential exception handling",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad except clauses that silently catch all exceptions; no logging or error details; platform-specific imports without validation; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for 64-bit architecture by examining sys.maxsize, which is a standard method. It then selects platform-specific modules to import based on sys.platform string prefixes for Linux, Windows, and Mac. Each import is enclosed in try-except blocks that raise RuntimeError with specific messages if the import fails. No untrusted input is processed beyond environment detection, and no data is transmitted or external network calls are made. The broad exception handling could mask underlying issues but does not introduce malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears straightforward and benign, primarily setting up environment-specific imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose is to load platform-dependent 'opensees' modules after verifying system architecture. No malicious activity or malicious code patterns are present. The broad exception handling could obscure underlying import issues but does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
