{
  "purpose": "The code checks for system architecture and platform, then dynamically imports platform-specific modules related to 'opensees'.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information from sys.maxsize and sys.platform; imports modules based on platform.",
  "sinks": "Imports modules dynamically based on platform; no data sinks or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "sys.maxsize and sys.platform influence the module import path; the imports are direct and platform-dependent.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs platform-specific dynamic imports without validation beyond platform check; raises RuntimeError on failure, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script verifies that the system is 64-bit, raising an error if not. It then determines the platform and attempts to import platform-specific 'opensees' modules, raising errors if imports fail. The approach is straightforward, relying on platform detection and dynamic imports. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The code's purpose appears to be setting up environment-specific dependencies. No anomalies or obfuscated code features are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system environment checks and platform-specific module imports with standard error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The script is typical for platform-dependent setup scripts.",
