{
  "purpose": "This code determines system architecture and platform, then imports platform-specific modules for OpenSeespy, a structural analysis library.",
  "sources": "Reads system information from sys.maxsize and sys.platform.",
  "sinks": "Imports modules based on platform, which could execute platform-specific code.",
  "flows": "sys.maxsize check → platform detection → import statement → module import depending on platform.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of broad exception handling without logging may obscure errors but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script checks if the system is 64-bit, raising an error if not. Then it detects the OS platform and attempts to import specific modules accordingly, raising errors if imports fail. The exception handling captures all exceptions broadly without specific handling or logging, which might hide underlying issues but does not suggest malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated elements or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a platform-dependent importer for the OpenSeespy library, with standard system checks and exception handling. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It appears to be a legitimate setup script for environment-specific imports.",
