  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Python package setup script.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, or network operations are present.\n- URLs point to legitimate repositories related to type stubs.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which aligns with their reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of the code:** The code matches the description in the reports. It is a typical setup.py-like script for packaging, with no anomalies.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; the code is static and straightforward.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or mistakes are evident. The code follows standard packaging conventions.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- The **malware score** of 0 is justified; no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- The **security risk score** of 0 is justified; the code is purely declarative with no vulnerabilities.\n- The **obfuscated score** of 0 is justified; the code is clear and readable.\n\n### Critical points:\n- All reports are consistent, and their assessments are reasonable.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is non-executable configuration data.\n- The URLs and package data are legitimate and relevant.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Score | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0            | No malicious code or behavior detected.                     |\n| Obfuscated        | 0            | Clear, static configuration with no obfuscation.            |\n| Security Risk     | 0            | No vulnerabilities or risky operations present.             |\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.**",
