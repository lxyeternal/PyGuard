  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'types-google-cloud-ndb' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Input data from the package metadata, string variables, and the setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not write to external systems, handle untrusted input, or perform network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The long_description contains detailed documentation, no obfuscated or dynamic code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with static metadata, dependencies, package data, and URLs. No dynamic execution, input handling, or network activity. The code appears standard for Python package configuration with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It only defines package metadata and configuration parameters. No anomalies, malware, or security concerns are identified.",
