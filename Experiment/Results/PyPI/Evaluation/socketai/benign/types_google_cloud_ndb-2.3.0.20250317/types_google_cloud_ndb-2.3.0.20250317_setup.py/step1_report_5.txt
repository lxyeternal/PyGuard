  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'types-google-cloud-ndb', including metadata, dependencies, package data, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads static strings, package configuration, and metadata; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration, no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code solely performs package setup and configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and package data without any dynamic code execution, user input, or external data sources. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. All operations are typical for a package distribution script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It follows standard practices for Python packaging without any anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
