  "purpose": "This script is for setting up a Python package named 'types-google-cloud-ndb' with associated metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded strings and dictionaries within the setup() function parameters; no external inputs are read dynamically.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leakage or malicious output.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the script solely defines package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or unusual code behavior are present. All URLs point to legitimate GitHub repositories related to type stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script utilizing setuptools. It specifies package details, including name, version, description, URLs, dependencies, package data, license, and classifiers. No external input processing, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic is present. All components follow conventional patterns for Python package distribution. The URLs and data are consistent with the purpose of a type stub package. No signs of malicious or suspicious activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical and legitimate setup script for a Python package related to type stubs. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and poses no security risks.",
