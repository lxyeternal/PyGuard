  "sources": "Static variables defining package metadata, URLs, package data, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external inputs, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Static data assigned to setup() parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static setup script that defines package metadata, dependencies, package data, and URLs. It contains no dynamic code, external inputs, or network operations. All data are hardcoded and point to legitimate repositories. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or vulnerabilities are present. The code follows standard practices for Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as a standard, safe setup configuration.",
