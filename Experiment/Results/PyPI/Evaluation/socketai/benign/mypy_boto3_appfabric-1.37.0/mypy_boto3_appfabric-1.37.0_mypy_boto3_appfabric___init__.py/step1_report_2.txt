{
  "purpose": "Provide an interface for the appfabric service, including documentation and re-exports of client and paginator classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client and .paginator), reading docstring for usage instructions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; the code only imports classes and defines an alias.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, mainly re-exports and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as an interface module, importing and re-exporting classes from internal modules, and providing documentation. It does not handle user input, environment variables, or network operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code structure is typical for a Python SDK package, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK interface module with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It merely imports and exposes classes for use in other parts of the application or by end-users.",
