{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS AppFabric service constants and related service names for type safety and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys and typing (or typing_extensions) modules, and definitions of string literals assigned to type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external output; the code solely defines type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only sets up static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright statement with a future year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'Literal' depending on Python version, then defines multiple type alias constants as string literals for AWS service names and related enumerations. There are no runtime operations, external data handling, or suspicious code behaviors. All elements are static type annotations meant for type checking and documentation. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or malicious behavior is present. The copyright year is in the future, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard static type definition file for AWS SDK literals. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It serves as a type-safe way to handle string constants for AWS service names and related identifiers.",
