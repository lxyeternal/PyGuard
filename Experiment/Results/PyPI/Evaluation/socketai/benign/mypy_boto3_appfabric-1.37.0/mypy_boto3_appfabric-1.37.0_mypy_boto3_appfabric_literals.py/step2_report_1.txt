  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines type aliases for string literals used in the appfabric service, with no data processing or external interactions.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely declarative, involving no data sinks, flows, or malicious constructs.\n- **Security implication:** No malicious behavior, no data flow, no vulnerabilities.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate. Risk score of 0 is justified given the static, non-executable nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the straightforward nature of the type alias definitions and conditional import.\n- **Assessment:** No dynamic code, no external data handling, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Security implication:** No risk or malware present.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0, security risk of 0, consistent with the code's static, benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and well-justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Extensive list of resource and service name literals, with no runtime logic or data processing.\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely for type annotations, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Security implication:** No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score remains 0; risk score is 0, aligning with the static, declarative purpose.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with detailed type alias definitions and a standard version check.\n- **Assessment:** No runtime execution, data handling, or external interactions.\n- **Security implication:** No security risks or malware.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0; risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines string literal types for AWS AppFabric and related services, with a note about the future copyright year.\n- **Assessment:** The code is static, with no dynamic or executable parts. The future year is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Security implication:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score remains 0; risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with a malware score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation; all reports agree on 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the static nature and absence of external data handling, a risk score of 0 is justified across all reports.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a static, declarative module defining string literal types for type safety and documentation. It contains no executable logic, no external data processing, and no security-sensitive operations. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year, which is likely a placeholder or oversight but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate. The code is safe, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
