  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code defines type aliases for string literals related to the appfabric service, with no data processing or dynamic behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely declarative, with no malicious activity.  \n- **Risk & Malware:** Both are accurately scored as 0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — fully justified.  \n\n**Conclusion:** No issues here. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the straightforward nature of the type alias definitions and the conditional import for Python version compatibility.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; no dynamic or malicious behavior.  \n- **Risk & Malware:** Appropriately scored as 0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — justified.  \n\n**Conclusion:** No concerns; the code is a standard type declaration module.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Extensive list of string literals for AWS resource and service names, with version-aware import of `Literal`.  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes that this is static, declarative code with no runtime or dynamic behavior.  \n- **Risk & Malware:** Both are accurately scored as 0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — well-founded.  \n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe and serves as a static type hinting aid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the static nature, version compatibility, and absence of malicious patterns.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate; no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present.  \n- **Risk & Malware:** Correctly scored as 0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — justified.  \n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Again, a set of static type alias definitions with a note about the future-dated copyright year (2025).  \n- **Assessment:** The mention of the future year is unusual but not malicious. The code remains static, with no dynamic or executable parts.  \n- **Risk & Malware:** Both are correctly scored as 0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — justified.  \n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code content:** Purely static type alias definitions for string literals.\n- **Behavior:** No runtime logic, data processing, external inputs, or network activity.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** None. No backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None identified.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports.\n\n### Final Justification:\nAll reports correctly identify the benign, declarative nature of this module. The only minor point is the future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not harmful or malicious.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious intent or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk, no dynamic behavior, no external data handling)\n\nThis code is a standard, safe type declaration module used for static type checking in Python projects.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications needed. The code is entirely benign and serves a purely documentation and type safety purpose.",
