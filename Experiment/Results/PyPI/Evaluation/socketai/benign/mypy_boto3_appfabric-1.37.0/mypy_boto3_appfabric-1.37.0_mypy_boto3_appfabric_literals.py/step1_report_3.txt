{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AppFabric-related constants used in type annotations.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version from sys.version_info to determine import source. It also defines multiple Literal type aliases.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; the code solely defines type aliases and imports, with no runtime data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to output; the code only sets up type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is purely declarative and static.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines multiple type aliases as Literal strings, serving as constants for type annotations. It includes extensive lists of string literals for various AWS resource and service names, with no dynamic or executable logic. No malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type declaration module, providing string literal types for use in type annotations. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and is purely declarative. The code appears safe and intentionally designed for type hinting purposes.",
