  "purpose": "Define type literals for appfabric service and related enumerations to facilitate type checking in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions, and assignment of string literals to type aliases.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code only defines type aliases and does not process external input or data streams.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only establishes static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The code contains straightforward type annotations and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module defining string literal types for use with type annotations. It includes a version check to import 'Literal' from different modules depending on Python version. No dynamic code execution, no external input handling, no obfuscated or malicious constructs are present. The purpose is purely to enhance type safety and code clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type alias definitions intended for type checking support. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected.",
