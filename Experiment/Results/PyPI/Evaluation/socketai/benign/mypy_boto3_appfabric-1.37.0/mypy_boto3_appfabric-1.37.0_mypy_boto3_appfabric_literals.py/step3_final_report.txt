  "purpose": "Define static type aliases for AWS AppFabric service literals and related constants to enhance type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Constant string literals assigned to type aliases, conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; static type annotations without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual future copyright year (2025), likely a placeholder or typo, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using Python's 'Literal' for string constants representing AWS resource and service names. The conditional import ensures compatibility across Python versions. No dynamic code, data processing, or external data handling is present. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The only minor anomaly is the future year, which does not impact security or functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module for type annotations with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and risk score of 0 are appropriate. The code poses no threat and is suitable for use in type checking contexts.",
