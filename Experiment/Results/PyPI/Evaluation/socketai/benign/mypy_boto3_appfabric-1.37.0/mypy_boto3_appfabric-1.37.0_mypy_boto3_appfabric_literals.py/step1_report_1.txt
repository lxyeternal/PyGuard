  "purpose": "Define type aliases for various string literals used in the appfabric service for type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions assigned to variables, importing sys module, and conditional import of Literal based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code primarily consists of type alias declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs type annotation setup using Literal types to specify valid string values for various identifiers. It conditionally imports the 'Literal' type based on the Python version. No input/output operations, network activity, or data manipulation occur. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are evident. The code is purely declarative, serving as a type-safe schema for the application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module defining string literal type aliases for type hinting purposes. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
