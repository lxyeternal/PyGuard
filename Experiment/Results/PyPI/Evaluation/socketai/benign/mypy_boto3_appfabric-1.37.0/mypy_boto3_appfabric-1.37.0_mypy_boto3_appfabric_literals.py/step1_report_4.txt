  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AppFabric service literals used in type annotations.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.version_info check for importing Literal, and assignment of string literals to type variables.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-critical actions.",
  "flows": "Literal type definitions serve as type annotations; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward type alias definitions. The version check for importing Literal is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for various string literal types used within the AWS SDK for AppFabric. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility. All type definitions are simple string literals assigned to descriptive variable names. There are no functions, input handling, or dynamic code execution that could be exploited. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic is present. The file's structure and content are consistent with a type definition module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module defining string literal types for type annotations. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security vulnerabilities. The code appears to be purely for type hinting and documentation purposes.",
