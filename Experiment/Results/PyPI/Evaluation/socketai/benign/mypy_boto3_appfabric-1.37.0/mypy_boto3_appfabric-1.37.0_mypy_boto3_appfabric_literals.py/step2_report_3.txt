  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, source code, and the details provided.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static type alias definitions using `Literal` types for various AWS resource and service identifiers.\n- The code includes conditional imports of `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- No input/output, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are detected.\n- The code is purely declarative, serving as type annotations for better type safety and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Define type aliases for appfabric service literals.  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate. The report correctly identifies the code as benign, static, and purely for type hinting.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Define type literals for appfabric and related enums.  \n- Confidence: 1.0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n- **Verdict:** Correct. The analysis aligns with the code's static, non-executable nature.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Define string literal types for AppFabric constants.  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Define string literal types for AppFabric service literals.  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n- **Verdict:** Correct. The code is straightforward type alias definitions.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Define AWS AppFabric literals, with a note on the future copyright year.  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n- **Verdict:** The mention of the 2025 year is unusual but not malicious. The code remains static and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Cross-Analysis & Consistency Checks:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static, declarative, and intended solely for type annotations.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The only unusual aspect is the copyright year (2025), which is in the future, but this is not a security concern—just a possible typo or placeholder.\n\n### **Scores & Justification:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very low, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Evaluation:**\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward static type alias declaration module.\n- No dynamic, malicious, or obfuscated behavior is present.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is benign.\n\n**Therefore, I recommend:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering the future year as a minor inconsistency, but not a security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is safe, static, and serves as a type hinting utility for AWS SDKs. No security concerns or malicious behaviors are evident. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n- No further action needed.",
