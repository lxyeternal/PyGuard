  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any discrepancies, potential issues, or inconsistencies.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a static, declarative module defining string literal types for AWS AppFabric and related services.\n- The code uses conditional imports for `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- No report mentions any dynamic code execution, external input handling, or data sinks.\n- No report indicates any obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent.\n- The only anomaly noted is the future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or vulnerabilities:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is purely for type annotations, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code patterns are present.\n   - The code's purpose is static type safety, not execution.\n\n2. **Obfuscation:**\n   - No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward and declarative.\n\n3. **Malware and security risk scores:**\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n4. **Future copyright year (2025):**\n   - One report notes this as unusual but not malicious. It could be a placeholder or a typo, but it doesn't impact security.\n\n5. **Scores consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all are low or zero, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n6. **Potential issues:**\n   - The only minor concern is the future year, which might suggest placeholder content or a typo, but it does not introduce security risks.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- The obfuscated score is appropriately 0.\n- The security risk score should stay at 0, given the static, non-executable nature.\n- The high confidence (1 or 1.0) across reports is justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, well-structured set of type alias definitions for static type checking. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present. The only noteworthy point is the future year in the copyright statement, which is likely a placeholder.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric            | Estimated Score |\n|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware           | 0               |\n| Obfuscated        | 0               |\n| Security Risk     | 0               |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across all reports.",
