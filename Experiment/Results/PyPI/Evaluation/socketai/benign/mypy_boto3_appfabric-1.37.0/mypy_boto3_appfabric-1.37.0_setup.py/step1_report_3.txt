{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-appfabric package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The script reads the README.md file for long description; input sources include package data files and dependency specifications.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be package data files and dependency specifications, but they do not process untrusted input or execute external code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script only reads static files and defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path for reading a static README.md file, then calls setuptools.setup() with predefined package metadata and dependencies. There are no dynamic code execution, environment variable manipulations, or network operations. The dependencies are fixed, and no untrusted input is processed. The code is typical for a Python package setup, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It securely defines package metadata and dependencies without processing untrusted input or executing arbitrary code.",
