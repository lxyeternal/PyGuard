  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-appfabric package, defining package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description; importing setuptools for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data processing operations detected.",
  "flows": "Reading file content into LONG_DESCRIPTION variable, then passing static metadata into setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. No dynamic execution or external data manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: imports Path for reading a file, reads README.md content, and calls setup() with static arguments. No user input handling, no network operations, no secret or credential management. The only file operation is reading a local README file, which is typical for package descriptions. All code is straightforward and adheres to common setup patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses static data for package metadata and does not perform any risky operations.",
