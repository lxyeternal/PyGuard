{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and paginator classes for the 'appfabric' service client in boto3, facilitating type-safe pagination.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class methods accessing paginator functionality.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods accepting arbitrary keyword arguments and returning PageIterator objects; no untrusted data processing or external communications detected.",
  "flows": "Methods receive kwargs with type definitions and produce paginated responses; no data flows indicating malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; usage of type annotations and conditional imports appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type annotations and subclasses for boto3 paginators, incorporating type checking with conditional imports based on Python version. No external data inputs or outputs involve untrusted sources. The classes inherit from boto3's Paginator and override the 'paginate' method with type annotations, following standard patterns. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, file modifications, or secret handling. The use of type hints and conditional imports is consistent with best practices, and no suspicious or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured implementation of paginator classes with type annotations for the 'appfabric' boto3 client. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and intended solely for type safety and improved developer experience.",
