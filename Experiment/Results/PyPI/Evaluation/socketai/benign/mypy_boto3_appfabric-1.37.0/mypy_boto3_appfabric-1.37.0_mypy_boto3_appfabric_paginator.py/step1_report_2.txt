{
  "purpose": "Define paginator classes for the boto3 appfabric client with type annotations and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Code reads static type definitions, version info, and boto3 paginator classes; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no external data handling or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable—code consists of class definitions and type annotations without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors observed; the code strictly defines type-safe paginator wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type-annotated subclasses of boto3's Paginator for the appfabric service, with conditional imports for typing extensions and detailed documentation links. No runtime data handling, network communication, or code execution logic that could be malicious. All components are static type definitions, ensuring proper type checking without executing external or unsafe code. The structure appears standard for boto3 stub definitions and adheres to typical Python typing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of paginator class definitions for type annotations and documentation purposes. No malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security risks identified.",
