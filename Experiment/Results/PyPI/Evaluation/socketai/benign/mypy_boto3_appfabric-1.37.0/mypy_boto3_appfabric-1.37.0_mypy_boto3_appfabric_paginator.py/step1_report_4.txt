{
  "purpose": "Define paginators for the boto3 appfabric client, providing type annotations and doc links for SDK documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; usage of sys.version_info for conditional import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, network calls, or data leaks present in the code.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code mainly declares classes and type annotations without data flows or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is standard SDK stub and paginator class definitions with type annotations and docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports required modules and defines paginator classes with type annotations and conditional imports based on Python version. No data input, output, or external network activity is present. The classes extend boto3 paginator classes, overriding 'paginate' methods with appropriate type annotations and documentation links. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present. The structure and purpose are aligned with SDK documentation and type hinting, indicating standard and benign code intended for type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of paginator classes for boto3 appfabric client with type annotations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It appears to be a well-structured SDK stub code for type safety and documentation.",
