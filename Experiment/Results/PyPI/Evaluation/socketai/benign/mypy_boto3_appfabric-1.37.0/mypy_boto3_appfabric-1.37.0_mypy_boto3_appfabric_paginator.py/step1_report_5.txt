  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the AWS appfabric service client, enabling type-checked pagination of API responses.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.version_info check, type definitions, class method definitions (paginate).",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes to files, sends data over network, or executes untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code is for type annotations and class structure, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code consists solely of type annotations, class definitions, and documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured paginator classes for the AWS appfabric boto3 client, with proper type annotations, conditional imports based on Python version, and clear documentation links. It does not contain any code execution, data handling, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured type definition module for boto3 paginators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign type definition module for boto3 AWS SDK paginators. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
