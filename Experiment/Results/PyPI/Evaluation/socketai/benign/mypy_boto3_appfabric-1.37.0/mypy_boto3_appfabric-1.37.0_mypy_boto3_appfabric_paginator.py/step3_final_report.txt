  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the boto3 'appfabric' service, intended for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Class inheritance from boto3.paginate.Paginator, method parameters via **kwargs with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or sinks; no network or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to paginate methods, which return PageIterator objects; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; static class definitions with no dynamic or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of static type stub classes for boto3 paginators, with conditional imports for compatibility, and documentation links. It contains no runtime logic, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with standard boto3 stub patterns. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely for static type annotations and documentation. All reports correctly identify the lack of malicious behavior and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code is safe and appropriate for its intended static analysis purpose.",
