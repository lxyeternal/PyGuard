  "purpose": "Provides type annotations and paginator classes for the AWS AppFabric service client, facilitating type-checked pagination of API responses.",
  "sources": "Defines type annotations, imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local type definitions. Reads sys.version_info for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "Uses type annotations for paginator methods, no untrusted data sources or sinks are evident. No data leakage or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Type annotations and class inheritance structures define method signatures; no runtime data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears to be standard, generated type definitions for boto3 pagination. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginators for AWS AppFabric with detailed type annotations, conditional imports based on Python version, and documentation links. It relies on standard boto3 and typing modules, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The structure is typical for type stub generation, with no signs of malicious behavior. The use of TYPE_CHECKING guards is standard for type hints, and no untrusted inputs or data leaks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of type annotations and class definitions for boto3 paginators. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a type-stub package to aid static analysis and IDE support.",
