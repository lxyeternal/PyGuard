  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies that the code is for type annotations and interface definitions for the AppFabric client.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No data sources or sinks, no runtime logic, only interface definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clearly states that the code is purely declarative, generated for static type checking, with no malicious intent.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0.0 are appropriate. No security threat.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type annotations and API interactions.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Methods invoke AWS API calls; no external data leaks or malicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Confirms the code is standard SDK interface code, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0.0 are justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, describing the SDK interface.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No malicious data handling; primarily method signatures.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Validates the code as a standard SDK interface with no malicious intent.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0.0 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar description, emphasizing type safety and SDK interaction.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No direct data leaks; method signatures for API calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes the code as a typical SDK wrapper, with no malicious activity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — slightly above zero, but still very low, reflecting minimal concern. Given the static nature, this is acceptable.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as others, describing a type-safe SDK interface.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No data leaks or malicious flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Confirms the code is a standard, static interface without malicious intent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malware detected.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as static interface definitions, primarily for type safety and documentation.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The only minor concern is the security risk score of 0.1 in report 4, which is still very low and justifiable given the minimal potential surface area.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is clear, readable, and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — no security risk detected.\n\n**Overall, this code is a standard, static SDK interface with no security threats.**",
