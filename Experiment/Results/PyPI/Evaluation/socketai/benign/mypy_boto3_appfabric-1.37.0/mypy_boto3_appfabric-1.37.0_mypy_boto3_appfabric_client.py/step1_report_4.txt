  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the AWS AppFabric service, providing methods to interact with AppFabric resources via boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class definitions and method implementations.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters unpacking kwargs into request type definitions; generating URLs and handling responses.",
  "flows": "Input data (kwargs) passed into methods -> unpacked into request type definitions -> sent to AWS APIs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code. Usage of standard SDK practices. No obfuscated code or hidden network activities.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a client interface for AWS AppFabric with type annotations, method signatures, and documentation links. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or file operations directly. No dynamic code execution, suspicious data handling, or malicious behavior detected. All operations are standard SDK method wrappers with type safety and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard, well-structured type-annotated SDK client interface for AWS AppFabric, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It mainly serves as a type-safe wrapper around boto3's client methods.",
