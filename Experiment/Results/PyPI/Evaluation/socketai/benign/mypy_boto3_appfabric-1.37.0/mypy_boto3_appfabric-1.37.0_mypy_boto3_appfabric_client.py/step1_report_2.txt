  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS AppFabric client in boto3-stubs, facilitating type-safe AWS API interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, typing, botocore modules, local modules (.paginator, .type_defs), and builtins or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "Methods invoking AWS API calls via boto3, which could potentially send or receive data. No direct sinks for malicious payloads or command execution are present. Methods return API responses or metadata.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (kwargs, operation_name, params) flow into boto3 API method calls, which then produce responses or generate URLs. No data leaks or external data flows are evident outside API interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code is primarily type annotations, interface definitions, and method signatures for API calls. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for AWS AppFabric client with methods corresponding to AWS API operations, including property and method annotations. It uses type hints for better type safety and overloading for paginators. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are observed. All code appears to be standard SDK interface definitions with no hidden or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical interface definition for AWS SDK with type hints. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The structure is consistent with well-formed, purpose-specific API wrapper code. No security risks are detected in this code segment.",
