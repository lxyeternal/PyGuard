  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the AppFabric client, serving as static type hints for SDK usage.",
  "sources": "Imports, class and method signatures, type annotations, and constant definitions; no runtime data input or external sources.",
  "sinks": "API method calls that interact with AWS services; no data leaks or external outputs within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Parameters passed into methods, which invoke AWS API calls; no untrusted data flow or data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured SDK interface with type annotations for static type checking. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external data handling. The methods are purely signatures for API calls, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minimal security concern arises from the fact that these methods invoke network operations, but this is inherent to SDK usage and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static, type-safe interface for the AWS AppFabric SDK, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It functions solely as a declarative wrapper for API interactions, and there is no evidence of malware or security risks.",
