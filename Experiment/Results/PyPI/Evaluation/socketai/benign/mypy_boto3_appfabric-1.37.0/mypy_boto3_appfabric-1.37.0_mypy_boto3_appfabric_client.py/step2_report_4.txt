  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code is for type annotations and interface definitions for the AppFabric client, with no external data input or untrusted sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or data flows that could lead to malicious activity; only method signatures and type annotations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. The code is purely declarative, serving as static type hints.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No security risks or malware present; high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is a static interface with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, the focus is on type annotations and interface definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API calls via boto3, which could send/receive data, but no signs of malicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation. Standard SDK interface.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior; high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is a standard SDK interface with no malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, defining a client interface with type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods invoke AWS API calls; no malicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or patterns; standard SDK pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No security issues; high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Interface for AWS AppFabric with method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data passed into API calls; no malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Static interface code, standard SDK wrapper.\n- **Conclusion & Security Risk:** No malicious activity; security risk is minimal (0.1), possibly due to the nature of API calls, but not malicious.\n\n**Assessment:** The security risk score is slightly above zero but justified given that the code interfaces with external systems, which could potentially be exploited if misused. However, in this static form, it poses no direct risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, type annotations and interface definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API invocation, no malicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity; confidence slightly below 1, possibly due to cautious interpretation.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings; no malware.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code content:** All reports correctly identify that this is a static, interface/typing module for the boto3 AppFabric client.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero in all reports, consistent with the static, declarative nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, as no obfuscation or suspicious code is present.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, mostly zero or near-zero, justified because this code does not perform any runtime operations, data processing, or external data handling.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0.0** across all reports.\n- The **obfuscated score** should be **0.0**.\n- The **risk score** can stay at **0.0** or very close to it, as this code is purely declarative and does not pose runtime security risks.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured type annotation and interface definition for an AWS SDK client. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. It serves as a static, type-safe wrapper for API calls, with no security concerns.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0  \n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
