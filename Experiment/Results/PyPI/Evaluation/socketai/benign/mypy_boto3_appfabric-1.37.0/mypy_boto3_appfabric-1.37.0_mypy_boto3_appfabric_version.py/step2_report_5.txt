  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a static version string (`\"1.37.0\"`) to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no dynamic inputs, external data reads, or suspicious behaviors.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for package version declarations.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence` = 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated` = 0\n     - `malware` = 0\n     - `securityRisk` = 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The `malware` score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The `securityRisk` score is also 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Since there's no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concern, these scores are justified.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward analysis; no assumptions about hidden malicious code are made.\n   - The assessments are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n6. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the findings and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain **0**. The code is a standard version string assignment with no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain **0**. The code is clear and un-obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain **0**. No security risk is present.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and is consistent with best security practices.",
