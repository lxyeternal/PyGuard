  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version declaration, no embedded code, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string '1.37.0' to __version__, which is a common practice for package versioning. There is no user input, network activity, or complex logic. The copyright statement does not introduce any security issues. The code is minimal and clear, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply declares a version string for the package with no malicious or security concern. It is a standard pattern used in Python packages.",
