  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code in question is a simple static assignment of a version string to `__version__`, accompanied by a copyright comment.\n- All reports agree that there are no dynamic inputs, external data, or suspicious behaviors.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are identified in any report.\n- The code is standard practice for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- **Issue presence:** No, all reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Errors or flaws:** None. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely static and contains no dynamic or external data, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n- The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as there is no obfuscation.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is straightforward.\n- The reports correctly interpret the code's purpose and content.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| Malware          | 0            |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            |\n| Security Risk    | 0            |\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
