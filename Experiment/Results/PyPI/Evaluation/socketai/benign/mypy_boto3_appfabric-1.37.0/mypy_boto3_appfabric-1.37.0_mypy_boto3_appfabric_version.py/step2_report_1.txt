  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Logic**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a static string (`\"1.37.0\"`) to the `__version__` variable, accompanied by a copyright comment.  \n   There are no dynamic inputs, no external data sources, no code execution, and no obfuscation.  \n   **Conclusion**: The code is straightforward, with no malicious logic or hidden behavior.\n\n2. **Presence of Anomalies or Malicious Indicators**:  \n   All reports correctly identify the absence of anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.  \n   **Conclusion**: No signs of malicious activity or security concerns.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasoning**:  \n   - **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity.  \n   - **Malware score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the lack of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security risk score**: All reports assign 0, justified by the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Errors in Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as standard version declaration without any vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions**:  \n   No assumptions are made beyond the code's straightforward nature. The reports do not claim any hidden malicious intent or obfuscation, which aligns with the code content.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency & Justification**:  \n   The scores are appropriate and consistent across all reports. Given the code's simplicity, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected or suggested.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Clear, straightforward code.  \n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks present.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThis code is a minimal, standard version declaration in Python, serving as package metadata. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and is correctly scored.\n\n---\n\n**Note for future analysis**: Always verify if the code introduces any dynamic or external data handling. In this case, static assignment and comments suffice to conclude safety.",
