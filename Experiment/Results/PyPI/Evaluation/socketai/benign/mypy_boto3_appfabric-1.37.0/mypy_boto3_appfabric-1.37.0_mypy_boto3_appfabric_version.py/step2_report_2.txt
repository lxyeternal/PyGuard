  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Logic Confirmation:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static string `\"1.37.0\"` to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no dynamic inputs, no external data sources, no function calls, no obfuscation, and no embedded code or secrets.\n   - The code is a standard version declaration, common in Python packages, with a copyright comment.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No logical errors or misleading conclusions are evident.\n   - They correctly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious activity.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` = 0\n     - `obfuscated` = 0\n     - `securityRisk` = 0\n     - `confidence` = 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Risk Score Analysis:**\n   - Since the code is purely a static version string assignment with no external interactions or malicious indicators, the risk score of 0 (or 0.5 at most) is justified.\n   - The reports' risk scores of 0 are reasonable.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports, reflecting no malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any harmful actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions & Consistency:**\n   - All reports assume the code is just a version string, which is accurate.\n   - No assumptions about hidden behavior or obfuscation are made; the assessments are consistent and justified.\n\n7. **Overall Evaluation & Personal Estimate:**\n   - Based on the analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions.\n   - The code is a standard, benign version declaration.\n   - The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at 0.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat.",
