  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a static string for version tracking.",
  "sources": "No external sources; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version string assignment with comment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string '1.37.0' to __version__, with a copyright comment. No dynamic inputs, external data, code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is a standard practice for package metadata declaration. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with no malicious or security concerns. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, with full confidence. No anomalies or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version declaration with no malicious activity or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
