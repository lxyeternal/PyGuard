  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for appfabric service API interactions in Python.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data sources dynamically; all data is defined via type annotations and static definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks exist that process untrusted data; the code only defines data structures.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code follows standard type annotation practices and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type definitions for a Python SDK or client library for an appfabric API. It uses conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions and defines various TypedDict classes to model API request/response structures. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data processing is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The copyright date appears future-dated (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, static set of type annotations for API data modeling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate SDK type definitions file with no harmful intent.",
