  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scoring consistency, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely static type definitions, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The copyright date is future-dated (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected. The report correctly identifies the code as safe, static, and well-structured.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Fully aligned. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; static type definitions with no suspicious behavior. The use of conditional imports is standard.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The analysis is accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; static type annotations, no runtime logic, no external data handling. The version-dependent imports are typical.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious indicators or obfuscation. The confidence is slightly lower (0.95), but given the content, this is reasonable.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; static data definitions, no executable code, no external data processing.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity. The analysis is correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar static type definitions, with mention of environment detection via sys.version_info. Slightly elevated securityRisk score (0.1), justified by the note that the code reads environment info, but no actual malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code only reads environment info for compatibility, which is standard. The securityRisk score of 0.1 is conservative but acceptable, considering the environment detection aspect.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No need to increase risk scores or flag malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores should stay at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the static, declarative nature of the code, and no dynamic or external data handling, the risk remains minimal. The slight securityRisk of 0.1 in report 5 is justified due to environment detection, but overall, the code remains safe.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated security risk score:** 0.05 (a conservative, minimal risk for environment detection, but effectively negligible)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations with no malicious intent or security concerns. No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
