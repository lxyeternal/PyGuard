  "purpose": "Define type annotations for appfabric service data structures and request/response schemas for a Python SDK.",
  "sources": "Static type definitions, imported literals, and version-dependent imports. No external data input or runtime data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs present within this module.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; the code only declares static type structures without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Usage of version-dependent imports appears standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of type definitions for API request and response structures using TypedDict. It imports literals and conditionally imports modules based on Python version for compatibility, which is typical. No runtime code, input handling, or external calls are present. No signs of malicious payloads or hidden behaviors are evident. The presence of version checks is normal for compatibility and does not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is well-structured and appears to be part of a larger SDK or client library for interacting with a service, with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, static set of type definitions intended for SDK data modeling. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are identified. It is safe for use within a secure development environment.",
