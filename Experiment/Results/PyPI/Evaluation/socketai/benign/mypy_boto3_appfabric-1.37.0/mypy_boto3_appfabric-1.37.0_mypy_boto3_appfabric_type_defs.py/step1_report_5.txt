{
  "purpose": "This code provides type definitions for the appfabric service, mainly for static type checking and API schema documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from import statements, sys.version_info for environment detection, and class attribute definitions. It also reads external literals imported from other modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data are present. The code defines data structures without executing or handling untrusted input at runtime.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows or untrusted data passing from sources to sinks, as this code only contains static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports modules based on Python version, which is normal. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are observed. No obfuscated code, malicious commands, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely for defining type annotations using TypedDict, conditional imports based on Python version, and listing exported names. It includes no executable logic, network operations, or data handling beyond static type annotations. The imports are standard and do not perform any malicious actions. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or suspicious external interactions. The code appears to be a legitimate schema and type definition module for a SDK or API client, intended for static type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward, well-structured set of type definitions for the appfabric service, with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It contains no code that executes runtime actions or communicates externally. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
