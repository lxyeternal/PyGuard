  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the appfabric service SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, defines constants, and declares TypedDict classes representing data structures.",
  "sinks": "No identifiable sinks; no data is processed or transmitted in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic. Use of conditional imports based on sys.version_info is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type annotations, TypedDict class definitions, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. No runtime logic, network operations, or dynamic execution present. The presence of copyright notice and documentation links does not indicate malicious intent. No unusual or obfuscated code structures, nor any code that manipulates data in a malicious manner. The structure and content are consistent with SDK type definitions, which are inherently safe. No signs of hidden backdoors, credential theft, or unauthorized data access. The code appears to be purely declarative, intended for type hinting and code clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a set of static type definitions for a Python SDK, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is well-structured, uses standard practices, and contains no suspicious or harmful code.",
