  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** All reports confirm that the code consists solely of static type annotations, TypedDict class definitions, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and documentation comments. No runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling is present.\n\n- **Sources & Sinks:** No external data sources or sinks are involved. The code only defines data structures used for API interactions.\n\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. Use of version-dependent imports is standard practice.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusions:** All reports agree that the code is a legitimate, static SDK type definitions file, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Behavior & Risks:**  \n  The code is purely declarative—no dynamic execution, no network calls, no input handling, no code injection points. The use of conditional imports for Python version compatibility is common and not suspicious.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's static, transparent nature.\n\n- **Potential Security Risks:**  \n  The only minor concern is the \"securityRisk\" score of 0.1 in report 5, which likely stems from the use of conditional imports and documentation, not from any actual vulnerability.\n\n- **Future-Dated Copyright:**  \n  The mention of 2025 is unusual but not malicious; it could be a placeholder or future planning date.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores Justification:**  \n  All scores seem reasonable given the static, safe nature of the code. The minimal \"securityRisk\" of 0.1 in report 5 might be a conservative default; it does not indicate actual risk.\n\n- **Higher Risk Scores?**  \n  No reason to increase malware or obfuscated scores; the code is benign.\n\n- **Potential Assumptions:**  \n  The reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent, focusing on static analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall malware score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, static, and standard.  \n**Risk score:** **0** — no security risks identified; the minimal \"securityRisk\" in one report is acceptable and not indicative of actual threat.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations for an SDK. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and is safe for deployment or inclusion in a larger codebase.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0; keep the risk score at 0, as the code is purely declarative and safe.",
