  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report in detail.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** The report correctly identifies that the code only contains static type annotations and data structure definitions for the appfabric SDK. No dynamic or runtime logic is present.\n\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hardcoded secrets. The future-dated copyright (2025) is unusual but not malicious.\n\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** The report assigns a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code. The security risk is also 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate. No security concerns are evident.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Correctly notes the code is purely static type definitions with no data processing or external data handling.\n\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The use of conditional imports for compatibility is standard.\n\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate. Security risk is 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Accurately describes the code as static type definitions, with no runtime or external data interaction.\n\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior. Use of version-dependent imports is typical.\n\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Malware score of 0 is correct. Security risk is 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and well-founded.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Correctly states the code is for type annotations, with no runtime logic or data flow.\n\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The code is standard for SDK type definitions.\n\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Malware score of 0 matches the analysis. Security risk is 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Also correctly identifies static type definitions, no dynamic data handling.\n\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets. The mention of environment detection via `sys.version_info` is normal.\n\n- **Security Risk:** The report assigns a slightly higher security risk score of 0.1, citing the environment detection code as a minor concern.\n\n- **Justification for Security Risk Score:**  \n  The use of `sys.version_info` for conditional imports is standard practice for compatibility and does not introduce security vulnerabilities. It does not execute untrusted code or handle untrusted data. The minimal risk score of 0.1 seems to overstate the concern; it's a common pattern with no security implications.\n\n- **Malware Score:** Correctly 0, as no malicious behavior is present.\n\n**Score Adjustment Recommendation:**  \n- **Security Risk:** Reduce from 0.1 to 0.0. The code's environment detection does not pose any security risk or attack vector.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type annotations with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are appropriately 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk score in Report 5 should be lowered from 0.1 to 0.0, as the environment detection code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK type definitions module with no signs of supply chain attack, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The future-dated copyright (2025) is unusual but not malicious. It could be a placeholder or a typo, but it does not impact security.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No security concerns. The code is safe for integration into a development environment.",
