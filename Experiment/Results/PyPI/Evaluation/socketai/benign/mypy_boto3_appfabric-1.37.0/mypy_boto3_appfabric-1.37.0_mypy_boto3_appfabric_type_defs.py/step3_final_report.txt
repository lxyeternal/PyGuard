  "purpose": "Type annotations for appfabric service type definitions, providing static data structures for SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment info via sys.version_info for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; purely static type definitions.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; only static class and type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional imports based on Python version; future-dated copyright (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is entirely static, consisting of TypedDict classes, conditional imports for compatibility, and documentation comments. No executable logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. The environment detection via sys.version_info is standard for compatibility and does not introduce security vulnerabilities. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected. The minimal security risk score (0.1) in one report is likely a conservative default; the actual code poses negligible risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, static SDK type definitions module with no malicious intent or security concerns. All signals indicate a safe, well-structured codebase. Scores for malware and obfuscation are 0; security risk is also 0, with the minor note that environment detection does not pose any threat.",
