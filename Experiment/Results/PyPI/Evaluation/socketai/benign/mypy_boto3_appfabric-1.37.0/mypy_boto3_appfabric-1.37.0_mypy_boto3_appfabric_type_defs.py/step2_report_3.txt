  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided and assessing the security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely static type definitions, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling. The future-dated copyright (2025) is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the static, declarative nature of the code, with standard compatibility imports and no runtime or external data processing.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious indicators.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no security concerns.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms the code's static, type-only nature, with no dynamic execution or external data handling. The version-dependent imports are standard practice.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no risks detected.\n- **Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, it highlights the absence of executable logic, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. The code's purpose as a type definition module is clear.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — transparent code.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Also notes the purely static nature, with attention to the environment detection via `sys.version_info`. The mention of no malicious behavior is correct.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious indicators.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — a slight concern due to the `sys.version_info` check, but this is a standard compatibility pattern, not malicious.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The minimal risk score (0.1) is acceptable, as it is a common practice and does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n- **Verdict:** The score is reasonable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports agree on 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The highest is 0.1, justified by the version-dependent imports, which are standard and not malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\nGiven the comprehensive analysis, I concur with the assessments provided. The code is a static, well-structured set of type definitions with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is purely declarative, intended for static type checking in a Python SDK. No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. The minor version check is standard practice and does not pose any security threat.\n\n**Conclusion:** The supply chain security risk for this code is negligible. It appears to be a legitimate, safe SDK type definitions file.",
