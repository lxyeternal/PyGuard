{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for the appfabric service's data structures to ensure type safety and improve code clarity.",
  "sources": "Type annotations primarily read static type information and imported literals; no user input or external data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points to untrusted sources; the code only defines data structures without any data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists as this code solely contains type definitions without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is standard for type annotations in Python, including conditional imports based on Python version. No signs of malicious backdoors, hidden functions, or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type definitions for a Python SDK or client library, facilitating static type checking. It uses conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions and imports literals and other types from external modules. The structure is typical for such type definition files, with no executable logic, network operations, or dynamic code execution. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or other indicators of malicious intent. Overall, it appears to be a benign, standard set of type annotations meant for a public SDK or library.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python type definition module for an SDK, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no executable code or suspicious patterns, serving solely to define data types for type checking and documentation purposes.",
