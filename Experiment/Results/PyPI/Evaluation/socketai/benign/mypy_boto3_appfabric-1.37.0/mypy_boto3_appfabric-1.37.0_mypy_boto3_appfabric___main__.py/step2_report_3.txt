  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The script is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package information or version based on command-line arguments.\n- It reads `sys.argv` to determine whether to print version info (`--version`) or package info.\n- It outputs static text via `sys.stdout.write`.\n- No user input beyond command-line args, no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no secrets, and no suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No, the code is straightforward and benign.\n- **Malicious activity:** None observed.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Sensitive data or secrets:** None.\n- **External communication:** None.\n- **Code quality:** Clear, static, and simple.\n\n### Review of each report:\nAll five reports agree on the benign nature, emphasizing the static, informational purpose, and lack of suspicious behavior. They correctly identify the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, justified by the clear, static code.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0.1 in some cases, perhaps to account for minimal risk if the script were modified. However, as it stands, there's no real security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity).\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation).\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk).\n\nThe code is a benign CLI utility with no supply chain threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the consensus in the reports. The code is straightforward, static, and safe. The scores should reflect this.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0**\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No additional concerns or hidden issues are apparent. The reports are accurate, and the code is safe.",
