  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line argument input",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for outputting static strings",
  "flows": "sys.argv (source) triggers sys.stdout.write (sink) based on argument check",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static with no dynamic or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code reads command-line arguments to determine whether to print version info or package info, then outputs predefined static strings. It does not process untrusted input beyond argument checking, makes no network calls, executes no dynamic code, and contains no obfuscation or secrets. The code is static, simple, and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The low risk and malware scores are justified, and the code poses minimal supply chain threat. The assessments across reports are consistent and accurate.",
