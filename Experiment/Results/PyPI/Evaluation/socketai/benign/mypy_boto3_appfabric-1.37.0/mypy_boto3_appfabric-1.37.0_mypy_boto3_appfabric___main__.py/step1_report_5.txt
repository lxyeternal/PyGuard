  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint that displays package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv, outputs to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs strings to stdout via sys.stdout.write().",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, calls print_version() and outputs version; otherwise calls print_info() to output package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic CLI functionality: displaying package info and version. It reads command-line args and outputs static strings. No user input, no external data fetch, no untrusted data handling, and no network activity. The code structure is straightforward and lacks any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple CLI utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only outputs static information based on command-line arguments. No malicious or security-compromising behavior detected.",
