{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface entry point that outputs package information or version details based on user input.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and outputs information via sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are sent to sys.stdout; no other sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "User input via command-line arguments influences the flow, leading to output functions that display static information.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. The data printed is static and informational.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys to handle command-line arguments and output. It defines functions to print package info and version, which are static texts. The main() function checks for '--version' in sys.argv and calls appropriate functions. There are no inputs from untrusted sources other than command-line args, and outputs are fixed informational messages. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are evident. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package and version info. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe for use.",
