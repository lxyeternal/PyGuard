{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a CLI entrypoint to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and outputs information to stdout.",
  "targets": "The stdout output could be viewed by any user executing the script; no external data is fetched or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv -> Conditional check -> Output via sys.stdout.write",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and informational.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys to access command-line arguments and stdout. It defines two functions to print package info and version. The main() function checks if '--version' is in sys.argv, then prints version; otherwise, it prints package info. The code is simple, does not process untrusted input beyond command-line args, and only outputs static strings. No external network calls, no data leaks, no suspicious code patterns. It appears to be a benign CLI utility for informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, benign CLI script that displays package info and version. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
