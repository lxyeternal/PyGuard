  "flows": "Command-line arguments are read from sys.argv; based on '--version', the code outputs version info or package info to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. No use of dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static informational text based on command-line input. It reads input from sys.argv and writes to stdout. There are no untrusted data processing, network activity, or sensitive data handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code appears to be a simple, benign script for informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign CLI utility that outputs static package information and version data. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or supply chain threats.",
