  "purpose": "Utilities to manage requirements files and call pip, including parsing requirements, locking dependencies, and retrieving installed packages.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements files, parsing requirement lines, calling subprocess to execute 'pip freeze' with specified site-packages directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; subprocess output is captured but not used maliciously; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input files -> parsing functions -> validation -> subprocess call to 'pip freeze' -> output processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard validation and subprocess usage. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dependency management tasks: reading requirements, parsing pinned versions, locking requirements via 'pip freeze', and handling requirements files. It uses only standard library modules, with controlled subprocess calls. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The print statements are for logging unsupported lines and do not pose security risks. The assertions and parsing logic are typical and do not introduce vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is a benign utility script for dependency management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility for managing Python dependencies with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
