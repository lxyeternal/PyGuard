  "purpose": "This script checks a specified third-party directory for missing wheels and source tarballs, reporting problems.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from command-line options: dest, wheels, sdists",
  "sinks": "The call to utils_thirdparty.find_problems which processes the directory and reports issues",
  "flows": "Command-line input (dest, options) -> check_thirdparty_dir() -> utils_thirdparty.find_problems()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily serves as a command-line interface to invoke a function from an imported utility module. It processes user input, validates the directory path, and passes options to the utility function. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious code execution, or malicious behavior. The code structure appears straightforward, with no obfuscated parts or suspicious constructs. The imported utils_thirdparty module is external and not provided, but the usage here is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a safe, utility-based script to check for missing package components in a directory. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware within this module. It appears to be a legitimate part of a package security or maintenance workflow.",
