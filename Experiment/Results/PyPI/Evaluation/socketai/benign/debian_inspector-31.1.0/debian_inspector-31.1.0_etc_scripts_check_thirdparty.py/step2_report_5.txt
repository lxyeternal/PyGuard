  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, logic, potential risks, and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the script is a straightforward CLI wrapper that calls an external utility function `utils_thirdparty.find_problems`.\n- The code is simple, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The external utility `utils_thirdparty` is not provided, so its internal behavior cannot be assessed, but the script itself appears benign.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- Security risk scores are low, mostly around 0.1–0.2, which is reasonable given the script's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious logic, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- The code simply parses CLI options and delegates to an external utility.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws are evident in the code.\n- The reports correctly identify that the core functionality depends on an external utility, which is a potential risk if compromised, but this is outside the scope of this script.\n- The `help` option is correctly added with `@click.help_option`.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correct.\n- **Security risk:** generally low (~0.1–0.2), which is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- The only potential concern is the external utility `utils_thirdparty.find_problems`. If that utility is malicious or compromised, it could pose a risk, but the script itself is benign.\n\n### Assumptions and claims:\n- All reports assume that the external utility is safe; without its code, this cannot be confirmed.\n- No reports claim any vulnerabilities based on assumptions; they all correctly identify the script as a simple CLI wrapper.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, I would assign the following scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1–0.2 |\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The script is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The minimal security risk is due to reliance on an external utility, which is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n- The malware score remains 0 because there's no indication of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper with no malicious behavior.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The risk scores are appropriate; no higher scores are justified without evidence of malicious external utilities.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores are reasonable; I would maintain them at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.1–0.2.",
