  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper that checks a specified thirdparty directory for problems by delegating to an external utility.",
  "sources": "Input directory path via --dest option, optional flags --wheels and --sdists.",
  "sinks": "The external utility function utils_thirdparty.find_problems() which processes the directory.",
  "flows": "CLI options are passed to the utility function, which performs the analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected within this script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward command-line interface that accepts a directory path and optional flags, then calls an external utility to perform checks. No internal network activity, data leakage, or malicious code is present. The external utility's trustworthiness is outside this code's scope, but the code itself is benign. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 and low security risk, consistent with the script's simple nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the external utility's trustworthiness should be verified separately. Overall, the script poses minimal security risk.",
