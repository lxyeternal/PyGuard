  "purpose": "A command-line utility to check a third-party directory for problems such as missing wheels or source tarballs.",
  "sources": "User provides the directory path via command-line options; the script reads command-line options and passes them to a utility function.",
  "sinks": "The utility function 'utils_thirdparty.find_problems' is called with user-supplied directory and flags, which could process or analyze files in that directory.",
  "flows": "User input (directory path and flags) -> command-line options -> function call to 'find_problems' with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Use of external utility is standard for such scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple command-line interface wrapper around a utility function that checks a directory for issues. It uses 'click' for argument parsing and passes user input to 'utils_thirdparty.find_problems'. There is no evidence of malicious code, code injection, or data exfiltration. The script appears legitimate and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The only concern could be if 'utils_thirdparty' is malicious or compromised, but based on this code alone, there is no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign CLI wrapper for checking third-party dependencies, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It simply forwards user input to an external utility for processing.",
