  "purpose": "A command-line utility to check a thirdparty directory for missing files and problems.",
  "sources": "Input path provided via command-line options (--dest).",
  "sinks": "Function call to utils_thirdparty.find_problems with parameters based on user options.",
  "flows": "User provides a directory path -> check_thirdparty_dir() calls utils_thirdparty.find_problems() with parameters -> processing occurs in the utility.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No dynamic code execution or suspicious operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily serves as a CLI wrapper around a utility function, with standard use of the 'click' library for argument parsing. No external data sources, network operations, or data leaks are present. The utils_thirdparty module's content is unknown, but the script itself does not exhibit malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The code structure is straightforward and typical for CLI tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI wrapper that facilitates directory checks. No signs of malicious behavior or malware are evident.",
