  "purpose": "Utilities to manage requirements files by generating or updating a requirements list based on installed packages in a specified site-packages directory.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for site-packages directory and requirements file path.",
  "sinks": "Calls external function utils_requirements.lock_requirements() with provided paths.",
  "flows": "User provides directory and filename -> arguments parsed -> function lock_requirements() invoked with these arguments.",
  "anomalies": "Minor inconsistency in argument naming: 'dest' is set as 'site-packages-dir' but accessed as 'site_packages_dir'; similarly, 'requirements-file' is used but the attribute is 'requirements_file'. These could cause runtime errors but are not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility script that parses arguments for a directory and file, then delegates processing to an external utility. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present within this snippet. The main concern is the external module 'utils_requirements', which could contain malicious code, but this cannot be assessed here. The code itself is safe, with only minor implementation issues related to argument attribute naming. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.1-0.2) due to reliance on external code. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for managing requirements files. The security posture depends on the external 'utils_requirements' module, but within this code snippet, no malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, with a low security risk (~0.1). Minor argument naming issues should be corrected for robustness.",
