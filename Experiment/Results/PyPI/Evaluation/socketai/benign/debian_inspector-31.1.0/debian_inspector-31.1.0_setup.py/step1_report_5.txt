  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "setuptools.setup() call, which is invoked during script execution.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the script does not process external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script simply calls a setup function.",
  "anomalies": "The script is minimal and standard; no anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic Python package setup script that imports setuptools and calls its setup() function when run as the main module. It contains no user input handling, no hardcoded credentials, and no network or system modifications. The structure is typical for a package setup script, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The absence of additional logic or external data handling suggests it is a straightforward, legitimate setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe to use.",
