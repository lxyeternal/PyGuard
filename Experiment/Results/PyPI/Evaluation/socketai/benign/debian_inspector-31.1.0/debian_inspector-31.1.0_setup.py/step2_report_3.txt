  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is a minimal setup script, with no malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n- The assessment is accurate; the code is benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also confirms the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious logic.\n- The conclusion is consistent with the code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to previous reports, confirms the code is a straightforward setup script.\n- No anomalies or malicious activity detected.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Describes the script as a standard package setup invocation, with no external input or malicious behavior.\n- The analysis is consistent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also describes a typical setup script with no suspicious behavior.\n- The conclusion aligns with the code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal, standard setup script.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, security risk:** All scores are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Logic and reasoning:** All reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's content.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, harmless setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
