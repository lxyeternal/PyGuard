  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for Python package distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The script imports the 'setuptools' module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the script does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Import of 'setuptools' followed by invocation of 'setuptools.setup()' within the main guard.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setuptools.setup()' within a '__main__' guard. It contains no external data sources, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The code is simple, clear, and adheres to common packaging conventions. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, boilerplate setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
