  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured package dependency fetcher with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The risk is minimal and primarily related to external repository trust, which is standard in such tools. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the nature of package management but no specific vulnerabilities in the code."
