  "purpose": "Generate and work with Python package compatibility tags based on system and interpreter info.",
  "sources": "Functions like interpreter_name(), interpreter_version(), and regex parsing of platform strings.",
  "sinks": "Returns lists of tags; no external data transmission or modification.",
  "flows": "Source functions provide system info, which is processed and returned as tags.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility for generating compatibility tags, involving platform string parsing, version handling, and list manipulations. It relies on external functions presumed safe, performs no malicious operations, and has no obfuscation. The regex and platform-specific logic are standard. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flow are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent utility for generating Python package compatibility tags, with no malicious intent or behavior. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
