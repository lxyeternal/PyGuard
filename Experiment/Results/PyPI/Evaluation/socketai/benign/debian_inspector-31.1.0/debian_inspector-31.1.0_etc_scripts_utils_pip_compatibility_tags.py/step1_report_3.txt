{
  "purpose": "The code generates and manipulates PEP 425 compatibility tags for Python packages, aiding in determining supported wheel formats across different platforms and Python versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, such as version, platforms, implementation, and ABI lists, as well as from imported modules and regex matches.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data flows include the output of get_supported() which returns a list of tags, but these are not used in any malicious way within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and internal function calls through processing functions, ultimately to the return statement providing support tags.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are observed. The code mostly performs standard parsing and platform-specific tag generation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward utility for generating compatibility tags based on platform and Python version data. It uses regex matching, platform-specific processing, and list manipulations to produce supported tags. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors are present. Functions are well-structured, with clear input/output, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The code adheres to typical utility pattern for package compatibility tagging.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate utility for handling Python package compatibility tags, with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It performs platform and version-based tag generation without any suspicious side effects.",
