  "purpose": "Generate a PyPI simple index from a directory of package files (wheels, sdists, etc.) and create HTML index files for package listings and links.",
  "sources": "Reads package files from the specified directory, reads file contents for checksum calculation, reads environment variables for file extensions, and receives input directory via command-line argument.",
  "sinks": "Creates and writes HTML files for indexes, symlinks package files, and reads file data for checksums.",
  "flows": "Scans directory -> filters package files -> extracts package info -> creates symlinks -> generates HTML indexes -> writes HTML files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected. The script generates static files and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily processes package files, generating HTML indexes for a PyPI-like repository. It uses regular expressions for filename parsing, computes SHA-256 checksums, and creates symlinks. It handles user input via command line argument and filesystem interactions, but all actions are consistent with index generation. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. Usage of hashlib, os, re, shutil, and pathlib are standard and safe. The code does not include any malicious logic, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a static index generator for Python packages, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It follows standard practices for file handling and HTML generation, with no hidden or harmful functionality.",
