{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to validate whether platform tags for Python wheel files are supported on PyPI, primarily used for platform compatibility checking.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the function parameter 'platforms' in 'validate_platforms_for_pypi' and the 'platform_tag' argument in 'is_supported_platform_tag'.",
  "sinks": "Returns a list of unsupported platform tags; no data leakage or sensitive data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Input 'platforms' -> 'validate_platforms_for_pypi' -> checks each platform with 'is_supported_platform_tag' -> outputs invalid tags.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code uses static data and regex matching for validation without obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 're' for regex operations and defines static sets for supported platforms. It contains regex patterns to identify macOS and manylinux platform tags, validating them against known supported versions. Functions operate solely to validate input platform tags, returning validation results without executing external commands or handling sensitive data. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code appears standard and straightforward for platform validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs platform tag validation with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It relies on static data and regex matching, serving a legitimate purpose of platform compatibility checking for Python wheel files. No malware or security risks are identified.",
