  "purpose": "Importing modules and classes related to dictionary data structures and DAWG (Directed Acyclic Word Graph) implementations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.wrapper and .dawgs). No external input reading identified.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, importing specific classes and functions from local modules. No execution, data processing, or external interactions are present. The use of relative imports and the nature of imported classes suggest modular design but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an import module for DAWG data structures and related utilities. No malicious or security concerns are evident based on the provided snippet.",
