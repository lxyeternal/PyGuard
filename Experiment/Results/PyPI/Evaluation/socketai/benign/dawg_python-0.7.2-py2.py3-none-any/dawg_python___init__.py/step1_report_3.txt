  "purpose": "Importing classes and functions related to Dictionary and DAWG data structures, likely for use in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the current package/module and its submodules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data outputs or external data handling present in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flow identified within this small snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing specific classes from local modules. It uses a standard import pattern without any dynamic execution, code obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The use of 'absolute_import' from __future__ indicates compatibility considerations, not malicious intent. No external network communication, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple set of import statements, serving as a part of a larger module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on this snippet.",
