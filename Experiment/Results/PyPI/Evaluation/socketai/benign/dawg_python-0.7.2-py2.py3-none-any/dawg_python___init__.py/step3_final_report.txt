{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes from local modules, serving as an interface or initialization script within a package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.wrapper' and '.dawgs' modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, with no dynamic execution, external input/output, or network activity. The import statements are standard for module setup. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. Since the code does not perform any operations beyond static imports, the risk and malware scores remain at zero. The analysis confirms that the code is safe and does not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks based on this snippet. The import statements are standard and do not indicate any malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores assigned are accurate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
