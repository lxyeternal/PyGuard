{
  "purpose": "Define and manipulate properties of a dictionary unit, such as checking for leaf status, extracting values, labels, and offsets.",
  "sources": "Constants and function parameters (e.g., base, _mask). No external data input or untrusted data sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The functions perform bitwise operations on the 'base' value to extract specific bits or fields. No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The code is straightforward bitwise manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and functions to interpret a 32-bit 'unit' value. Functions check for specific flags (like leaf presence), extract a value or label, and compute offsets based on bitwise operations. The operations are standard for bitfield parsing, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The code does not interact with external data sources or perform network or file operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal utility for handling a structured data format, with no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks identified. It solely performs safe bitwise operations on internal constants and parameters.",
