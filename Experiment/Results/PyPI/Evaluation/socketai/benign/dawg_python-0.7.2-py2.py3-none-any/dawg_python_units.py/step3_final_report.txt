  "purpose": "Utility functions for interpreting bit-packed data units within a 32-bit integer, likely used in spatial indices or trie structures.",
  "sources": "The functions read the 'base' integer parameter, which is passed directly to each function; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; the functions only perform internal bitwise operations.",
  "flows": "Input 'base' flows through functions where specific bits are extracted or checked, with no external untrusted data flow or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for bit masks and four functions that perform simple bitwise operations to interpret flags, labels, values, and offsets within a 32-bit integer. Static analysis shows no malicious behavior, no external data interactions, and no obfuscation. The functions are deterministic and standard for compact data parsing. All reports agree on the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero, with high confidence. The logic is correct, and no vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for interpreting bit-packed data units. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
