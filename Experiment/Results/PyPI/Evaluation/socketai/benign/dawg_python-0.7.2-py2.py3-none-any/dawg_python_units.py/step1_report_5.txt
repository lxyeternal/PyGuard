{
  "purpose": "Defines functions to interpret and manipulate data units in a dictionary structure, likely for spatial or hierarchical data.",
  "sources": "Constants and bitwise operations reading from the 'base' parameter in functions such as has_leaf, value, label, and offset.",
  "sinks": "Bitwise operations and return statements that process 'base' values; no external or untrusted data inputs or outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'base' values are read in various functions and processed via bitwise operations; no flow from external untrusted sources to sinks is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "Code performs straightforward bitwise checks and shifts without obfuscation, secrets, or unusual code constructs; no suspicious or malicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions to extract information from data units using bitwise operations. It uses constants for bit masks and shifts. There are no external data inputs, no network or I/O operations, no code injection, and no encryption or decryption routines. The functions are simple and serve a data parsing purpose, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a safe utility module for interpreting data units, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is straightforward and maintains a clear purpose.",
