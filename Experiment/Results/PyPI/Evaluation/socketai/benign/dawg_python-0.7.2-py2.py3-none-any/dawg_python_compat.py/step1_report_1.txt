  "purpose": "Define a function to convert a byte to an integer, compatible with Python 2 and Python 3.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info to determine Python version",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "Conditional logic based on Python version to assign int_from_byte",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version check and function assignment",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version to define 'int_from_byte' appropriately. In Python 3, it returns the byte directly; in Python 2, it uses 'ord' to convert a byte to an integer. There is no suspicious or malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or backdoors. The code is simple and standard for cross-version compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version compatibility utility with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
