  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> int_from_byte function behavior based on Python version",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version check and function definition",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python version to define a function int_from_byte. In Python 3, it assumes the input byte is already an integer and returns it directly. In Python 2, it uses ord() to convert a byte (string of length 1) to its integer representation. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The logic is standard for compatibility between Python versions and does not perform any data manipulation or external communication.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a simple version compatibility shim for byte-to-integer conversion. It contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and appears to be a benign utility function. No malware or security concerns are identified.",
