  "purpose": "Provides a cross-version compatibility utility for converting a byte to an integer in Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info[0] == 3 to determine Python version; the function int_from_byte depending on version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "Version check source leads to defining int_from_byte either as identity or as ord function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code present; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple Python version check to define a utility function for byte-to-int conversion, a common compatibility pattern. It does not process untrusted data, communicate externally, or contain any malicious or obfuscated logic. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The logic is standard, and the scores are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All assessments are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
