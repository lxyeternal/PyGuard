  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code defines two custom exception classes (`Error` and `LogicError`) inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - The code is static, with no dynamic execution, input/output, or external dependencies.\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition for exceptions.\n   - No logical errors, security flaws, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The documentation references are appropriate, and the code adheres to Python conventions.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`, which is reasonable.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports and the code itself show no malicious behavior, the risk scores are correctly low (0).\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or handle sensitive data.\n   - Therefore, no justification exists for higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on factual observations; no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made.\n   - The reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My Own Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final Justification:**\nThe code is purely for defining exceptions, with no suspicious or malicious features. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk scores.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
