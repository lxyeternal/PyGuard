  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code defines two custom exception classes, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception.\n   - The reports confirm that the code is static, straightforward, and contains no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n   - No external inputs, data flows, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - **Conclusion:** There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent, detailed, and accurately describe the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is standard and safe.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all 0, aligning with the conclusion that the code is benign.\n   - No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0.\n   - This matches the code's nature; no malicious activity detected.\n   - Correctly reflected.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are thorough and accurate, and their scoring reflects this.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further adjustments needed.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus in the reports.",
