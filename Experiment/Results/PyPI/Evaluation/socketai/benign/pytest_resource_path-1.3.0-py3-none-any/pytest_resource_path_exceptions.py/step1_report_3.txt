  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the package, specifically Error and LogicError.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading occurs in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways exist in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definitions with no unusual constructs or secretive behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two custom exception class definitions inheriting from Exception. It includes a module docstring and an __all__ declaration. There are no external data inputs, no suspicious function calls, no obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. The classes serve a standard purpose of defining error types, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, safe, and standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security issues.",
