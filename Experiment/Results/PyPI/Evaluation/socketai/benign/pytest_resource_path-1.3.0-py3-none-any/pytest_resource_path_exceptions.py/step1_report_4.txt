  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the package.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; code is purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a module for custom exceptions with two classes: Error and LogicError, inheriting from Python's Exception. The classes contain docstrings and simple inheritance structures. No dynamic code execution, external data input, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices for custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of custom exception classes for a package. No security risks or malicious behaviors are detected.",
