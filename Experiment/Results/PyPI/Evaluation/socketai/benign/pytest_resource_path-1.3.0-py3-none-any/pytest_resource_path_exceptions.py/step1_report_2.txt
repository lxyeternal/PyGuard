  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use within a Python package.",
  "sources": "None (no input or external data reading occurs in this code).",
  "sinks": "None (no data outputs, network calls, or sensitive operations).",
  "flows": "Not applicable (no data flow from sources to sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Code only defines exception classes with no suspicious logic or hidden behavior. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code creates two custom exception classes, Error and LogicError, both inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. The classes are straightforward and contain only docstrings. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, or any suspicious patterns. The purpose appears to be standard exception handling structure for a package. No anomalies, no suspicious logic, and no malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign definition of custom exceptions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves a typical purpose in a Python package without any suspicious activity.",
