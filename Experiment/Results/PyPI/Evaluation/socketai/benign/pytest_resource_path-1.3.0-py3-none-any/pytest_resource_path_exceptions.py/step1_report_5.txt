{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for this package, specifically Error and LogicError.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions for custom exceptions. It uses standard Python exception inheritance without any dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious logic. The docstrings provide documentation but do not indicate malicious intent. The module's scope is limited to exception class declarations, which are safe and typical in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and intended for use as part of a larger package.",
