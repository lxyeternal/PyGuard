  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only defines two custom exception classes (`Error` and `LogicError`) inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - No dynamic code, input handling, network operations, or other potentially malicious behaviors are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, static, and serves a typical purpose in error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence score is 1, which seems reasonable since the analysis is thorough and consistent.\n   - No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree on zero malware and security risk, and the code is simple class definitions, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could compromise security or be malicious.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the code's benign nature.\n   - No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are based on straightforward static analysis without assumptions of hidden behaviors.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analyses.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Estimated Malware Score:** 0 (confirmed benign)\n- **Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Estimated Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe, and benign implementation of custom exception classes. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code poses no security risk.\n- The malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0.\n- The risk score should also be 0.\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is harmless and serves a typical purpose in a Python package.",
