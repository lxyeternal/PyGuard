  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is simply defining two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception.\n   - The code is static, with no dynamic behavior, input/output operations, or external dependencies.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and has no malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious behavior, no vulnerabilities, and no obfuscation, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - A high malware score (0) and security risk score (0) are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code is purely class definitions for error handling, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on static analysis and are consistent with the code provided.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about hidden behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the reports' conclusions.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward, benign implementation of custom exception classes.\n- The malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores should all remain at 0.\n- The confidence score of 1 is justified given the clear, static, and safe nature of the code.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
