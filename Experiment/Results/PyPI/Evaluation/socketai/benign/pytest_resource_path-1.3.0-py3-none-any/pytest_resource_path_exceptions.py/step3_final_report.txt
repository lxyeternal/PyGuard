  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling within the package.",
  "sources": "No external input; static class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static class definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, network operations, or external dependencies. The code is static, clear, and serves a typical purpose in error management. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to Python conventions confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. The analysis and reports are consistent, and the scores accurately reflect the code's harmlessness.",
