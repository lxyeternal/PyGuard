  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the package to handle errors and logic errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; exception classes are defined statically.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling operations; no data leak or effect points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code is purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class inheritance without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. It includes a docstring referencing Python error handling documentation. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or network operations are present. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are detected. The structure is standard and intended for error handling within a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard, benign definition of custom exception classes with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
