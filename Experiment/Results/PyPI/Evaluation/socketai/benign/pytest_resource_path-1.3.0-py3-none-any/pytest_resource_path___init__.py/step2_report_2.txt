  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily performing import and re-export operations.\n- The use of wildcard imports ('import *') is consistently flagged as a concern, mainly for code clarity and potential concealment of malicious code.\n- No evidence of data flows from untrusted sources, data sinks, or malicious activity such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward module aggregator for pytest resource path utilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The actual code snippet matches the descriptions: it imports from multiple modules using wildcard imports and consolidates their `__all__` attributes into the module's `__all__`.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads, is present.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which is discouraged because it can hide imported symbols and make code behavior less explicit.\n- There are no security flaws or malicious behaviors evident in the code itself.\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (0 or 0.2), since the code is simple and does not handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The main concern is the use of wildcard imports, which could potentially hide malicious code if the imported modules were compromised. However, given the context (importing from a known open-source package), this risk is minimal but worth noting as a best practice violation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (low, mainly due to wildcard imports, but no actual threat)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign module for re-exporting components from the `pytest_resource_path` package. While the use of wildcard imports is discouraged, it does not constitute malicious behavior. No security threats or malware are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe and standard for module aggregation.  \n- No changes needed to the reported scores; they are appropriate.  \n- The primary recommendation is to replace wildcard imports with explicit imports for better clarity and maintainability, but this does not impact security.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, due to import style)",
