{
  "purpose": "The code re-exports components from the 'pytest_resource_path' package modules to facilitate their use in tests.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pytest_resource_path' modules: absolute_path_factory, exceptions, path_factory, path_to_resource_factory, pytest_resource_path.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data processing or output functions observed.",
  "flows": "Imports from package modules and re-exports via __all__; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') which can hide imported symbols and obscure code understanding; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package imports and consolidates exports via __all__. The use of 'import *' from multiple modules could potentially hide malicious code if present within those modules, but on their own, these statements are standard for package re-exporting. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows indicating malicious activity. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. Overall, the code appears to serve as a straightforward interface for the 'pytest_resource_path' package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package re-export module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. Its use of wildcard imports is a concern for code clarity but does not imply malicious intent. No malware or security threats are evident from this snippet.",
