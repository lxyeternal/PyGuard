  "purpose": "Re-export modules from pytest_resource_path for simplified access in testing contexts.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest_resource_path modules using wildcard imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "Wildcard imports bring all symbols from modules into current namespace; then __all__ is aggregated.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure symbol origins; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules via wildcard imports, then consolidates their __all__ attributes into its own __all__. No data flows from untrusted sources, no network or file operations, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide symbols and potentially conceal malicious code if present in the imported modules. All reports agree that the code is benign, with malware scores of 0 and low security risk (~0.1-0.2), mainly due to coding style rather than actual threats. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module for re-exporting components with no signs of malicious activity. The main issue is the use of wildcard imports, which should be replaced with explicit imports for clarity and best practices, but this does not indicate malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
