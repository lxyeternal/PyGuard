  "purpose": "Provides a factory for constructing paths to test resources based on test file locations and configurable directory names.",
  "sources": "Path inputs from external classes (`AbsolutePathFactory`, `PathFactory`) and method parameters such as `path_tests`, `path_test_resources`, and method/function objects.",
  "sinks": "Path concatenations and file name manipulations; no external system calls or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Path objects are created from external factory methods, then combined with default directory names and file names derived from method/function objects.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in class attribute name: `DIRECTORY_NAME_TESTS_DEAFAULT` instead of `DEFAULT`. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward path factory utility for test resources, relying on external classes presumed benign. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The only notable issue is a typo in the class attribute name, which does not impact security but should be corrected for clarity. The path manipulations are standard and do not involve untrusted input handling or external system interactions. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are appropriate. Confidence in benign assessment is high (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for managing test resource paths with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only correction needed is fixing the typo in the class attribute name.",
