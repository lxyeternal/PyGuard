  "purpose": "Module extension, version checking, dynamic assembly loading, and publishing setup for AWS CDK package.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version retrieval, assembly load, and publication call.",
  "sinks": "publication.publish() potentially transmitting data, assembly load for dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Version check -> assembly load -> publication.publish()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks; standard AWS CDK patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks, including extending module path, importing dependencies, retrieving version info, performing version-dependent type checks, dynamically loading a JSII assembly, and publishing metadata. No malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The publication call could transmit data but is typical in package workflows. No suspicious network activity or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for AWS CDK modules, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The publication call is a normal part of package distribution, not inherently malicious. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
