  "purpose": "Configure package setup for 'aws-cdk.region-info' Python package using metadata loaded from a JSON string and a README file.",
  "sources": "JSON string defining package metadata, and reading 'README.md' for long_description.",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup(**kwargs) which uses the assembled metadata for package installation.",
  "flows": "JSON data -> kwargs dictionary -> reading README.md -> setuptools.setup call",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. Use of JSON parsing and file reading are standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code loads package metadata from a static JSON string, then reads a README file to include as the long description. It then calls setuptools.setup with the prepared kwargs. All operations are standard for Python package setup, with no dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a normal package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply loads predefined metadata and reads a README file for documentation. No anomalies or malware are detected.",
