  "purpose": "Load static package metadata from a JSON string, read README.md for long description, and invoke setuptools.setup() to configure the Python package.",
  "sources": "json.loads() parsing the JSON string, open() reading README.md file",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() function call",
  "flows": "json.loads() provides metadata to setup(), open() supplies long_description, both flow into setup()",
  "anomalies": "None detected; static data and standard file reading operations",
  "analysis": "The code loads package metadata from a hardcoded JSON string, reads a local README.md file for the long description, and calls setuptools.setup() with this data. There are no dynamic inputs, network activity, or untrusted data handling. The JSON data is static and well-formed. Reading README.md is a common practice for package descriptions. No obfuscated code, secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to standard Python packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign setup configuration for a Python package. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
