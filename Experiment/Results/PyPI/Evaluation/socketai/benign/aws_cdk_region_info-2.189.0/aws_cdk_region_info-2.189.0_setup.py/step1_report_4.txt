  "purpose": "Configure and set up the Python package 'aws-cdk.region-info' with metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "JSON string containing package metadata, open file 'README.md' for long description",
  "sinks": "Reading 'README.md' content; passing metadata to setuptools.setup()",
  "flows": "json.loads() parsing metadata -> reading 'README.md' -> setup() process",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious activities detected. Use of open 'README.md' file reading could potentially be exploited if the file contains malicious content, but as part of setup, this is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code loads package metadata from a JSON string, then reads a README.md file to include as long_description, and finally calls setuptools.setup() with the collected data. The JSON contains only static, harmless package information. The file reading operation is straightforward and safe, provided 'README.md' is a normal markdown file. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data flow. No external or untrusted data sources or sinks that could lead to data leaks or system compromise are present. The code appears to be standard package setup logic.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard package setup operations with static data and safe file reading. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected.",
