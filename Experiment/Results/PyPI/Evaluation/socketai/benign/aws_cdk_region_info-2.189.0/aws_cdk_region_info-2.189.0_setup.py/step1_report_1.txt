  "purpose": "To load package metadata from a JSON string and use setuptools to set up a Python package.",
  "sources": "json.loads() parsing the JSON string; open() reading the README.md file",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() function call",
  "flows": "json.loads() parses JSON data, then open() reads file content into the dictionary, then setup() is called with the data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. The JSON string is static, and the file read appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code loads package configuration from a static JSON string, which is well-formed and contains package metadata. It then reads a README.md file to assign a long description. The setup() function is invoked with these parameters. No untrusted input is processed; no dynamic code execution, network access, or hidden behaviors are present. The code appears typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard package setup operations with static data. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or security risks.",
