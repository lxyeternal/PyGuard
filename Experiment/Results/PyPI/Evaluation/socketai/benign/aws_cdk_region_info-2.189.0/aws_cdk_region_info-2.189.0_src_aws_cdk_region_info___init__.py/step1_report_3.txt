{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface and utility functions for accessing and managing AWS regional information, such as endpoints, account IDs, and facts related to AWS regions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class properties, method parameters, and the internal jsii object properties, particularly for region facts, configurations, and static data.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks include returning string values for AWS resource ARNs, account IDs, URLs, and other region-specific information. These are mostly static or derived from internal data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class methods and properties (sources) to return specific regional facts or ARNs, often passing parameters like version, architecture, or service name, with no evidence of untrusted external input influencing the outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code employs standard patterns for configuration and data retrieval, with no signs of obfuscation, suspicious dynamic execution, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions, static properties, classmethods for data lookup, and proxy implementations for interfacing with jsii objects. It provides structured access to AWS regional data, including facts like endpoints, account IDs, and ARNs. There are deprecated methods for service principals, but these are documented as such. No input handling, user data processing, or network communication is present, reducing the risk of malicious data flows or injections. The code appears to be a standard SDK interface for regional AWS data with no malicious behavior or sabotage evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard part of AWS CDK's regional information management, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs static data lookups and provides interface definitions for AWS region-specific facts. No malware signals or security risks are present.",
