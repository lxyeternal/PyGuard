{
  "purpose": "The code provides a library for accessing AWS regional information and facts, including mechanisms for registering, overriding, and retrieving facts about AWS regions and services.",
  "sources": "Reads input data primarily from static class methods, property getters, and predefined constants. No external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "Uses internal method calls and property accessors; no sinks that handle untrusted input or lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Flow involves internal method calls to retrieve region info or facts; no untrusted data flow paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "Contains deprecated methods and properties, but no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic execution patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are visible. The code adheres to standard design patterns for SDKs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK module defining classes, properties, and methods for region data management. It uses static data and method calls, with no dynamic code execution, external input handling, or obfuscated constructs. The presence of deprecation warnings indicates evolution of the library but does not imply malicious intent. Typechecking stubs are used for validation but do not pose security risks. No signals of sabotage, privacy violations, or malware are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of the AWS CDK SDK for regional information management. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The overall security risk is negligible.",
