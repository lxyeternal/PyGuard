{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for Skein-related errors and provides a context manager for handling warning messages and exception wrapping, supporting CLI and non-CLI modes.",
  "sources": "None (no external input sources); the code primarily defines classes and methods without data input handling.",
  "sinks": "None (no data sinks or output functions that process untrusted data).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The code uses standard exception handling and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes for a specific application context (Skein) and includes a context manager class '_Context' that manages warning outputs and dynamically wraps common exceptions with additional behavior based on CLI mode. The register_wrapper method dynamically creates wrapper classes for standard exceptions and attaches them to the '_Context' class, depending on CLI state. All code appears to serve legitimate exception handling and messaging purposes without malicious behavior. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for custom exception handling and message management. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. It appears safe and intended solely for managing errors and warnings within the Skein application context.",
