{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Skein-related errors and provide a context manager for warning/output handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only through standard exceptions, class initialization, and method calls. No external input sources or data reading from untrusted sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Warning messages are printed to stderr or issued via warnings.warn, which are generally safe. No data is written to network, files, or external systems.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input leading to potential vulnerabilities; exception handling and warnings are internal.",
  "anomalies": "The register_wrapper class dynamically creates new exception types based on existing ones, which is normal for exception hierarchies. No suspicious or obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines custom exceptions and manages warning output via a context manager. The dynamic class creation within register_wrapper is a standard pattern for wrapping exceptions differently depending on context. No input reading, data processing, or external data flow is evident. The exception hierarchy is straightforward. The warning system adjusts output based on a CLI flag. No signs of malware or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign utility for exception handling and warning management with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is safe and intended for internal application error management.",
