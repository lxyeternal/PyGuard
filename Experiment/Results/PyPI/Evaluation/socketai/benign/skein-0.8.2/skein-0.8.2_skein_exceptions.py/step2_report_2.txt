  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The code defines custom exceptions and a context class for warning/error handling, with no malicious or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is straightforward, with dynamic class creation for exception wrapping being a controlled pattern. No external input or malicious behavior is present.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 seem reasonable given the benign nature, though the risk score might be slightly conservative; perhaps up to 0.2, but not higher.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that untrusted 'msg' inputs are limited to error/warning messages, with no dangerous data flow.  \n- **Assessment:** The code is benign; untrusted 'msg' could be misused in logs, but this is standard. No malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are appropriate.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is standard exception handling, with no external data flow or malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is straightforward, with dynamic class creation for wrapping exceptions being a common pattern.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 are justified.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Reiterates the benign nature, with no suspicious code patterns or external data handling.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid. The code is safe and serves a clear purpose.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 are appropriate.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing that the code is a structured exception framework with no malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 are justified.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code contains no malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, but generally very low (0.1-0.2). Given the code's benign nature, I would assign a **risk score of 0.1** to reflect minimal concern, primarily due to dynamic class creation, which is controlled and not malicious.  \n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1**  \n\nThe code appears to be a standard utility module for exception handling and warning management, with no security risks or malicious behavior.",
