{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Skein-related errors and provide a context manager for handling warnings and error wrapping, with CLI mode support.",
  "sources": "Input sources are minimal, primarily via standard error and exception instantiation within the code.",
  "sinks": "Warnings output to stderr, exception creation potentially affecting error handling.",
  "flows": "No significant data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; exception wrapping is internal.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code; use of dynamic class creation for wrapping exceptions is standard and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes and a context class for managing CLI output and wrapping common Python exceptions. The 'warn' method conditionally outputs warnings to stderr based on 'is_cli' state. The 'register_wrapper' class method dynamically creates subclasses of exceptions with different behavior depending on CLI mode, but this is a controlled pattern for error handling. No data input, external network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The code is straightforward and standard for error management, with no signs of malicious payloads or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign utility module for exception handling and warning management. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations. The dynamic class wrapping is a typical pattern for flexible error handling and does not introduce security risks.",
