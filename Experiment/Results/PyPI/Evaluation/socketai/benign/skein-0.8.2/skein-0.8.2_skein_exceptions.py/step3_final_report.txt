{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and a context manager for handling warnings and exception wrapping, primarily for error management in Skein-related applications.",
  "sources": "The 'warn' method uses the 'msg' parameter for warning messages; the 'register_wrapper' class method creates new exception classes dynamically based on existing exception types.",
  "sinks": "The 'msg' parameter in 'warn' and 'wrap' methods could potentially contain untrusted input if misused externally, but within this code, it is used solely for messaging.",
  "flows": "The 'set_cli' context manager temporarily sets 'is_cli' to True, affecting how exceptions are wrapped; 'warn' outputs messages to stderr or warnings.warn depending on 'is_cli'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The dynamic class creation is controlled and standard for exception wrapping.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for exception handling and warning management. It defines exception classes, a context class with methods for warning output, and dynamically creates wrapper classes for standard exceptions. No external data input, network activity, or malicious code is present. The use of 'msg' in warnings and exception messages is standard; potential misuse of 'msg' is a general concern but not a security issue here. The dynamic class creation pattern is controlled and common. Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for error and warning handling, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
