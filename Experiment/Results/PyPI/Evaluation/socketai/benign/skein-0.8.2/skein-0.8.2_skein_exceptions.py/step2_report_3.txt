  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines custom exceptions and a context class for warning/error handling with CLI support. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the potential misuse of 'msg' in warnings but not a security concern.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard, with no malicious intent. The slight security risk score is reasonable, considering that untrusted 'msg' could be misused in logs, but no actual vulnerability exists.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the lack of external input, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. Notes that 'msg' can contain untrusted data but isn't exploited maliciously.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher but still low; justified due to potential for misleading messages if 'msg' is untrusted.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No signs of malware or backdoors. The potential for misuse of 'msg' is acknowledged but not a security issue.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the benign nature, standard exception class definitions, and safe warning handling. No external data flow or malicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — aligns with the benign analysis.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as safe and straightforward.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar conclusions—standard exception handling, dynamic class creation for wrapping exceptions, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid; no security concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is a structured exception and warning framework, with no suspicious or malicious patterns. Dynamic class creation is standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions—no network activity, no obfuscated code, no backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but all are very low (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's purpose and the lack of external data or system modifications, these are reasonable.\n\n### **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and understandable.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — a minimal security risk due to potential misuse of 'msg' in logs, but not a real vulnerability.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign utility module for exception handling and warning management, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and does not contain malicious payloads.\n- The low risk scores are justified.\n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** Confirm the scores as they are, with malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and risk = 0.1.",
