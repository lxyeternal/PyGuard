{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Skein-related errors and provide context-aware warning and error handling mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Initialization of exception classes, the _Context class with warn and set_cli methods, and dynamic registration of exception wrappers.",
  "sinks": "Warnings and print statements, exception instantiations, dynamic class creation via type().",
  "flows": "Exception wrapper methods generate and raise exceptions based on context; warnings are issued via warnings.warn or print depending on is_cli flag.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activities. Dynamic class creation is used, but for standard exception wrapping, not obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes for a Skein application, with a context class that manages whether warnings are printed directly or issued as warnings. The _Context class includes a method to register exception wrappers dynamically for standard exceptions and some built-in errors. The register_wrapper method creates new exception types dynamically, extending the base exception classes, and provides a wrap method to instantiate these exceptions based on the context. The use of dynamic class creation and context management appears to serve straightforward exception handling purposes, not malicious activity. No external data is read or written, no network connections, or system modifications are observed. The code is structurally clear, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a structured exception handling framework with context-sensitive warning and error reporting. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The dynamic class creation is a standard pattern for wrapping exceptions and does not pose a security threat.",
