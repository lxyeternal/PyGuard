  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes build commands for protobuf and Java, relying on filesystem, package resources, and subprocess calls.\n- **Sinks:** External command execution via grpc_tools and Maven, file operations.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious data flows; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard build script; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 (low), Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are reasonable. The low risk score aligns with the absence of suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup script, handling protobuf and Java build steps.\n- **Sinks:** External commands (mvn, protoc), file operations.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No untrusted input into subprocess calls; no secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate build orchestration; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scores; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; manages build steps.\n- **Sinks:** External commands, file manipulations.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate build script.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar build orchestration, invoking external tools.\n- **Sinks:** External commands, file operations.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No malicious patterns or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard build process.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, managing protobuf and Java build steps.\n- **Sinks:** External commands, file manipulations.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity; no obfuscation or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate build utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior—no network activity, no obfuscated code, no secrets.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0; the code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the reliance on external build tools like Maven and grpc_tools, which are standard for such build scripts.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is justified.\n- **Risk:** Given the external command executions, a small risk score (~0.2) is appropriate, especially considering potential environment issues, but nothing suspicious in the code itself.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code appears to be a standard, legitimate build script with no malicious intent. The scores reflect the low risk and absence of obfuscation or malware.",
