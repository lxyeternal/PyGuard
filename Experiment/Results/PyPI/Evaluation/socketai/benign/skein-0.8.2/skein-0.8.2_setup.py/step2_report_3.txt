  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code manages build commands for protobuf and Java artifacts, invoking external tools (grpc_tools.protoc, Maven). It reads source files, generates artifacts, and cleans build directories.\n- **Findings:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. Uses subprocess calls safely, with no suspicious data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score aligns with the straightforward build process. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes build setup for protobuf and Java, invoking Maven and grpc_tools. No suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Uses subprocess calls with fixed commands.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is appropriate; the process is standard and safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a build setup script for protobuf and Java, with subprocess calls and file manipulations.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. Uses subprocess safely.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The score matches the observed behavior; no concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar build orchestration with external tools and file operations.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation. Uses subprocess calls in a typical manner.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate scoring; no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern: build commands for protobuf and Java, invoking external tools.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with other reports; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Judgment:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None of the reports identify or find any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports confirm the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated logic.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** The risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), which is reasonable given the build nature of the code and the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code merely orchestrates build processes and calls external tools; no malicious payloads are present.\n- **External Commands:** The use of subprocess for Maven and grpc_tools is standard for such build scripts and does not inherently pose security risks unless the environment is compromised, which is outside the scope of this code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are accurate.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at **0**, **0**, and **0.2** respectively, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n\nThe code is a typical build setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
