  "purpose": "Import statements to include modules and classes necessary for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (. , .core, .exceptions, .model, ._version).",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sources or sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs imports and version retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "Use of get_versions() from a version module, then deleting the function; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several internal modules and classes, retrieves a version string via get_versions(), and then deletes the function reference. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of untrusted data is present. The pattern is typical for Python packages to manage module imports and versioning. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for a Python package's __init__.py or similar module, aimed at setting up namespace and versioning. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
