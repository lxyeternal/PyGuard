  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code is standard import statements and version retrieval, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  None. The reasoning is sound; the code is typical for a package's `__init__.py`.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  Risk: 0 — justified, as no security concern.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. Same reasoning applies; straightforward imports and version retrieval.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  None detected.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. Again, only import statements and version assignment.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  None.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  Risk: 0 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. Same pattern: import statements and version info.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  None.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  Risk: 0 — justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code again is only module imports and version retrieval.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  None.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  Risk: 0.1 — perhaps slightly higher, but still very low, and the reasoning justifies a minimal risk score.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code is standard import/setup code with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware scores:** All are appropriately set to 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Correctly 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All are at 0 or very close to 0, justified by the absence of security concerns.\n\n### Final expert estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious intent or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risk present.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. The code is typical package initialization code, with no indicators of supply chain threats, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
