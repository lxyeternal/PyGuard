{
  "purpose": "Import statements for various modules and components within a package, setting the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (. , .core, .exceptions, .model, ._version), and a function call to get version info.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data being written to external systems or untrusted sources handled here.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only performs imports and a version assignment; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The version info is dynamically retrieved but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules and a call to get the package version, which is then assigned to __version__. There are no functions, data processing, external data input, or network activity. The imports appear to organize internal components. The version retrieval is standard practice for packaging and does not involve any suspicious behavior or malicious code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, performing only internal imports and version assignment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscation. Overall, it appears to be standard package initialization code.",
