  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence provided, the logic, and the scoring justification.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely import statements and version retrieval, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n- **Conclusion:** Fully aligned; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward imports and version assignment.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—imports and version info, no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Standard package init code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — matches the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar import and version retrieval pattern, with a very slight mention of a `securityRisk` score of 0.1.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.1.\n- **Justification:** Given the code's simplicity, a security risk score of 0.1 seems unwarranted. No evidence of vulnerability or malicious activity is presented.\n- **Recommendation:** The securityRisk score should be 0, aligning with the rest of the reports and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, as expected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** All zero, as no security concerns are evident.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The only inconsistency is in report 5's `securityRisk` score of 0.1, which should be lowered to 0.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate across all reports.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks present.\n\n**Summary:** The code is standard package setup code, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and no security risks. The only correction needed is to adjust report 5's `securityRisk` score from 0.1 to 0.",
