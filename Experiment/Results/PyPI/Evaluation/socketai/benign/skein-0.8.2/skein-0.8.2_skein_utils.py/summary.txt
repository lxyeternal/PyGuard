  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign utility functions with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to environment variable handling and process checks, which are standard in system utilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting cautious but justified assessment."
