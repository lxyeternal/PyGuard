  "purpose": "Utility functions for file locking, process management, environment control, data formatting, and time calculations.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, opening files for locking, checking process existence via os.kill, reading version info.",
  "sinks": "Modifying environment variables, opening files, calling os.kill, decoding bytes, formatting strings.",
  "flows": "Environment variable modifications in grpc_fork_support_disabled() -> process existence check in pid_exists -> file operations in lock_file and _FileLock methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated distutils.version.LooseVersion, environment variable toggling for gRPC fork support, standard process checks, no obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard system utility functions, including file locking, process existence checks, environment variable management, and data formatting. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The environment variable manipulation in grpc_fork_support_disabled() is a controlled workaround for gRPC fork support issues. The process check via os.kill is standard. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses common practices. No suspicious data flows or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign utility functions with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to environment variable handling and process checks, which are standard in system utilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting cautious but justified assessment.",
