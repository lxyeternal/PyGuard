  "purpose": "CLI for managing Skein applications, containers, key-value store, driver, and security credentials.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, environment variables, stdin, configuration files.",
  "sinks": "stdout, stderr, network SDK calls for application management and communication.",
  "flows": "User inputs via CLI arguments flow into SDK method calls; outputs are printed or written to stdout/stderr; network interactions occur through SDK classes like Client and ApplicationClient.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious code, or backdoors detected. Credential generation via 'Security.new_credentials()' is standard and legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a CLI wrapper around SDK classes for application and resource management. It handles user inputs securely, performs standard operations, and does not include obfuscated or malicious code. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are evident. The security credentials are generated through a legitimate method, not hardcoded or malicious. The overall structure and behavior align with expected management tools, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured CLI utility for Skein application management. It contains no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified by its standard credential handling and management functions. The malware score remains 0, consistent with the analysis.",
