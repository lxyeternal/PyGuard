{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to provide version information by parsing a JSON string that contains metadata about the software version.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded JSON string assigned to the variable 'version_json'.",
  "sinks": "The code uses 'json.loads' to parse the JSON string, which is a safe operation with no direct influence from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the hardcoded JSON string (source) to the 'json.loads' function (sink), returning a Python dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the JSON string is static and hardcoded, and no dynamic or external data input is involved.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'json' library, defines a JSON string containing version metadata, and provides a function to parse and return this data. No user input, network activity, or file I/O occurs. The JSON content appears to be generated automatically by a versioning tool, and no suspicious or malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for retrieving version metadata from a hardcoded JSON string. It does not perform any malicious actions, contains no secrets or backdoors, and has no security concerns.",
