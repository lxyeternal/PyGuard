{
  "purpose": "Provides Tornado request handler mixins for Kerberos and simple authentication methods, relying on environment variables, request headers, and filesystem checks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (KRB5_KTNAME), request headers ('Authorization'), filesystem (keytab existence), hostname (gethostname).",
  "sinks": "HTTP response headers ('WWW-Authenticate'), error handling via web.HTTPError, setting request headers, environment variable modification.",
  "flows": "Input from headers and environment variables processed through authentication functions, leading to user retrieval or error responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code; dynamic import of kerberos is standard for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard authentication mixins with proper error handling and environment checks. No malicious or backdoor behavior is evident. Use of external kerberos library and environment variables is typical. No obfuscation or suspicious data flows are present. The code's purpose is legitimate, and the security implications are minimal, aside from the acknowledged insecurity of simple auth via URL parameter.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of authentication helpers for Tornado, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
