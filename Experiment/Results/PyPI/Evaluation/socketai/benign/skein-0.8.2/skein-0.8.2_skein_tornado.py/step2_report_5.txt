  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report concludes the code is standard, with no malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. The dynamic import of kerberos is typical and not suspicious. No obfuscation or malicious payloads detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score (0.2) aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The malware score of 0 is justified, as no malicious code is present. The confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard authentication mechanisms, no malicious behavior, and noting the insecure nature of simple auth but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious activity is detected. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the potential exposure via HTTP headers and environment variables but finds no malicious intent or backdoors. The use of kerberos library and environment variables is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score matches the analysis; no malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing standard authentication flows, no suspicious code, and reliance on external modules.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature; no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard implementation, with no malicious code or obfuscation, and notes potential security concerns are related to deployment, not code itself.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the analysis; the code appears legitimate.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's nature—standard authentication mixins with no malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, as no obfuscation is detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 across all reports reflects a low security risk, primarily due to potential misconfiguration or insecure simple auth, but not malicious code.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minor, mostly operational/security concerns, not malicious.\n\nThe scores are consistent with the detailed reasoning. No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. The code is a standard implementation of authentication helpers with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.",
